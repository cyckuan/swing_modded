ANALYSIS: FEW ADS FOR ONLINE RETAILERS ARE AIMED AT MAINSTREAM
USERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) At a time when Y2K looms smaller by the day, it looks
as if the really big deal will be 1999.com.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers that sell on the Internet _ or dot-coms, to use the
imprecise shorthand _ have lately been all over your television
dial: Egghead.com, Toys.com, Monster.com, DSports.com, Ditech.com
and 800.com, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   And, like Santa's elves, they've been busily creating almost a
subgenre of television advertising _ a recognizable,
loaded-with-attitude blizzard of pitches, the most notable of which
may be the 30-second messages from our friends at Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe what you hear in the business media, these
dot-coms are part of the new economy of e-commerce. Soon, we are
told, all of America will be shopping on the Internet. Whether it's
for cat food, computers, stocks, a new job, DVDs, BVDs ... if
you're not buying these things on the Web by now, it's easy to feel
as if you're the only one who is not.
</P>
<P>
   That's a myth, of course _ plenty of shoppers are still crowding
the malls, spurred on by tradition and mild weather. But the
dot-coms are spending furiously on advertising to make you think
otherwise. By the end of 1999.com, these companies will have
shelled out $2 billion on television advertising, or 15 times what
they spent last year, according to PaineWebber Group.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday, Jeff Bezos, the Amazon.com founder whose company
_ while losing millions of dollars _ has helped foster the
point-and-click revolution that is changing the way Americans shop,
was named Time magazine's person of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a dot-com chief executive makes an appearances on one
of those financial talk shows, the interviewer always asks about
the company's marketing strategy, or the ``growth potential'' for
the next quarter, or what dot-com his or her dot-com is going to
acquire. But never does anyone ask the basic existential questions
a lot of us would like to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Namely: Why is this company in business? And why should we care?
</P>
<P>
   Dot-coms never give us answers to such obvious questions. In
their TV advertising, they give us comedy routines instead.
</P>
<P>
   One current commercial shows a guy dropping his cellular phone
into a urinal while he's, uh, multitasking. Then we're told you can
buy a hands-free cellular phone online. (OK, but what if you're not
an idiot?)
</P>
<P>
   Outpost.com, a computer and software store, uses even less
subtlety in its ad, which made its million-dollar debut in the
Super Bowl. A well-dressed man sits in a comfortable chair and
explains that the company thought the best way to get viewers'
attention would be to show a marching band being hunted down by
jackals. With that, we cut to a few seconds of something that looks
sort of like the promised melee.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Bob Newhart plays a nervous company chief
mailing out recall notices with Stamps.com. Wacky product testers
try out wacky products for Gifts.com. Something called a ``fogdog''
howls at the end of the ads for Fogdog.com. (Here's a quiz for you
couch potatoes: What does Fogdog sell?)
</P>
<P>
   The use of edgy humor and the nearly nonexistent sales pitch has
defined dot-com ads in 1999. But once everyone starts using the
same approach, its distinctiveness vanishes, as does viewer recall.
(Answer to above pop quiz: Sporting goods.)
</P>
<P>
   That is why Amazon.com's spirited and joyfully retro holiday ad
campaign is such a revelation. Instant classics when they hit the
airwaves last month, the Amazon ads sing their way into viewers'
hearts and carry with them a powerfully simple message.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, a veritable granddaddy among Internet companies, created
five 30-second spots based on the TV variety shows of days gone by.
In their use of color, wardrobe, casting and music, these ads look
and feel as if they came right out of a time capsule buried in the
Kennedy administration.
</P>
<P>
   We watch an all-men's chorus, decked out in sweater vests,
cheerfully belting out tunes to a bouncy polka beat. The lyrics are
flashed on the bottom of the screen in primitive TV letters. All
that's missing is Mitch Miller.
</P>
<P>
   And what songs they sing:
</P>
<P>
   I spent two minutes
</P>
<P>
   Two whole minutes
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes shopping for your gift
</P>
<P>
   And it was so pleasant
</P>
<P>
   Getting credit for a present
</P>
<P>
   That was really super easy to give
</P>
<P>
   The commercials are mesmerizing. The songs are hilarious, with
enough squaresville in them to stand apart from the rest of the
dot-com pack.
</P>
<P>
   (Another song, extolling the joys of being done with Christmas
shopping, includes the lines, ``Nothing else to do today//But worry
about Y2K//Soaking in a bubble bath//With 15 days to go.'')
</P>
<P>
   Amazon chose this campaign because it appealed to audiences of
all ages and because it invoked an earlier time when _ true or not
_ people seemed to be less hassled during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think shopping online is becoming a new tradition,''
explained an Amazon spokesman. ``It saves time, and you have more
time to do things that the holidays are traditionally all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amazon campaign assumes that viewers are intimidated by
online shopping. To these people, Amazon offers an oddly comforting
incentive: Shop with us and you'll be offline in no time. Just two
minutes, two whole minutes, and you're done, the phone line is
free, and you're in the next room styling homemade Christmas cards
with glitter and glue.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that eventually e-commerce is going to be, as
William Shatner tells us in those Priceline.com ads, ``big, really
big.'' But it isn't now. According to figures from Jupiter
Communications, a research firm specializing in e-commerce,
consumers will spend $6 billion online this holiday season, a
fraction of their offline purchases. Four out of five persons who
have Internet access won't go near an online mall this season.
</P>
<P>
   Far from changing these consumer attitudes, the rash of
look-alike dot-com ads may have the opposite effect. With their
sneering, hipper-than-thou approach, they make the Internet seem as
cluttered and uninviting as ever to mainstream users. With Amazon
as the notable exception, it's hard to see how the dot-coms will
have much to show in January for their holiday spending spree.

SMALL STATE'S DECISIONS LOOM LARGE ON POLITICAL LANDSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Inside Poor Pierre's Restaurant on Main Street,
the coffee is steaming hot, the windows are fogged from the
December chill and the little boxes of cornflakes behind the
counter are stacked in a neat pile.
</P>
<P>
   The political landscape, however, in this presidential
bellwether state is not quite so orderly.
</P>
<P>
   With almost six weeks to go before New Hampshire holds its
first-in-the-nation presidential primary, front-runners have become
underdogs and yesterday's underdogs now lead the pack. But that's
in keeping with New Hampshire voters' rich tradition of rattling
front-runners and winnowing the political field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's so much that we like to knock off
front-runners,'' said Don Mayo, a Nashua insurance agent, as he
buttered a grilled blueberry muffin. ``New Hampshire voters may be
more selective as to who they believe to be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   For so small a state, New Hampshire voters exercise an influence
far greater than political logic dictates. For instance, California
is bigger and more diverse politically, ethnically and economically
_ a much more accurate microcosm of America. But candidates often
don't get farther west than the Vermont border if they can't
survive New Hampshire's scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Its voters have always been conservative, but probably are less
so lately because of the influx of younger, better-educated and
more-affluent families to the bedroom communities in the south,
near the Massachusetts high-tech corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, recent surveys have shown that more registered
Republicans who plan to vote in the primary are moderates rather
than conservatives on issues such as gun control, abortion and
campaign-finance reform. Polls also show that independents, the
largest voting bloc at about 37 percent, may split evenly this time
among Democratic and Republican candidates; in 1996, Democrats
captured only about a third.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the voters have long been romanced as flinty and
independent.
</P>
<P>
   The reality probably is that New Hampshire voters just pay
closer attention. ``We're immersed in it,'' said Kathy Sullivan,
the state's Democratic chairwoman. ``We've been living with it for
months, and the intensity keeps increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   They have a history of thumping the front-runner, the way they
did to then-Sen. Bob Dole in 1996 when they awarded the state to
GOP rival Pat Buchanan, and to Democrat Walter Mondale in 1984 when
they gave the nod to Gary Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting President Lyndon Johnson got fewer votes than expected
in 1968, and later chose not to seek re-election. The state also
proved fatal to the efforts of top contenders Edmund Muskie in 1972
and Paul Tsongas in 1992. And they even won the state's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, George McGovern, with 35 percent of the Democratic vote,
was all set to give a concession speech on primary night in 1972
until his aides convinced him that Muskie's 44-percent victory did
not meet expectations. Muskie was soon out, and the little-known
McGovern went on to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing can still be winning if you make it a close second and
exceed expectations,'' said Dante Scala, who teaches politics at
St. Anselm College in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Decisive political moments are a staple in New Hampshire too.
Muskie's notorious tear on the cheek (or was it a snowflake?),
Dole's snappish retort to President Bush in 1988 to ``quit lying
about my record'' and Gennifer Flowers' public declaration of an
affair with Bill Clinton all occurred there.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many front-runners have limped out of New Hampshire to
oblivion,'' said Dave Carney, a Republican strategist from the
state who worked for Dole, the 1996 GOP nominee. ``The momentum in
a campaign can change overnight. It can change drastically and can
change dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Democratic contenders Vice President Al Gore and
former Sen. Bill Bradley are trading the lead back and forth. Among
the Republicans, Sen. John McCain of Arizona has surged ahead of
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a week goes by without a motorcade rolling through some
town. And there are rallies, town meetings and makeshift parades as
candidates and their entourages sweep into town and crowd into
diners and Dunkin' Donuts to talk to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primary,'' said a retired man at the counter at Poor Pierre's.
``It's spelled C-I-R-C-U-S.''
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't take a game of six degrees of separation to find
someone _ it may be a relative or a neighbor _ who has been called
by a presidential candidate, his campaign or a pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Lajoie, a Nashua electrician, said he had been asked in
1992 by the local Democrats to work for then-Gov. Bill Clinton of
Arkansas. ``I said I wouldn't work for anybody unless I met him
face to face,'' said Lajoie, a coffee cup in one hand, an unlighted
Marlboro in the other.
</P>
<P>
   So he met Clinton at the local Holiday Inn, agreed to help his
campaign and has gotten a Christmas card from him every year since.
</P>
<P>
   While the closest encounter most Americans have with a
presidential candidate is seeing him on television, about 30
percent of New Hampshire's voters meet one face to face for more
than five minutes. That's what Dayton Duncan, who wrote a book
about the 1988 presidential primary, found based on his experience
as a press aide to Democratic then-nominee Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 30 percent is just phenomenal,'' said Duncan, who lives
in New Hampshire. ``That simply doesn't happen anyplace else.''

   RUSSIA-VOTERS (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ Her husband walked
through mushy snow, still in his thick brown knit sleeping shirt,
to vote early in Russia s parliamentary elections Sunday, but Maria
Chashena, 78 and stiff, was in no shape to get out. So Sunday
afternoon a delegation of election officials trudged to her

she sat beneath a yellowed poster of Russian czars, committing
democracy. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (MozdoK, Russia) _ Mikhail A. Kashpurin is a
frail old man with years of valorous service in the Soviet army, an
unblemished labor record and a story to tell. It boils down to
this. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The place was
Grozny and the time was Russia's ongoing military campaign. By

   NIGERIA-WOMEN-SOCCER (Minna, Nigeria) _ Nigerian men have long
dominated soccer in Africa, and many of them rank among the
highest-paid players in Europe. But despite the strong showing by
the Nigerian women's team in last summer's World Cup competition in
the United States, where it reached the quarterfinals, girls have
long been discouraged in Nigeria and elsewhere on the continent
from taking part in sports. By Norimitsu Onishi.

have hundreds of thousands of genetic variations, and drug
companies are avidly searching for them, convinced that they can
use collections of them to identify patients who will benefit from
drugs, patients who will not and patients who will suffer troubling
side effects. Eventually, they say, this research will lead them

   PA-DEER-DEBATE (Valley Forge, Pa.) _ Of all the creatures caught
up in suburban sprawl, few possess a more idyllic sanctuary than
the white-tail deer herd of Valley Forge National Historical Park
as they graze and multiply in safety while shopping malls and home
developments boom on the horizon. And few creatures are more
bedeviled by the deer's position of privilege _ by the 1,000-member
herd's annual growth rate of 20 percent as park hunting is
absolutely barred _ than the neighboring homeowners of the Valley
Forge Citizens for Deer Control Inc. They intercept deer daily on

<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTERNET-ECONOMY (Undated) _ Historians say the Internet
should be viewed mainly as the latest advance in communications, a
successor to the telegraph and the telephone, more a technological
step than a leap forward. Still, whether labeled a revolution or an
evolution, the Internet's impact on the economy seems destined to
become greater and greater. By Steve Lohr. (With graphic showing

</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-REFLECTIONS (Undated) _ When eight well-known executives
were asked to sum up the most important characteristics of the last
100 years in an epitaph for the 20th century, they invariably
talked about the powerful impact of technology in all its myriad
forms: the airplane, television, computers and the Internet. By
Reed Abelson.
</P>

   OUTLOOK-READER-VISIONS (Undated) _ Asked for proposals to
improve the human condition in the next century, people were
generous with their ideas. Many visions fell into broad categories

offers a sampling of responses.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-DEMOGRAPHICS (Undated) _ Five years into a booming
economy, America is ``depleting its pool of available workers'' _ a
warning often heard from Alan Greenspan. But beyond the pool of
known recruits lies another mass of untapped labor that can supply
an expanding work force _ and sustain a robust economy _ into the
new decade. This labor in reserve consists mainly of women and
potential immigrants. By Louis Uchitelle.

   OUTLOOK-CURRENCY (Undated) _ The history of money and its

   OUTLOOK-BIOTECH (Undated) _ For several years, the big quest in

for recklessly speeding toward such a future. By Barnaby J. Feder.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-HEALTH (Undated) _ Americans who have complaints about
the health care system may soon be in luck _ or maybe not. Many

States to be overhauled so remarkably during the next two decades
that many patients will not be able to recognize it. By David J.
Morrow.

made by Congress this year in laws that separated commercial banks,
investment banks and insurance companies, a wave of consolidation
is expected among financial services companies, creating more
conglomerates like Citigroup, the first company in the United
States to combine an insurer with a commercial bank, an investment
bank and a securities brokerage firm, the experts say. By Patrick
McGeehan.

   OUTLOOK-SHOPPING (Undated) _ The changes remaking retailing come
not only in the medium shoppers use to make their purchases but in
what they expect their dollars to buy _ which is a lot more than
they did even five years ago. In the end, it is less the Internet
that is transforming traditional retailing as this century closes,
than one giant discounter: Wal-Mart Stores. By Leslie Kaufman. (ART

<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTERNET (Undated) _ Future developments in the Internet
regarding business should come in waves. Those who are studying the
relationship between business and the still-primitive and slow
Internet say that in five or 10 years those waves could well
reshape the way business is conducted. This transformation will

SEAHAWKS AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN LATEST COLLAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The pain of the Seahawks' latest loss was evident in
the way Sean Dawkins buried his face in his hands as he sat
silently in front of his locker.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration of the team's fourth loss in a row was obvious
as Jon Kitna fought back tears as he tried to explain how the
Seahawks had rallied to score 10 points in the final 1 minute, 47
seconds of regulation only to lose on a bizarre play in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The utter disgust of watching Broncos linebacker Glenn Cadrez
return a fumble 37 yards to give Denver a 36-30 victory was
apparent from the sour looks that covered the faces of several
players as they tried to explain how the Seahawks had found yet
another way to let yet another game slip away.
</P>
<P>
   What was a once seemingly insurmountable three-game lead in the
AFC West is now a one-game deficit, as the Seahawks prepare for
what they have been talking about during their month of losses _ a
matchup next week against the division-leading Kansas City Chiefs
in the Kingdome that has become the equivalent of a playoff game of
the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-6 Seahawks still can win the division if they beat the 9-5
Chiefs on Sunday and then beat the New York Jets on the road on
Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our playoffs have started,'' Kitna said. ``We've been asking
for a playoff game around here for 10 years. Our playoffs have
started. It's do-or-die. When the playoffs come around, it's all
about survival. We're in the playoffs now. So it's about survival
and whatever it takes to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Chiefs have helped the Seahawks fritter away
their three-game lead by winning four in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Going down ...
</P>
<P>
   Second floor, er, place: Blown opportunities. Massive
misfortune. Dropped passes. Missed tackles. Self-doubt.
Second-guessing. And an wide array of wouldas, couldas and
shouldas.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Seahawks can even entertain realistic thoughts of
beating the Chiefs, they must find a way to stop their fall down an
elevator shaft.
</P>
<P>
   It was no different Sunday, on a bitterly cold afternoon at Mile
High Stadium where the wind-chill was 10 degrees at kickoff and
closer to zero by the time the 3 hour, 28 minute game had ended.
</P>
<P>
   The defense allowed season-highs of 36 points and 430 yards _
including 260 yards rushing that was their worst performance by 93
yards; 183 of those by Broncos rookie Olandis Gary.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna lost two fumbles that led to nine points by the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   The special teams got the snowball rolling in the wrong
direction by allowing Broncos rookie Chris Watson to return the
game's first punt 81 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone, it seemed, contributed to the Seahawks being
penalized 12 times for 118 wrong-way yards _ both season highs. Or
is that lows?
</P>
<P>
   In looking for a quick-fix that can stem this self-destructive
tidal wave before the Chiefs show up for the showdown, where do the
Seahawks even begin?
</P>
<P>
   As guard Brian Habib said, ``It's not one specific thing. It's
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Seahawks took losing to a new, historic level. This
was only the second overtime game in NFL annals to end on a fumble
return for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the hardest way to lose, probably,'' Kitna said. ``We
still control our own destiny _ and that's a good thing. But until
we learn how to win games, that doesn't do us any good.''
</P>
<P>
   For two never-say-die minutes Sunday, it appeared the Seahawks
had remembered how to win _ and how to make the plays they were
routinely making during their five-game winning streak that staked
them to that three-game lead in the division.
</P>
<P>
   After Kitna found Derrick Mayes with a 36-yard touchdown pass
with 54 seconds remaining to cut the Broncos' lead to 30-27, the
Seahawks executed a text-book on-side kick. Todd Peterson topped
the ensuing kickoff and safety Kerry Joseph made a leaping grab of
the ball just as it had traveled the required 10 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph's look-what-I-found play gave the Seahawks the ball at
the Seattle 42-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna then found Dawkins with a 26-yard pass at the Broncos' 32.
After three incompletions, Peterson kicked a 45-yarder to tie the
score and send the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming back from a 10-point deficit with a minute-something to
go, that's the determination of a team that knows it's not out of
it,'' said defensive end Phillip Daniels, who sacked Denver
quarterback Brian Griese twice.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was even more encouraging, as the defense turned
in its first three-and-out of the game to open the overtime period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we go that three-and-out, I really felt like we were
going to win,' Daniels said. ``A lot of strange things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what happened on the play that ended the game,
which followed a play when Kitna overthrew a wide-open Joey
Galloway at the Broncos' 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks were in their five-wide receiver set that has
produced some big plays in recent games. Kitna had two option
routes on either side and was just about to unload the ball to Mike
Pritchard when Broncos cornerback Ray Crockett unloaded on Kitna.
</P>
<P>
   Crockett came free on a blitz, as the Seahawks were left with
only five linemen to block and no back in the backfield to pick up
blitzers. Crockett drilled Kitna, who fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great call,'' Crockett said. ``We ran a zone blitz.
It was my call, time for me to make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Crockett made his play, and Cadrez finished it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both came on blitzes from the outside,'' Cadrez said. ``I
heard the hit, and I turned around to look for the ball and there
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, here the Seahawks are _ out of first place for the
first time since Oct. 17, when they were 3-2; and facing a must-win
against the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season's not over,'' coach Mike Holmgren said. ``But
bouncing back from a loss like this is a challenge. But you find
out what you're made of in situation like this.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ All season, the Cowboys have been telling themselves they
are better than their record indi-cates.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A successful field goal here, a completed pass there, one less
injury _ and they might lead the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   But after another loss to a non-playoff team, the Cowboys are
starting to realize they are exactly what their record shows _ a
.500 team in serious danger of having the season end in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was the New York Jets coming from behind for a
22-21 victory. But like no other this season, this defeat came at
Texas Stadium before 64,271 disillusioned fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are again after seven losses saying what we could do
and how good we can be,'' running back Emmitt Smith said. ``Who are
we kidding?''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were well aware of the situation when Sunday's game
started.
</P>
<P>
   NFC East rivals Washington (8-6) and the New York Giants (7-7)
had lost before the Cowboys kicked off. Had Dallas won, it would
have pulled into a tie for the division lead and _ because of a
pair of victories over the Redskins _ would lead the division.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Cowboys remain tied with New York, a game out of
the lead. Even if the Cowboys win their final two games _ Christmas
Eve in New Orleans and Jan. 2 at home against the Giants _ the
Redskins must lose once if Dallas is to win the East.
</P>
<P>
   Washington plays at San Francisco a week from today and hosts
Miami on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had everything sitting just like we wanted it, but we
didn't take advantage,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, the Cowboys are a .500 team. That means win
one, lose one. And since they beat the Philadelphia Eagles last
week, it wasn't too shocking that the Cowboys found themselves on
the losing end this time.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this team hasn't put up back-to-back wins since
starting the season 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it says about this team,'' quarterback Troy
Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing it says is that this team can't hold a lead when it
matters. Though they trailed early after the Jets kicked a pair of
field goals, the Cowboys controlled play in the second quarter and
early in the third to take a 21-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But they let the Jets score the final nine points while picking
up just three first downs on their last six possessions.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-8, the Jets are last in the AFC East. At 7-7, the Cowboys
are smack in middle of the NFC playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be 7-7 and think of ourselves as a playoff
team,'' Aikman said. ``But we still could be.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Cowboys had a shot at being 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   After New York went on top 22-21, the Cowboys started at their
16 with 1:35 remaining, and Aikman immediately passed to Rocket
Ismail for 23 yards. Thirty more yards, and the Cowboys had a
chance for a long field goal. Forty yards, and three points would
have been almost certain.
</P>
<P>
   But they went no further.
</P>
<P>
   Jets cornerback Aaron Glenn broke up another attempt to Ismail.
A second-down pass aimed at Chris Brazzell was nearly intercepted.
A third-down try for Eric Bjornson was knocked away by Victor
Green, and a fourth-down try for Ismail was underthrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we could get in a position to get a field goal, but
we failed to do that,'' Aikman said. ``I failed to do that, and I
take responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He failed more than he succeeded Sunday, managing only 158 yards
in the air on 12-of-28 passing. He was picked off twice. More
significant, the Cowboys converted only three of 12 third-down
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we always play just good enough to win,''
Brazzell said. ``But when you play just good enough, you sometimes
don't pull it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were moments. For one six-play drive in the third
quarter, the Cowboys looked like a playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys ran the ball on five of six plays, something they
thought would be nearly impossible against the Jets' tough run
defense. Smith carried for 13, 10 and five yards. Robert Thomas
gained 10, and the Cowboys found themselves at the New York 27.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail then went left on an end around and sprinted untouched
into the end zone. That score put Dallas ahead 21-13 with 11:18 to
play in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the offense's last gasp. The final six possessions
ended in two interceptions, three punts and Aikman's final four
misfires. The Cowboys averaged four plays per drive on their final
six possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to go from good to bad in the game,'' said
Smith, who accounted for 110 of Dallas' 195 rushing yards. ``We
make plays at times, and at times we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the Cowboys scored three touchdowns, though special
teams played major roles in the first two.
</P>
<P>
   The first came after Deion Sanders returned a punt 26 yards to
the New York 41 early in the second period. The Cowboys then
sprinted to the end zone on four plays, all involving Smith, who
carried three times for 27 yards and was on the receiving end of a
14-yard touchdown pass in the right flat.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Dallas led 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   The second TD was a special-teams highlight.
</P>
<P>
   After a five-play drive stalled at the New York 20, the Cowboys
set up for a field goal. Bjornson, the holder, took the snap and
sprinted down the right sideline, scoring easily.
</P>
<P>
   In between, cornerback Kevin Smith was flagged for a 34-yard
interference penalty on Dedric Ward, setting up the Jets' first
touchdown. The penalty moved New York to the Dallas one, and
quarterback Ray Lucas passed to fullback Richie Anderson for a 13-7
New York lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas moved his team into contention, marching the Jets 62 yards
on seven plays early in the third quarter. He passed to Blake
Spence for a two-yard touchdown but failed to run in the two-point
conversion, leaving the Cowboys up 21-19.
</P>
<P>
   It stayed that way until the Jets' 11-play drive that ended in
John Hall's 37-yard field goal with 1:35 remaining. Curtis Martin
was the workhorse, carrying on nine plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 7-7 and on the verge of not making the playoffs,''
Emmitt Smith said. ``I thought we were a better ballclub than what
we showed today, but we showed today we're not.''

HAWKS DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The NFL recently banned the throat-slash gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Seahawks, the prohibition did not also
include the choke.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have a solid grip on their own windpipes. There is
no sign of let-up.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-week period that borders on the astonishing, the
Seahawks have gone from darkhorse contenders for the Super Bowl to
longshots to get out of their own way.
</P>
<P>
   It's strictly mental. No team is 8-2 in the NFL without having
considerable talent and a substantial plan. But the head game is
crucial, especially in December. And the Seahawks are a month into
one apparently endless concussion.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have taken that 8-2 record and worn it like an
anvil strapped to a piano. Sunday, they came into their old
nightmare shack, Mile High Stadium, in a complete role reversal _
they were the AFC West co-leaders and the 4-9 Broncos were out of
playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing changed. The Seahawks played like losers and the Broncos
like winners, prevailing in overtime 36-30 in as screwball a finish
as the worst Leslie Nielsen movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brutal,'' guard Pete Kendall said. ``We overcame everything
that came our way, and they just made one more play than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the game ended,'' safety Merton Hanks said, ``was
extremely bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks were consumed with the freakishness of the final
play _ Denver linebacker Glenn Cadrez's 37-yard touchdown run with
a fumble from sacked quarterback Jon Kitna _ which allowed them to
ignore the events that made them vulnerable to the improbable.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks can say they scored 30 points at Mile High Stadium
on a day colder than a mean preacher's stare.
</P>
<P>
   They can say that in scoring 10 points in the final 1:47 to tie
the game, they showed heart.
</P>
<P>
   They can say that they were screwed multiple times by poor
officiating, and that a lucky bounce of the ball led to the second
overtime loss by fumble return in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   All true.
</P>
<P>
   So what?
</P>
<P>
   Playoff-caliber teams overcome. They get in the last punch. They
have a trick left. Somewhere in the sleeve, vest or fedora, there
is an ace.
</P>
<P>
   The first 10 weeks, the Seahawks displayed a few of those. Now,
they are played out. Spent. Consumed with their own shortcomings,
unable to conduct themselves with a division lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic as was their late comeback to force overtime, it was no
more representative of their level of play than was Cadrez's fumble
return representative of the Broncos defense.
</P>
<P>
   What was truly representative of the Seahawks' play in the last
month happened after cornerback Willie Williams' interception set
up the offense on the Denver 47-yard line with 8:40 left in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   After four plays, the Seahawks had a first down at the 12. On
three of the next four snaps, they committed five-yard penalties:
</P>
<P>
   -- False start on right tackle Grant Williams;
</P>
<P>
   -- Illegal shift (two men in motion);
</P>
<P>
   -- Delay of game.
</P>
<P>
   The officials missed another obvnalty: a team SAT in
single digits.
</P>
<P>
   The three penalties were part of a season-high 118 yards in
punishments, and forced the Seahawks to take a field goal when a
touchdown would have given them a 24-23 lead. They even had that
TD, an endzone catch by Sean Dawkins, but it was wiped out by the
delay penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The three drive-killing penalties were a hallmark of a team
unsure of itself in a pressure situation. In the run to 8-2, there
was relatively little pressure, because the Seahawks used the
entirety of the expiring decade to beat down expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But expectations blossomed, inspired by the previously golden
touch of the new head man, Mike Holmgren. But there are things in
sports that can't be taught, only experienced.
</P>
<P>
   A group of players who had never been there before began to
swoon from the heights. A month later, the only thing that might
save them is a call to NASA for some heat-resistant tiles from the
space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The dive has been so precipitous that the uninitiated tend to
drift toward explanations involving the fates and the supernatural.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in jinxes, necessarily,'' Holmgren said.
``Games are decided by the way this one was.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Kitna: ``That's garbage. I don't believe in stuff like
that. It's not hocus pocus. It's not magic.''
</P>
<P>
   They're right. Tempting as it is to believe that the Kingdome
was built on an Indian burial ground, and that Ken Behring is still
haunting the halls in Kirkland, the pragmatic explanation is that
these Seahawks can't take the pressure of success.
</P>
<P>
   All they have to do to disprove it is beat the most resurgent
club in the NFL. In beating the Chiefs 31-19 earlier in Kansas
City, the Seahawks have established they have talent to do so;
Sunday it comes down to guts.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ The Indianapolis Colts have become the kind of
warm-hearted Christmas story even Scrooge would love.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite back-to-back records of 3-13, the Colts began the season
hoping to prove they were merely leasing the AFC East basement. Few
took their worst-to-first goal seriously, because they play in the
NFL's best division, which sent four teams to the playoffs last
season.
</P>
<P>
   But to see the Colts is to believe in them. Their transformation
from frogs to princes became official Sunday when they beat
Washington 24-21 to clinch the AFC East title, securing a
first-round bye and a second-round game at the RCA Dome, where
57,013 cheered Indianapolis' first division crown since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   After the Colts defeated NFC East leader Washington to elevate
their winning streak to 10 games and to improve their record to
12-2, quarterback Peyton Manning led them out of the dressing room
and back onto the field for a curtain call in front of thousands of
fans who continued to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans have been a big part of our success,'' said Manning,
who threw two touchdown passes. ``This was our chance to thank them
for supporting us. There's no question that crowd noise is a factor
for every team that comes here, and as a team we certainly
appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Manning and his teammates circled the field signing
autographs and shaking hands, his father, Archie Manning, stood in
the tunnel watching his son lead his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any idea they'd come this far this fast,'' Archie
Manning said. ``I was one of those 8-8 guys. I'm excited for Peyton
and the team because they've played hard, and they've played well
against a real tough schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie running back Edgerrin James scored their first and last
touchdowns on a 37-yard catch and a two-yard run to help the Colts
improve their record to 6-1 against teams in or tied for first
place. They are now 7-2 against teams with winning records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a fast turnaround, definitely faster than we
expected,'' Peyton Manning said after completing 23 of 37 passes
for 298 yards. ``We were confident we'd be good, but we didn't know
we'd be this good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best division in football, and we've beaten a lot
of good teams. But this is just another step to a higher goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts want to win Super Bowl XXXIV, but the road to Atlanta
may go through Jacksonville for any AFC team. If the Colts continue
to play as they have been, there may be no stopping them.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins resisted until the end. They led 10-7 in the first
half and 13-10 in the fourth quarter, despite losing running back
Stephen Davis, their leading rusher and scorer who aggravated an
ankle injury in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the game's last two minutes, the Redskins scored a
touchdown, added a two-point conversion and recovered an onside
kick to leave them a field goal from overtime. But quarterback Brad
Johnson's fourth-down pass from their 47 was incomplete, leaving
Washington with an 8-6 mark and a trip to San Francisco and a home
game against Miami left on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was ours to control at the end, but we didn't make
the plays,'' Redskins defensive tackle Dan Wilkinson said. ``I
never feel good about losing, and this one hurts. The bottom line
is that we've got to win our last two games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins, who didn't commit a turnover, will never know if
they could have pulled this one out if Davis had stayed healthy.
</P>
<P>
   After James made a fingertip catch on Manning's 37-yard pass for
a 7-0 lead, the Colts fell behind 10-7 when Brett Conway kicked a
23-yard field goal and Albert Connell caught a 48-yard touchdown
pass for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Vanderjagt's 43-yard field goal made it 10-10, but Conway
countered with a 32-yarder and the 13-10 halftime lead for the
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Before Davis left, he had 70 yards rushing. The Redskins
finished with 151 yards rushing compared to Indianapolis' 88, but
no one provided the kind of game-breaking weapon Davis has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a big difference when we lost Stephen,'' receiver
Michael Westbrook said. ``We lost a lot of momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Redskins forced three turnovers and
limited the Colts to 19 yards rushing, but Indianapolis didn't
change its game plan at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best things we do offensively is to run the ball,''
Colts coach Jim Mora said. ``I have to credit (offensive
coordinator) Tom Moore and the offensive coaches. They've got
patience.''
</P>
<P>
   James rebounded from his 19-yard performance in the first half
for 70 more in the second. And he got them the hard way, by
breaking tackles and moving the piles.
</P>
<P>
   James' 20-yard run to the Washington one set up Manning's
one-yard touchdown pass to tight end Ken Dilger that gave the Colts
a 17-13 lead early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins retaliated by moving to the Indianapolis 31.
Conway's 49-yard field goal was blocked by Jason Belser. The Colts
responded with another scoring drive that James finished with a
two-yard touchdown run to make it 24-13 with 5:57 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins made it interesting by going 66 yards in seven
plays. Brian Mitchell scored on a six-yard run, and Johnson threw
the two-point conversion pass to Westbrook, putting Washington
behind 24-21 with 1:24 left.
</P>
<P>
   Washington receiver James Trash controlled Conway's onside kick
at the Washington 46, but the Colts' defense allowed only one net
yard in four plays to seal the win.

AFTER THE FLOOD: EAST CAROLINA RISES ABOVE ADVERSITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Jeff Kerr plays in a linebacker's violent
world. East Carolina's second-leading tackler has no compassion for
the opposition and when he sees tears, he wants them spilling from
the eyes of smacked-down running backs. With a tree-trunk neck, at
6-foot-4 and 235 pounds, he's not accustomed to being knocked down.
</P>
<P>
   A natural disaster, a relief shelter and a destitute woman
changed that.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates were visiting people who were displaced by the
flooding caused by Hurricane Floyd in September. It was a few days
after East Carolina had dispatched the Hurricanes from Miami,
27-23, in one of the most inspiring victories of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman came up to me and told me she had lost
everything,'' said Kerr, a native of Salisbury, N.C. ``She looked
me right in the eye and said, `Thank you. Thank you for that game.'
And her eyes were filled with tears. She said, `These aren't tears
of sadness, these are tears of happiness.' That's something I'll
always take with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the Pirates' Mobile Alabama Bowl game with TCU on
Wednesday, even if a season-ending loss makes them 9-3, won't
matter as much. At a time when the people of Eastern North Carolina
were suffering from floodwaters left by the hurricane, they
provided a ray of sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a flood of Biblical proportions,'' said East Carolina
chancellor Richard Eakin, noting that the Tar River crested at 30
feet, 17 feet over flood stage. ``When the game ended, I don't
think there was a dry eye in the house. And certainly not mine. I
just realized I had seen something pretty miraculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team probably gave more hope and more realization there
is a tomorrow and the sun will shine tomorrow than anything else
could have done for Eastern North Carolina.'' \Nsubheds:Pride is
back The sun is shining again here. Life appears close to normal.
Holiday shoppers fill the parking lot at The Plaza Mall.
Greenville, home of East Carolina University, appears to be a
typical college town. But the scars are still apparent.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles out of town, nearly 100 displaced families are
living in a makeshift trailer park. Half a mile away, Joseph C.
Randolph is plowing fields of ruined bean and cotton crops. Even
now, nearly three months after Floyd's monsoons, the ground is
still saturated. The tractor's wheels bog down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rough, rough,'' Randolph said of Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd was blamed for 51 deaths in North Carolina. The
damage is estimated at more than $6 billion. More than 48,000
people were forced into shelters.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent recruiting trip, East Carolina coach Steve Logan
said he passed ``thousands'' of trailers and campers that are
housing people who lost their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over,'' he said. ``This disaster blasted this culture
and it's not going away any time soon. It altered peoples' lives
permanently.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an area accustomed to tough times. Logan and others
describe the inhabitants as having chips on their shoulders. This
is tobacco and hog-farming country. To the west, there's Raleigh,
Durham, Chapel Hill, Greensboro, Charlotte _ cities of technology,
medicine and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville mayor Nancy Jenkins grew up in Raleigh and attended
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all very arrogant and probably thought there was
nothing east of Raleigh,'' said Jenkins, who has lived in
Greenville for 37 years. ``Now, we're the mecca of the east. We
used to be called a sleeping giant. We're no longer asleep, we're
alive and thriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such pride, purple pride, in the university. It's
given us a reason to be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina's football program has fueled that pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to tell people we're the only football school in
North Carolina,'' said Pirates defensive back Kevin Monroe, a
Greenville native. ``All those ACC schools are basketball
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Sept. 25, playing in North Carolina State's stadium
because they had been displaced by the disaster, the Pirates
spotted Miami 20 points. In shelters in Greenville, the refugees
listened on radios, rode the roller coaster to the valley of an
apparent loss, then rejoiced in the euphoria of triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time East Carolina wins, it gets your spirit up. And
beating a team like Miami ... '' Randolph said. ``It's like your
car breaks down, the guy right behind you stops and gives you his
car. It just picks your spirit right back up. People were worrying
about how much they lost, what they were going to do. Winning that
game just seemed to give people a boost.''
</P>
<P>
   A hand-painted sign hanging from a campus window seemed to
capture the spirit of the region. ``We're Making It A Habit Of
Beating Hurricanes.'' \Nsubheds:Magic dust The prelude for East
Carolina's inspiring defeat of Miami came with its game at South
Carolina. The Pirates left for Columbia, S.C. on Sept. 17. They had
a police escort out of town. They needed help to find a way out of
town to avoid the rising flood waters.
</P>
<P>
   After beating the Gamecocks, 21-3, Logan told his team the bad
news: The flooding was getting worse. The campus was without
electricity and water. The Pirates would not make it back home for
awhile.
</P>
<P>
   The team stayed in Columbia, S.C. The players had brought just
one change of clothes, so the hotel where they were staying
provided a daily laundry service. The Carolina Panthers donated
practice equipment. South Carolina allowed use of their film rooms.
Weightroom work was done at a Gold's Gym. The Pirates prepared for
the Sept. 25 Miami game by practicing at a local high school. There
was no scout team, so the first-team offense practiced against the
first-team defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, we were thinking about home,'' Monroe said. ``When we
were on the field, we thought about football; that was the only
time things were normal. We couldn't use the phones in our rooms
because it was some sort of NCAA violation, so we had 10, 12 guys
in line using three pay phones.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates were preparing for a game they weren't sure they
would play.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday before the Miami game, there was no water and no
electricity in the East Carolina athletic offices. Some people felt
that athletic director Mike Hamrick and the school's administration
were in the dark when they decided to play the game, but moved its
location to North Carolina State's Carter-Finley stadium in
Raleigh, about 90 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a controversial decision,'' Hamrick said. ``We're in
the midst of the worst disaster ever, we're moving it out of town
and costing us millions of dollars. And we had some second
thoughts. We were getting ready for a game here with porta-potties
and generators.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 20,000 was expected; 45,900 showed up. Some fans
drove north into Virginia, making it a three-hour excursion to
reach the game. Some ticket holders donated their tickets to people
in shelters, who then were bussed to the game. The purple-clad
crowd started to roar in pregame warmups and it didn't end until
they tore down both goalposts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What helped us the most was the fans,'' Kerr said. ``We'd just
make a routine tackle and they'd roar, go nuts. We saw the
enthusiasm ... we played 89 snaps on defense and during the game,
because of the fans, I didn't get tired. Once it was over, I just
collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamrick remembers a full moon in the September sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started to come back, it was like somebody had thrown
magic dust on the field,'' Hamrick said. ``If we had not played
that game, we would have let the disaster defeat us. We would have
sat around and felt sorry for ourselves. Instead, we went over and
beat the nation's No. 9 team, on national television, in our
arch-rival's stadium, our fans tear the goalposts down. Hollywood
wouldn't believe it. If you made a movie or wrote a book about it,
it would have to be fiction.'' \Nsubheds:Football as poetry
Columbine High wins the Colorado state championship six months
after a murderous shooting spree. Texas A&AMP;M defeats Texas after the
bonfire tragedy. And East Carolina gives hope to flood victims who
lost everything. Football, a ``game,'' can provide a unique healing
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing these people had to hope for was for a football
team to beat a nationally ranked, powerhouse football team,'' Kerr
said. ``About all that's in this community is this university. For
a lot of people, the football team is important and that game
turned out to be really special for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan has received hundreds of letters _ and they're still
arriving _ from people effected by the flood. The themes are all
the same: ``I lost everything ... The football team gave me
something to look forward to ... The football team showed me what
perseverance and faith can accomplish. ... If you guys can come
back from being down 20-0, I can come back from this flood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing else you could conjure up to give these people
an emotional lift,'' Logan said. ``Nothing, other than a dramatic
victory as an underdog, would have been more perfect. There was a
poetry to it. It was a mountain-top experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``College football has its warts and stupid people do stupid
things. People say college football is out of control. But in its
inception, it was meant to be something for people to rally behind.
In our case, it's an entire region. This whole thing was college
football at its finest.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Pete Carroll stood near the door to the visiting
coaches' office at Veterans Stadium, looking out on his team's
locker room, his eyes red and tears welling up.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Sunday's humiliating 24-9 loss to the Eagles
that, coupled with the Buffalo Bills' victory over the Arizona
Cardinals Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, ended his team's playoff chances, the
Patriots coach surveyed the room for a moment, then retreated to
his office.
</P>
<P>
   Was he looking for answers? Looking for a reason why his players
couldn't find it in themselves to beat, in Willie McGinest's words,
``one of the worst teams in the league''? Or looking for an escape?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick about what we did,'' said Carroll, who said his team
``squatted'' on the field. ``I can't imagine we would do what we
did. Obviously, y'all saw that. Where that came from . . . that's
as ugly of a performance as you can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Robert Kraft visited Carroll in the office after the game.
Speculation will abound about Carroll's future with the team, and
perhaps this was the last straw.
</P>
<P>
   After starting the season 6-2, the Patriots dropped to 7-7 and
saw their streak of three consecutive playoff appearances come to
an end. Even if the Patriots finish 9-7, they'd lose tie-breakers
to all wild-card contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a team playing for nothing except pride, and they
kicked our ass,'' said Troy Brown, who was the only Patriots bright
spot with five catches for 105 yards and a 32-yard punt return.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to make any sense out of this one. The Eagles
started their third-string quarterback _ Koy Detmer _ and, by and
large, he looked like a third-string quarterback. The Patriots
played without cornerbacks Steve Israel and Ty Law, and both of
their replacements, Kato Serwanga and Tebucky Jones, were burned
for touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe continued to be a mystery. He was 23 of 49 for 331
yards, but had four interceptions, no touchdowns, two fumbles
(losing one), and was sacked six times. Bledsoe was blitzed to
death by the no-name Eagles defense, and the offensive line
provided little resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the coach, the quarterback, or the offensive
coordinator, but there just seems to be no rhyme or reason to why
we call certain plays,'' said veteran tackle Bruce Armstrong, who
gave up three sacks to former Boston College end Mike Mamula.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to blitz, what are the good plays against the
blitz and what are the bad plays? Why does it seem we're always in
bad plays against the blitz? I don't know the answer. I just know
in the past we knew we were going to be successful. Now we call the
plays and come to the line with fingers crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the play-calling was questionable, it's pretty hard to
win when you turn the ball over seven times (four interceptions,
three fumbles). Tony Simmons set the tone when he fumbled the
opening kickoff, with the Eagles recovering at the Patriots 24.
That led to a Norm Johnson 43-yard field goal and a 3-0
Philadelphia lead.
</P>
<P>
   Remember those red zone problems in Indianapolis last week? The
Patriots added a new twist on their first drive Sunday. After they
marched from their 30 to the Eagles 17, Terry Allen fumbled on a
hit by tackle Hollis Thomas and Philadelphia recovered at the 5.
</P>
<P>
   The hapless Eagles didn't do anything with their good fortune
and gave the Patriots a gift when Detmer was hit by Lawyer Milloy
as he released the ball, throwing it into the open arms of Tedy
Bruschi at the Eagles 20. After Allen recovered his own fumble and
Bledsoe was sacked by Mamula for an 8-yard loss, the Patriots
quarterback tossed an interception to Jeremiah Trotter,
underthrowing Shawn Jefferson by a mile.
</P>
<P>
   With the ball at midfield, Detmer followed with one of his
shining moments _ a 50-yard touchdown pass to Torrance Small, who
ran a corner post and left Serwanga on the rug.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the second quarter, the Patriots' struggles were
exemplified by one play. Larry Whigham blocked a Sean Landeta punt,
but with Whigham still on the ground, Philadelphia's Mike Caldwell
picked up the loose ball and ran down the left sideline, eluding
Jerry Ellison for the first down. But the Eagles could not pad
their lead.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the quarter, after a 23-yard field goal by Adam
Vinatieri made it 10-3, Bledsoe threw it long to Jefferson, who had
put a great fake on Al Harris at about the 25. But Jefferson was
off balance as the ball arrived and went out of bounds at the
Eagles 7 for a 31-yard gain. But again, the Patriots fizzled and
had to settle for a 43-yard field goal by Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day. It seemed whenever something good
happened, it was negated by something bad shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   On the kickoff following Vinatieri's second field goal, Brown
recovered a fumble at the Eagles 28. But that merely led to an
interception of Bledsoe by Harris and an 84-yard return that
included a fumble recovered by teammate Brian Dawkins at the 11.
From there, Detmer hit Small for a touchdown and 17-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Before the half ended, the Patriots had one more embarrassing
moment when Vinatieri's 56-yard field goal attempt fell short and
was returned 74 yards by Allen Rossum before Mike Bartrum made a
saving tackle at the 26.
</P>
<P>
   All the Patriots could muster in the second half was a 46-yard
field goal by Vinatieri with 10:17 left in the third quarter. The
Eagles scored again with 1:08 remaining in the third when Detmer
hit former Patriot Dietrich Jells with a bomb. Jones was beaten on
the play, but help was late in coming from Chris Carter, who was
slowed by a hamstring problem but played the whole game anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The second half was an act in offensive futility for the
Patriots, resulting in two punts, two interceptions, a fumble, and
a hail of dropped passes.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots looked like a Triple A affiliate, with nobody ready
for prime time and everyone now primed for a lot of down time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of losing,'' said McGinest. ``I'm tired of losing.''

ARMSTRONG CAN'T BEAR TO WATCH 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ A 34-year-old man who has played for a 1-15 team
might rightfully assume he had endured the worst, but when a player
spends his entire career with the tragi-comedic pigskin troupe
known as the New England Patriots, there is always a new and
shocking surprise in store.
</P>
<P>
   It is bad enough that over a four-season stretch his team has
regressed from being an honorable participant in the Super Bowl to
being a point away from the AFC Championship Game to a first-round
loser in the playoffs to being out of the playoffs entirely. So how
could it get any worse? Is that what you're saying?
</P>
<P>
   Here's how. You can't get into the end zone. Ever. That's how.
</P>
<P>
   ``You explain it to me,'' said 13-year veteran Bruce Armstrong,
who is now fully aware that nobody is ever around this organization
long enough to state with assurance that he has seen everything.
``With the offensive players we have on this team, how can we not
be scoring any points?''
</P>
<P>
   Your New England Patriots have become the Chicago Bulls of the
NFL. Sunday's losing score to the Eagles was 24-9, and in case you
haven't been keeping the weekly tally, be advised that Your New
England Patriots have now scored no touchdowns in the past two
games, two touchdowns in the past four games, and seven touchdowns
in the six games since the bye week that has marked the dividing
line between Hope and Despair for Pete Carroll's demoralized bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Is it time to bring back the quick kick?
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe Sunday threw for 331 yards, but who cares? You
don't win on base hits, field goal percentage, or total yardage.
You don't win very many with a field goal subsistence diet, either.
You win on touchdowns, and if you'd like to pinpoint the reason why
the Patriots can all have their SUVs, pick-up trucks, and campers
packed and ready to go on Jan. 2, it's because they have proven
incapable of scoring touchdowns since the midway mark of this
perplexing season.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure we're all gifted with 20-20 now. We can all say how
deceptive and synthetic those wins over the Jets, Giants, Browns,
Dolphins, Broncos, and Cardinals were, and how anybody who knew
anything about pro football realized that the Patriots were living
on the edge, taking reasonable advantage of a favorable first-half
schedule. And the truth is that a lot of people did feel nervous
about what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, OK. But who foresaw the nature of their stunning
second-half collapse? Who stepped up on Nov. 15 and declared that
over the next six weeks the Patriots would treat the end zone as if
it had been mined? You could see some 31-24 or 28-21 losses, but
17-7? 20-15? 24-9? Even the only victory since the bye was by the
none-too-inspiring score of 13-6. The once-feared New England
Patriots have become the very parody of a professional football
team, at least when those dreaded moments come when they are
actually in possession of the football.
</P>
<P>
   The dreamer in Armstrong suggests that his chances of playing on
a championship team in a Patriots uniform are not completely gone.
He talks about free agency and salary caps and the general
year-to-year volatility of the league, and he can make it all sound
very rational. But the realist in him knows the truth. That
proverbial window of opportunity that was thrown open in 1993 when
Bill Parcells accepted James Busch Orthwein's offer to tinker with
this jinxed franchise has been jammed shut with the toughest nails
money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the headstone:
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPIONSHIP QUALITY PATRIOTS &QC; 
BORN 1993. DIED 1999 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It's over. Bruce Armstrong knows it and he just doesn't
understand why it has to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as bad as I've ever felt,'' he said. ``I have
absolutely no answers. We start out 6 and 2 and we come out in the
the second half and we are not able to get anything done. In my 13
years this is as bad as I've felt. I don't have the answers. Maybe
you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Drew Bledsoe does. ``Whether it's me, the offense, or the
entire team,'' the quarterback said with a sigh, ``we're just not
very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in football there are a lot of ``we's.'' There's the
offense. There's the defense. There are the various special teams.
There is the quarterback. There are the running backs. There are
the wide receivers. There are the offensive linemen. There are the
defensive linemen. There are the linebackers. There are the
defensive backs. And, of course, there are the coaches. There are a
whole lotta ``we's'' who must do their jobs in order for a football
team to win, and no one man can speak for the entire group.
</P>
<P>
   The most Armstrong can speak for is the offense, and he admits
to a feeling of near helplessness that begins with some of the
plays that are being sent in by offensive coordinator Ernie
Zampese.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a bad, bad feeling when plays are called in the
huddle and you just don't have a great feeling about them,'' he
said. ``There used to be times when plays would be called and you
know they'd be successful. Now plays are called and you head to the
line of scrimmage with your fingers crossed. I can just tell you
that there isn't a feeling of flow in the offense. Sometimes you
feel you're just running (pause) plays. We're running a lot of
different people in with a lot of different formations. When it
works, you're a genius. When it doesn't . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was blitzed the entire game, and he was sacked six more
times. Drew Bledsoe being sacked is no longer news, and it would be
nice if somebody could figure out a way to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know they'e going to blitz,'' Armstrong said. ``You watch
the films all week, and you know. So you ask yourself this
question: If you know they're going to blitz, and there are plays
you can run against the blitz and plays you can't run against the
blitz, how come we seem to be sending in plays that don't work
against the blitz?''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is not claiming infallibility. He admits he'd sure
like to have back a certain sequence in which he was beaten by Mike
Mamula. And he knows very well that plenty of good plays were
called, and that, as is the second-half norm, assignments were
blown and passes were dropped and players spoiled all the best
situational coaching expertise by their own atrocious play.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Armstrong knows that there never is one answer when things
deteriorate so completely. ``I'm sure there is enough blame to
spread around,'' he said. But if anyone has a right on this team to
be frustrated, angry, and morose, it is Bruce Armstrong. The
playoffs are out of the question for this year, and he knows that
by the time a Patriots team returns to the Super Bowl he'll be
working on some joint replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is there are two more irrelevant games to play. ``At
this stage of my career,'' he said, ``playing games just for the
sake of playing games is something that wasn't in my plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Let him vent. He's earned the right.

QB SYSTEM AT TCU PRODUCED STUDENT-TEACHER RELATIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Arthur Garcia 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. _ They share the same position and a room on the
road, but on the surface, those are the only similarities between
TCU quarterbacks Casey Printers and Patrick Batteaux.
</P>
<P>
   Printers is the confident freshman starter and Batteaux the cool
senior backup, and despite their roles, both figure prominently in
the Horned Frogs' plans for Wednesday's Mobile Alabama Bowl matchup
with No. 20 East Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Casey provide different things for this offense,'' said
Batteaux, the starter the first two games of the season. ``He's
more of a passing-type quarterback and I'm more of a running-type
quarterback, but we both can do it. He can run the ball and I can
pass it, so we give a little mixture of things to provide the
defense different looks. Having that two-quarterback rotation keeps
defenses on their toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Printers is the prototypical signal caller, a 6-foot-3,
190-pounder with a rocket right arm. The true freshman, a highly
touted recruit from DeSoto last year, spurned programs such as
Notre Dame, Texas A&AMP;M and Arizona State to sign with the Horned
Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   One of only two members of the 1999 recruiting class not
redshirted, Printers went 7-2 as a starter, passing for 1,213 and
eight touchdowns. He was also named one of the 10 best true
freshman in the country by ``Sports Illustrated''.
</P>
<P>
   Batteaux found his way into the offensive backfield quite
differently. The 6-footer came to TCU as receiver in 1996 and
played that position for two seasons, leading the team with 27
catches in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Batteaux moved to quarterback in '98 with the arrival of coach
Dennis Franchione, who wanted a player with Batteaux's speed and
intelligence to run his option-based offense. Not only did Batteaux
combine to run and throw for nearly 1,000 yards, he also led TCU to
a Sun Bowl victory over Southern Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Printers and Batteaux routinely go over game plans in their room
on the road, and the freshman has tried to learn as much as
possible from his backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great deal for me as a true freshman,'' Printers said.
``Patrick is a senior who has been through a lot. Every time I made
a mistake, he would tell me what I did wrong and how I could
correct it. There were definitely more pluses to having Patrick
around then just going out there by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Having Printers and Batteaux on the field in different
situations helped spark the Frogs during the season-ending
four-game winning streak. Though Printers has started since the
third game at Arkansas State, Batteaux has continued to contribute.
He finished second on the team with 333 yards rushing and passed
for another 243. In games against UT-El Paso and SMU, the senior
was in the field to start the second half and the Frogs took
control of both games in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won a lot of games down the stretch for us,'' Printers
said. ``I always liked Patrick's poise. He's poised in every
situation, and that's the main thing I can learn from Patrick.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Batteaux of his late-season play: ``I was just happy to be
in the games playing. It's the last couple of games of my career,
and I just wanted to be prepared to take advantage of my
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-quarterback system sometimes took shape within a drive.
For a change in tempo, Batteaux would replace Printers to run the
option for a few plays before giving way to the freshman on obvious
passing situations. But even more nerve-racking for the defense,
Batteaux might let loose a pass downfield or Printers might take to
the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Hawaii, for example, I did my passes and then Patrick
came in and ran a few options and then he threw a long pass,''
Printers said of the key 34-14 victory that started the winning
streak. ``We kept teams off-balance and guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Franchione has his starting QB coming back, he'll miss
the experience and steady hand of Batteaux. ``Our Casey
Printers-Pat Batteaux change-up hitter had been a great deal for
us,'' Franchione said. ``That'll be hard to replace.''

FIRING LINE A LONG ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Memo to Robert Kraft: Fire whomever you'd like.
</P>
<P>
   Fire a few of them. Fire the lot of them. Fire at them if you
want.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing else to say after Sunday's sorry effort by the
New England Patriots, a group of 53 men purporting to be a
professional football team. The only thing professional about them
is that Kraft will be forced by law to hand them paychecks this
morning for what they did at Veterans Stadium. What they should be
handed is subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   But in the firings, do not stop at the front office or at the
coach's office. Go to the source of the Patriots' problems. Go to
the players' office.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the locker room because the people who populated it Sunday
should be ashamed of themselves. They not only lost to the lowly
Eagles, 24-9, to embarrass themselves and virtually end their phony
playoff hopes (Buffalo sealed the deal Sunday &UR;  &LR; night), but they
quit. Play after play after play, they quit.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again half or more of them stood around at the end of a
play, hands on hips, and watched someone else try to do their job.
Not all of them, but too many of them. Way too many of them.
</P>
<P>
   Not Troy Brown, who played so ferociously right to the final
play, and not aging Bruce Armstrong, and not many of the defensive
players, and frankly not the quarterback you love to hate, who kept
getting up off the ground (6 sacks, 14 hurries, 7 knockdowns, 8
drops) and still threw what should have been two touchdown passes
except that Shawn Jefferson ran out of bounds on one instead of
into the end zone and Terry Glenn dropped the other when the ball
hit him in his expensive pair of hands in the end zone when he was
wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just went out there and squatted,'' a disgusted Pete
Carroll said. ``We got dominated today. It was a disgrace. That's
what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   For once the carefully selected words were gone and what was
laid bare was that Pete Carroll saw everything the rest of the
football world saw. No rose-colored glasses anymore. No political
statements. No effort to put the best face on a gargoyle.
</P>
<P>
   This time he didn't see effort, at least not enough of it. He
didn't see preparation, at least not enough of it. He didn't see
urgency or desire, at least not enough of it.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw was what we all saw: a team with everything to win
playing like it had nothing to lose, including its pride.
</P>
<P>
   What happened Sunday, despite all the talk of the many talented
players supposedly in their locker room, is that the Patriots were
beaten by a better team. A better team that was 3-11 when the game
began. A better team that thought its bye week was next Sunday but
found it came a week early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can beat anybody,'' the denizens of the Patriots' locker
room have said time and time again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can win them all,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do this,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   But they can't and they didn't and they couldn't and the reason
is not schemes and coaches, it is overrated talent and personnel
mistakes and misjudgments by people in charge about who had
character and who did not, and a repeated inability to stand up for
themselves when it was most necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``God forbid we played somebody trying to get into the playoffs
because we would have lost by 40 points,'' said Brown, who is one
of the few who should be re-signed this morning for whatever he's
asking because if Kraft is looking for the definition of a football
player it's not based on size or speed or ability to negotiate the
shuttle run.
</P>
<P>
   A football player is Troy Brown, and there are precious few like
him in the Patriots' locker room these days. There will be one
fewer after free agency begins in March if Kraft doesn't lock Brown
up instead of wasting millions on bigger, faster guys who act like
they're doing him a favor by taking his money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete warned us Saturday,'' Brown said. ``He said he saw a lack
of focus. It showed today from the opening kickoff.'' That's when
Tony Simmons, a second-round draft pick, fumbled after running into
his teammate, a play that was the highlight of his day as he went
without a catch for the third straight game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to get myself ready to play and I hope everybody else
is,'' Brown said. ``This is our profession. You're accountable. The
coaches can only tell you what to do so many times. If you still
don't know what to do, you need to take yourself out of the game.
Fact is, we've been playing like a bunch of front-runners. That's
the bottom line. Like a bunch of front-runners.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, they're not front-runners any more. They're what so many
people said they were back in August, when they acted so deeply
offended that anyone might suggest this football machine was the
fourth best team in the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   Today they are barely that, just as they are barely a .500 team
after a 6-2 start that convinced them they were more than they
appeared to be.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time this talented team has gone 1-5 and scored seven
touchdowns in the last six games. It has not scored more than 17
points since Halloween, which is also the last time it scared
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Such a record is the essence of being a front-runner. When the
going gets tough, the tough get going. When the going gets tough
for the Patriots, they go home. Which is where they'll be when the
playoffs begin in three weeks and rightfully so because despite all
their bluster, when it was time to play this year, they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly didn't look like we were fighting for anything,''
Jefferson said. ``This one was the worst and I'm embarrassed by it.
I would have bet my house this team couldn't come out and manhandle
us, and they did. It was like they were playing for something and
we were playing for nothing. It was embarrassing to be involved in
a game like this. Now all the world will find out what we're made
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Shawn Jefferson: We already know.

BC UPSETS MICHIGAN 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-MICHIGAN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It wasn't close at halftime. It wasn't close at the
end. Michigan at Boston College. You know the outcome, right?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you know Michigan came into Sunday's game at Conte Forum
with a 6-1 record, which included a win over Georgia Tech and a
7-point loss to Duke.
</P>
<P>
   You probably know BC was 5-2, but with few credentials _ five
wins against mid-major competition, and two losses, to UMass and a
bad defeat to Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   So you see the final score _ 89-71 _ and you see a 41-37
rebounding advantage, and you think this is another blowout win for
the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   Think again. BC 89, Michigan 71, which was a fair indication of
the way the game went all afternoon for coach Al Skinner's Eagles,
who Sunday &UR;  &LR; night got on a plane bound for Puerto Rico, where they
will meet Tulsa Tuesday in the first round of the Puerto Rico
Holiday Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's win _ in which the Eagles took a 40-30 halftime lead,
squandered it in the first 10 minutes of the second half, then went
on a 27-8 romp to break the game open _ was both satisfying and
significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, it's the happiest moment we've had in
basketball,'' said BC athletic director Gene DeFilippo, who has
been at The Heights for three years. ``It shows everybody around
the league that basketball here is headed in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   For third-year coach Skinner, it was the highlight of a young
season, not his BC career. ``To me, the most satisfying win was our
first league win (against Notre Dame last season) and it always
will be,'' said Skinner, who seemed to enjoy the game as much as
the rest of the surprisingly noisy Conte Forum crowd of 7,223.
Freshman point guard Troy Bell poured in 28 points, forward Xavier
Singletary added 16 points and seven rebounds, and Jonathan
Beerbohm came off the bench with 14 points and 11 boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a quality win,'' Skinner said. ``A feel-good win. It
was an indication of the potential we can find. It might not be
there every night, but it is there.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a far different BC team than the one that lost a home
game to Harvard last December and prayed it would win any game,
much less one against a talented, although young, team like
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big statement game for us,'' said Bell, who is
having a remarkably smooth freshman season. ``After that loss to
Penn State,'' an 85-57 rout, ``we wanted to show people we can play
at this level against big-time teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Wolverines weren't _ and now won't be _ ranked,
they came in as perhaps the biggest name nonconference team ever to
visit Conte Forum. They also brought a starting lineup of three
freshmen and a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   ``BC came in ready to play,'' said Michigan coach Brian Ellerbe.
``They had the complete package today. They scrapped and played
better.''
</P>
<P>
   No question about it. From the opening 20 minutes, when
Beerbohm, the 6-foot-7-inch junior forward nearly had a
double-double in the first half with 8 points and 10 rebounds, the
Eagles established control of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan made a run in the second half and tied it, 55-55, on a
layup by LaVell Blanchard, who scored a team-high 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bell was fouled on a 3-point attempt and made all three
foul shots, and BC led by at least 3 the rest of the way. The
Eagles' advantage swelled as high as 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a turnaround in a year,'' said DeFilippo. ``From losing
to Harvard, to this.''

BURNS PUZZLED BY ALLISON'S BEHAVIOR

<P>
   BOSTON _ Win one, lose one.
</P>
<P>
   Play inspired some nights, play like dead men skating the next
night.
</P>
<P>
   Score goals one night, can't put the puck in the ocean the next
night.
</P>
<P>
   Show some fight one night, show nothing at all the next night.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Bruins should consult Sherlock Holmes. Maybe he
could unravel the mystery of the team's multiple-personality
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The most disturbing sign of all in Saturday's astonishing 4-0
loss to the Blues in St. Louis is what happened with center Jason
Allison. As recently as last Monday, he said his right forearm felt
great. He hadn't been taking faceoffs, save for a precious few,
until that point, and it was obvious his game suffered as a result.
However, against the Coyotes, he said he was ready, willing, and
healed enough to go back to taking them.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted three games. Then Saturday night, in a contest
against one of the premier teams in the league, Allison couldn't
take them.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said if Allison's availability is tenuous, the
team has to make a decision. Burns made it clear he wants Allison
either to play all facets of the game or sit out until he can. But
Allison is the focal point of the Bruins' offense, and his
inability to do what they expect throws everything off.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't able to take the faceoffs, Allison said he didn't
think he was playing as poorly as his coach did. The fact was,
though, he wasn't the same player. He said taking faceoffs got him
more into the game, got him out on the ice in more situations, and
made him feel an important part of things. That all seemed very
true, particularly against the Coyotes a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Blues, perhaps because he wasn't able to take draws,
Allison was completely ineffective. Burns said he didn't even know
Allison was unable to take the faceoffs until Anson Carter skated
into position. That handcuffed the coach, because he has to have
two other players on the ice who can take draws in case one of them
gets kicked out of the circle.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are too thin at the center position, so to have
Allison unable to participate in such an important facet of the
game is alarming. Not only that, but Allison, one of the most
outgoing players on the team, politely but grimly declined comment
after the game. He did so again Sunday as the team prepared for its
annual family skating party at the FleetCenter. Allison having no
words is like Bill Gates having no money. That indicates something
is definitely wrong.
</P>
<P>
   To add insult to injury, Tim Taylor, the center the Bruins let
walk away for nothing, is the second-leading faceoff man in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   By no means should all the blame be laid at Allison's feet.
There is plenty to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Rob DiMaio was visibly upset after the game, saying it
was the players' fault, and the coaches didn't deserve to take the
heat for this puzzling situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unacceptable,'' he said. ``We, as players, know it,
and we tell each other that between periods that this just can't
happen, but then we go out and do the same thing. It's a shame,
because the coaches know exactly what to say and when to say it and
how to win. We go out and are on our own program some nights, and
it's got to stop. This is nuts. Us, as players, we have to stop
this. It's not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio said they played well for the first few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what happened,'' he said. ``They just turned the game
into a one-sided show and dominated us. We're better than that. We
keep telling ourselves that, but we don't seem to do anything about
it. This has to stop. We play one good game, and then we come back
the next night in a very important game against a very good team
that we should be prepared for, and all the right things are said,
and then we go out and put on a performance like that. I wish I had
the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One answer the team most likely will get shortly is whether
forward Joe Murphy will be sitting out a 10-game suspension for
leaving the bench to jump Blues' left wing Tyson Nash. After
battling with Ray Bourque along the boards, Nash charged Bourque,
and Murphy left the bench to pummel Nash. Leaving the bench to
start or join an altercation carries a multiple-game automatic
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said it was a normal line change, and he doesn't believe
he deserves any supplemental discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything will happen,'' he said. ``(Steve)
Heinze was changing, and I came on and was just involved in the
play. He was coming to the bench to change, and I was up to go and
he was coming off. I came on, and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said he was offended by Nash running Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody can take advantage of our captain,''
said Murphy. ``Ray's our best player, and he plays the most
minutes, and guys can't be taking runs at him. It's not right.
We're a team here, and we have to be all together, sticking up for
each other and going to battle for each other. Guys can't be doing
that to our captain.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy had best be hoping the NHL's dean of disclipine, Colin
Campbell, is in the Christmas spirit. Otherwise, there's big
trouble on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only Bruin who skated prior to the skating party Sunday was
defenseman Mattias Timander. Timander, who is coming off a shoulder
separation, is coming along slowly. It was tough to be out there
alone. ``Yeah,'' joked Timander. ``I'm out here skating with all my
buddies.'' . . . Not so for center Shawn Bates. Bates was sporting
a cast on his left arm that started at his hand and covered his
biceps _ all because of a sprained wrist. ``The doctor felt there
was instability,'' said Bates, ``and he thought this was the way to
correct it. It's a nightmare.''

TIME TO GET BACK TO BASICS FOR CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Five games. Five losses. This was to be a revealing
week for the Celtics, with their first extended foray on the road.
</P>
<P>
   What did they show us? They showed us they miss Paul Pierce. And
they showed they still are a flawed team that can't win on the
road. They played stretches of tantalizing basketball and stretches
of incomprehensible basketball. This past week, it was more of the
latter.
</P>
<P>
   The last defeat, a 100-94 setback Saturday night in Houston,
could well have been an early watershed win. Coming home with a win
after four tough losses, and with an 11-12 record rather than a
10-13 record, would have been much different, especially with the
rest of the month looking equally grim.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 10-13 and with two difficult home games this week (LA
Sunday night, Atlanta Wednesday), the Celtics face the prospect of
sinking even lower. (Their 10 road games are still the fewest in
the conference.) They are still without Pierce (the Celtics are 0-7
in games he has missed), and they need more than white uniforms and
friendly faces to turn it around.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino looked especially exasperated after the Houston
game, sitting on a table in the training room, alone, his tie loose
around his opened white shirt, staring at the final box as if
extended looks might change it.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a young basketball team,'' he said, ``scoring can't
dictate the mentality of how you play this game. That goes for all
12 members. Scoring dictates how they play all other phases of the
game. If they score, they play good defense. They offensive
rebound. Scoring can't dictate how you play this game. It just has
to be a physical battle every possession on defense and has to be a
work of art on offense with passing. Unfortunately, our young
basketball team is not grasping those concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited mental lapses, such as fouling good free-throw shooters
instead of bad ones at the end, or not blocking out to retrieve a
missed free throw. Simple things to a coach. Easy things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not being down or up. It's understanding how to play
basketball,'' he said. ``If you're missing your jump shot, then
offensive rebound. Get to the line. Run the lanes and get a break.
Get a steal. Play all phases of the game of basketball so you're
well-rounded . . . You put all those simple things together.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Celtics didn't do that. They made it hard. Too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up my mind this year I'm not going to get upset at
anything,'' Pitino said after the Houston game, when he was clearly
upset about a lot of things. ``Even this type of basketball is not
going to break me.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of his many concerns:
</P>
<P>
   Team defense: The Rockets were the latest team to exploit the
soft underbelly of the Celtics' half-court defense. Only two teams,
the Nets and the Bulls, are allowing opponents to shoot a higher
percentage. The five teams the Celtics played this week averaged 49
percent shooting; the first three, New York, Utah and Cleveland,
each shot 50 percent or better. The Spurs and Rockets were all
close to 50 percent until they slipped in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Falling behind: At least they didn't blow any leads. But how
hard is it to win when you're on the road and trailing after three
quarters by 12 (New York), 16 (Cleveland), 15 (San Antonio), or 10
(Houston)? Or, to look at it another way, the biggest lead the
Celtics had in any of the five games was 9 points _ early in the
game at New York. In their last four games, the biggest lead the
Celtics had was a 6-pointer at Houston in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Free throws: This figure is somewhat inflated due to deliberate
fouls, but the Celtics allowed an average of 38 free throws a game.
The Celtics shot an average of 23 a game. That's a potential swing
of 15 points. (And with Shaq here Sunday night, that margin is
unlikely to change.) But fouling is one thing. Pitino was mystified
as to why the Celtics fouled 85 percent shooter Cuttino Mobley down
the stretch in Houston when two clangers, Kelvin Cato and Kenny
Thomas, were on the floor. The differential also signals a lack of
aggressiveness at the other end. Once again, the Celtics are below
the 26-a-game average for free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker: Pitino didn't single him out in his post-Houston
rant, but he could have. Walker turned in a 19-minute stink bomb in
the first half, going 1 of 7 and not managing to get a single
rebound. He turned it around with an active, involved second half
(20 points, 7 rebounds). Walker had one excellent game this week
while the other four were classic Walkerian. In those games, he
averaged 16.8 points, 6.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists, and 2.5 turnovers,
and he shot 32 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Rebounds: The Celtics outrebounded the Knicks by 18 and still
lost. When is the last time that happened? The rest of the week,
they were manhandled by every team but Utah. The loss of Danny
Fortson hurts here, but they haven't had him all year and were the
top defensive rebounding team in the league at the start of the
week. Adrian Griffin, a 6-5 swingman, remains their top rebounder.

PREDICTABLY, IT'S QUITTING TIME 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ A top Philadelphia Eagles executive had a
quizzical look on his face in a rather subdued winning locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst any team has played against us in the last
two years,'' he said. ``I've never seen some of our coaches so
confident before the game. They really had a good feeling about
this one.''
</P>
<P>
   What does that say about the Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   The 4-11 Eagles, following their 24-9 victory, were not talking
about how good they were, but about how bad the Patriots were. And
rightly so.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the front seven of the defense, the rest of the
Patriots should have been forced to walk back to Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them not only played badly but gave up for the first
time this season. There were a bunch of guys in New England
uniforms who put out minimal effort, which is a tough way to win a
game in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   For the sixth straight game, the New England offense was
pathetic. In the past, one could make excuses, as the Patriots were
playing against defenses with some muscle.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagles do not have that reputation. Their defense ranks
23d in the league while playing in the NFC East, which has a host a
terrible offensive teams, such at the Giants, Cardinals, and
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   But this normally weak crew dominated the Patriots offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have a fine defensive coordinator, Jim Johnson, who
enjoys a fine reputation. Johnson was with Indianapolis a few years
ago under Ted Marchibroda, and the Colts always gave the Patriots a
hard time.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday Johnson outguessed the Patriots on almost every play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were one step ahead of us almost all the time,'' said
backup quarterback John Friesz. ``There were a lot of times they
brought more guys rushing than we had blocking. There were times
when they gave us a fake look, and then came the other way. One
time we had maximum protection, eight guys protecting, and they
still got through to Drew (Bledsoe) and hit him just as he was
throwing the ball. That was the interception in the end zone when
he was trying to throw to Shawn Jefferson. If he had time, I think
it would have been a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' midseason crash has followed a consistent flight
pattern. They do not score touchdowns in the first half. In fact,
in the first three quarters of their last four games, they have no
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   With the Patriots playing from behind, the opposition knows two
things:
</P>
<P>
   1. New England will stop running the ball.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Patriots will spread the field with three or more wide
receivers looking for a big pass play, leaving Bledsoe vulnerable
to the blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our (offensive philosophy) seems to be that we will give up
the hit on the quarterback trying to make the play,'' said veteran
tackle Bruce Armstrong. ``We see the defense, we set the
protection. We know how to block it. But then they rush six guys
and we have just five blocking, so he (Bledsoe) has to get the ball
out before that open guy gets there or he's going to get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   You could not point the finger at any one person on offense
Sunday. They all had a hand in the self-destruction, with the
exception of Troy Brown, who played so well some of his teammates
should be embarrassed to sit in the same meeting room with him
Monday watching the game films.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe didn't throw well. The blockers didn't block. The
receivers, especially Terry Glenn, dropped passes and made
half-hearted attempts at others.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Patriots played well, with the exception of
free safety Chris Carter. There was some question whether Carter,
who has a sore hamstring, would play at all. He shouldn't have. He
simply didn't have the speed to get to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles had only two big offensive plays all day. Koy Detmer,
the third-string quarterback, threw 50 yards to Torrance Small for
one touchdown, and 44 yards to Dietrich Jells for another. On both
plays, Carter should have been in coverage in the middle of the
field but couldn't help the cornerbacks who thought he was covering
the receivers to the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer completed just 10 of 29 passes for 181 yards. More than
half his yards came on two plays. Yet his team won by 15.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles had just three sacks in their previous four games.
They had six Sunday. Mike Mamula came in with 4 1/2 sacks all year.
He had three Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' offense is suffering from what is called
``overload,'' a blitzing scheme in which the defense puts extra men
to one side of the field and rushes them all. This maneuver has
absolutely been killing the Patriots. They can't handle it. They
can't block it, and Bledsoe and the receivers can't beat it.
</P>
<P>
   The overloading has caused a short circuit, shutting down the
entire Patriot system.
</P>
<P>
   The pregame message on the bulletin board in the Eagles'
defensive locker room was simple.
</P>
<P>
   Physical. Finish.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles were physical, and they finished. And they finished
the Patriots in the process.

BLEDSOE LEFT HELPLESS, HOPELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Apologies were in order, but this time Drew
Bledsoe should have been on the receiving end _ which was more than
could be said for most of his passing targets Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in the wake of a deflating 20-15 loss at Indianapolis,
Bledsoe had issued a mea culpa to Patriots owner Bob Kraft for his
ineffectual performance. Gallant gesture. Disingenuous, too.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, Kraft, his administration and his offense _ with
the notable exception of Troy Brown _ should be begging Bledsoe for
forgiveness for what they've put him through during this season's
second-half nightmare. While the Patriots have been busy turning a
6-2 start into a 7-7 visit to oblivion, the quarterback has served
as the fall guy, both physically and metaphysically, for an offense
that has been as feckless as it has been clueless.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was able to start tending to the rug burns he'd
absorbed on the Veterans Stadium carpet in a 24-9 humiliation by
the supposedly wretched Eagles, Bledsoe knew that not even Santa
Claus could give the Patriots a playoff berth this year.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he probably had more modest Christmas requests in mind,
anyway _ such as survival.
</P>
<P>
   This debacle was a microcosm of the Patriots' demise. Bledsoe
wound up completing only 23 of 49 passes for 331 meaningless yards,
no touchdowns, and four interceptions. The more pertinent
statistics were these: 6 sacks, 14 hurries, 7 knockdowns, and 8
dropped passes, including one in the end zone by Terry Glenn on
fourth and 3 from the Philadelphia 6 with 5:55 left in the fourth
quarter when the Patriots could have made it a one-score game.
</P>
<P>
   This was a true indication of the siege Bledsoe endured all
afternoon as the Eagles' piledriving defense and the Patriots'
passive blockers combined to leave him at constant risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sending nine people,'' said Eagles cornerback Troy
Vincent. ``If you can't get pressure with nine people, there's
something wrong. A lot of times, we were sending more people than
they could block.''
</P>
<P>
   That was gruesomely manifest on two second-quarter plays that
helped take the Patriots out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   New England faced third and goal at the 6 after a 4-yard loss by
Terry Allen when Bledsoe dropped back. And back. And back. Safety
Brian Dawkins burst through the Patriots' line as if it were an
open wound and drove Bledsoe back 19 yards for a sack that forced
New England to settle for a 43-yard Adam Vinatieri field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that pulled the Patriots within 10-6, and they seemed in
golden shape when Allen Rossum fumbled the ensuing kickoff and
Brown covered it at the Eagles 28. From there, Bledsoe went for the
kill but emerged as the victim. Looking for Shawn Jefferson in the
end zone, he was crunched by linebacker William Thomas as he
released the ball, which floated into the hands of Al Harris
downfield and was returned a mere 84 yards to the New England 11.
On the next play, Koy Detmer and Torrance Small showed the Patriots
what a touchdown connection is, and the Eagles were winging away,
17-6.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's later drop in crunch time was merely another statistical
insult for Bledsoe, who again showed he lacks one talent. Pointing
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know what happened to us,'' he said. ``It's not a
good sign, and this has been going on for a while. (The game) was
certainly one to forget. If we could have taken away those three
turnovers in the first half and the points off the board, we would
have been right in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe well knows there are no givebacks in the NFL, just
giveaways _ of which the Patriots totaled seven. In other words, it
was business as usual for them, though they won't have a chance to
employ it much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're done,'' said Bledsoe. ``Obviously, it's hard to put
into words how disheartening this is. We were playing from behind.
They blitzed us the entire game, and we just weren't prepared for
it. I don't have the answer for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes he does.
</P>
<P>
   He's just too classy _ or shellshocked _ to acknowledge it.

DETMER MANAGES PASSING GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ All day long, it seemed, his passes were hitting
either paydirt or dirt. There was no happy medium for Eagles
quarterback Koy Detmer, no semblance of consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, that was perfectly understandable, because there was
no frame of reference, either.
</P>
<P>
   A bona fide journeyman, Detmer had spent the first 14 games of
the season entrenched as the Eagles' third-string quarterback. The
disaster quarterback, in NFL parlance.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of disasters, he had watched the two men ahead of him
in the pecking order, Doug Pederson and No. 2 overall draft choice
Donovan McNabb, guide Philadelphia to a 3-11 record. And since both
were sidelined for Sunday's game against the Patriots at Veterans
Stadium, disaster became calamity as Detmer became, for all intents
and purposes, the one and only quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen no action since the first exhibition game _ and no
official action since he started the last five games of the 1998
season _ Detmer was admittedly covered with rust, as reflected in
his final numbers: 10 for 29, 181 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to an even more inexperienced New England secondary,
he also found his receivers uncovered often enough that his
performance had to be adjudged a success, as reflected in these
final numbers: Eagles 24, Patriots 9.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Detmer wound up enjoying a career day. Granted, it's
been a modest career for the three-year veteran from the University
of Colorado, but three touchdown passes _ 50 and 11 yards to
Torrance Small and 44 yards to Patriots castoff Dietrich Jells _
were nothing to sneeze at.
</P>
<P>
   ``Koy came out and rose to the occasion,'' said Eagles coach
Andy Reid, ignoring the fact that the New England offense (seven
turnovers) sank to the occasion, allowing the Philadelphia defense
to hand Detmer prime opportunities all day. ``He did a nice job.
He'd be the first to tell you he was inconsistent, but that's to be
expected in a situation where he's had so few reps.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patriots cornerbacks Kato Serwanga and Tebucky Jones had
even fewer reps before they were shoved off the bench to replace
injured starters Steve Israel and Ty Law.
</P>
<P>
   And Detmer took advantage to find Small on a corner post pattern
from midfield on which Serwanga got lost in a zone defense in the
first quarter. Just when the Patriots seemed to be threatening,
pulling within 10-6 in the second quarter, Detmer hit Small on a
crossing pattern on which the receiver made a one-handed catch for
the score and a 17-6 halftime spread. Both plays came immediately
after the Philadelphia defense bequeathed the ball to Detmer in
scoring territory with interceptions of beleaguered Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man-to-man, we knew they had some new corners,'' said Detmer,
``and we wanted to take a shot at them, see what they could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much, as Jones proved with 1:08 left in the third quarter
when he was left flatfooted at the line of scrimmage by Jells, who
hauled in a Detmer strike over the middle and slanted into the end
zone for the coup de grace.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer, an excitable boy whose celebratory histrionics had
prompted criticism last year, commemorated his highest TD output
ever with a dance in front of the Eagles bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a high-energy kind of guy,'' said Reid, who had cautioned
Detmer to tone it down _ on the off chance he had something to
revel in _ before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about all that stuff,'' said Detmer. ``The main deal
was he didn't want it to be overzealous. He knows I like to be
emotional out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That was obvious earlier in the third quarter when Detmer rolled
and writhed in seeming agony after taking a straight-on shot from
Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi. Observers were counting Detmer's
body parts when he was finally helped off the field, but after a
one-play hiatus in favor of Pederson, he was back in the huddle.
The grave diagnosis: The wind had been knocked out of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you're going to be all right,'' said Detmer, ``but
your family and everybody are worried. You feel like a sissy,
flailing around like that when there's really nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Flailing also described his performance for much of the
afternoon. ``It was one of those games when I was up and down,''
said Detmer, speaking figuratively despite the Bruschi smash.
``Offensively, we didn't play terrible and we didn't play great.''
</P>
<P>
   Which qualified as a smashing success against the obliging
Patriots.

MIAMI'S REVERSAL OF MISFORTUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ This was the wild and woolly week that was for the Miami
Dolphins:
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Miami suffered its third consecutive loss in a
horrendous setback, 28-20, to the host New York Jets. Coach Jimmy
Johnson criticized quarterback Dan Marino for not taking better
care of the football. Then the Dolphins' anemic running game was
dealt another blow when Cecil Collins, a recalcitrant rookie
running back on the mend after breaking his left leg Nov. 14, was
arrested on two counts of burglary for breaking into a woman's
apartment early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth-round draft choice who had run afoul of the law at
McNeese State and Louisiana State, Collins was released on $10,000
bail and placed on the inactive list, but he was arrested again
Friday for extradition to Louisiana, where he is expected to face
parole violations.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, troubled rookie defensive lineman Dimitrius
Underwood _ who survived an apparent suicide attempt three months
ago in East Lansing, Mich. _ was reported missing from a
psychiatric care facility into which he had voluntarily admitted
himself in nearby Sunrise, Fla. Underwood showed up at the Dolphins
training complex, met with Johnson, and was released from the team.
</P>
<P>
   So how did the Dolphins cap off the week?
</P>
<P>
   Miami engaged the San Diego Chargers in a tractor pull between
red zone-challenged offenses Sunday and snapped its three-game
losing skid with a redemptive 12-9 victory before a Pro Player
Stadium crowd of 73,765. The game, however, wasn't decided until
San Diego kicker John Carney bounced a game-tying 36-yard field
goal attempt off the left upright with 10 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins (9-5) got all 12 of their points on field goals by
Olindo Mare, who converted kicks of 32, 21, 30, and 31 yards, the
last coming off a Rich Owens forced fumble and Brock Marion
recovery that enabled Miami to break a 9-9 tie with 3:22 left in
the game. Mare, as a result, established a club scoring record with
133 points and tied the NFL single-season record for field goals
with 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the game, and that's what matters,'' Mare said.
``There's more pressure in kicking a field goal to try to break a
tie for the win than there is trying to break a record.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Miami won a game without scoring a touchdown was
last Oct. 25 in a 12-9 victory over the Patriots. But when Carney,
who converted kicks of 23, 22, and 31 yards, lined up for his
fourth and final attempt, Mare was so certain it would be good he
began warming up for overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a quick story for you,'' Mare said. ``I went to kick
with Carney out in San Diego with a group of guys (during the
offseason) . . . And we kicked out there and kind of goofed around
and had a little competition. Carney was probably about 35 yards
away from a telephone pole, and we just sat back there and said,
`First one to hit it wins.' He went first and hit it, and I never
got to kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a year ago, and I'm thinking this guy's a real
professional and I'm just a kid trying to learn,'' he added.
``Believe it or not, it helps you out with little things watching
something like that. But you never even consider or think of
something like that when it happens. You just feel for the guy. I
probably feel for him more than anybody in here, but I'm happy to
win a game, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Miami's offense had to settle for field goals on four
red-zone opportunities, there were no arrests afterward. Johnson
released no players. And for the time being, there was no whining
on the airwaves about Jimmy and Danny and Danny and Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the distracting events of the past week, Marino, who
completed 22 of 36 passes for 241 yards, chose to skirt the issue
during his postgame press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What events?'' was Marino's sharp retort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it was like a soap opera, man,'' admitted linebacker
Zach Thomas. ``You can get caught up in those distractions. You
know, everything happened this week. I'm so glad that we got that
out of our heads, because it can hurt you as a team. The Dolphins
are here to play football and not to (generate) all this negative
publicity. It can bring down your whole organization . . . It was
great to win again. It tops everything, and hopefully we can get on
a roll and get a little confidence.''

LAKERS BEAT RAPTORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ So much seemed familiar Sunday as the Los Angeles
Lakers dueled the Toronto Raptors _ and that wasn't necessarily a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Lakers frittered away a huge lead.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, they ditched a methodical offense in favor of
too-fancy or too-rushed plays that turned into fast breaks in the
other direction.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, there were thinly veiled jabs at the Lakers' eager
young superstar for failing to stick to the game plan.
</P>
<P>
   But then, no one was complaining too loudly about any of it
because the most familiar sight of all Sunday afternoon was a
Lakers victory, 94-88 over the Raptors at the sold-out Air Canada
Centre.
</P>
<P>
   That's six wins in a row, 13 in the past 14 games and a 3-0
record on the road trip that concludes today in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased, we're very pleased,'' coach Phil Jackson said,
without sounding the part.
</P>
<P>
   Locker-room hand-wringing overshadowed any sense of
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: a 19-point, third-quarter lead that was chopped to
four points by the final minute of play _ caused in part, but not
solely, by Kobe Bryant's wildness with the ball as he tried to
outduel fellow phenom Vince Carter.
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar issue, one Jackson discussed at length with
Bryant on Saturday during a long wait at Canadian Customs at the
Toronto Airport.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be discussed again. Though Bryant led the Lakers
with 26 points, he was 1 for 5 with a turnover in the final 10
minutes. That _ along with turnovers by Ron Harper and Rick Fox and
1-for-5 shooting by Shaquille O'Neal _ contributed to a breakdown
in the offense and 14 fast-break points for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with Kobe's effort for the first three
quarters,'' Jackson said. ``I thought that he felt like he had to
do something special at the end of the game.... It wasn't
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant admitted to getting a little caught up in a tit-for-tat
circus act with Carter, forgetting for a time the lecture Jackson
delivered 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick your spots,'' Jackson recalled telling him. ``Know the
whole team aspect rather than the individual aspect of what the
game situation is, the clock situation is. Look for your
opportunities to run, but then don't force it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant agreed with the sentiment, both before and after the
game. It was during that caused problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers took a 17-point lead into the fourth, having held the
Raptors to 35-percent shooting through three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   It was 81-66 with 7:23 to go. But Fox lost the ball on one
possession and missed a shot on the next. Then Bryant missed. Then
he tried to dunk between Davis and Kevin Willlis but got the foul
and hit his free throws.
</P>
<P>
   But then Bryant missed another long jumper (Carter dunked at the
other end). Fox bricked from 3-point range (Muggsy Bogues hit a
jumper). Harper traveled. Tracy McGrady stripped Bryant in the key.
O'Neal missed three of four free throws. Davis blocked Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's free throws made it 84-80 with 1:23 left. Bryant atoned
with a jumper, and the Raptors turned to fouling (with O'Neal
safely on the bench). The Lakers survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some times a couple players got carried away out
there,'' Harper said without naming names. ``They start doing their
own thing, they get out there, dribbling the ball in between their
legs and doing their own thing. There's a time for that. There's a
time we need to learn, we need to sit down and play basketball and
put a team down and just hold them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said his chat with Jackson was positive, and said he
understands the need to show restraint. ``Oh, absolutely,'' he
said. ``I mean, there's no question about it. The better I get at
it, the better we get at it, the better we're going to be at key
situations during the contest. I'm going to get better at it, no
question....
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get caught up in a one-on-one competition,
especially against this team, but my job on this team is to dissect
them, and find out which way we need to go in certain situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense again revolved around Glen Rice (22 points), Bryant
and O'Neal (24 points), but O'Neal was stewing about the final 12
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we wore down, it's that we were taking
ill-advised shots,'' he said. A problem that needed to be fixed?
``I guess.'' And was it being fixed? ``I guess. I have no idea.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Once again, the Boston College women's basketball team
rolled over its opponents. And once again, the Eagles brought in
all 12 of their players as they trounced Northwestern, 86-55,
Sunday before 731 at Conte Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Five BC players scored in double figures, but it was senior
point guard Cal Bouchard who led the charge as she racked up a
season-high 25 points, including a perfect 5 of 5 from behind the
3-point line and 6 of 6 from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   BC improved its record to 8-3, while Northwestern, which has now
lost four games in a row, fell to 2-6.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was similar to BC's 88-52 blowout over Dartmouth
last Sunday, although it looked as if BC would have a harder time
against the Big Ten team when the Wildcats marched out to a 7-4
lead and the Eagles missed their first four shots. But then BC went
on an 11-2 run to give the Eagles a 15-9 gap and a lead they would
never relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   BC, which finished with 11 steals to Northwestern's four, had a
play worthy of a highlight film in the first half. Kim Mackie, BC's
6-foot-3-inch forward, harassed Northwestern's Tami Sears as she
threw an inbound ball. Mackie intercepted the pass and threw the
ball to BC forward Alissa Murphy, who fed it to Bouchard, who
connected for a 3-pointer to put the Eagles up by 11, 27-16.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats refused to let the Eagles have the last word,
though, and at 3:41 in the half, they went on an 11-2 run of their
own to close the gap to 30-27. But Mackie drove for a layup as the
clock wound down, and BC took a 32-27 lead at the intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had a little bit of a mental breakdown, and we had
to make some adjustments,'' said BC coach Cathy Inglese.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was to have Bouchard take over the point guard
spot, which Brianne Stepherson (11 points) had assumed until she
went to the bench with four personal fouls at 15:11 in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved to point, and I think that freed me up to make more
shots,'' said Bouchard, who hit 14 in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when the Eagles came back after the break, they made the
first half look like a dry run and went on a 21-6 tear that put
them up by 20 at 53-33.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern coach June Olkowski said she wasn't surprised by
BC's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston College has the outside-inside punch, and they have the
attitude,'' she said. ``There is no self-doubt, there is no team
doubt, and when you have that and good coaching, you have the
winning combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern forward Leslie Schock finished with a team-high 15
points.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy added 11 points for the Eagles, and center Jamie
Cournoyer contributed 10, but the real surprise was 5-11 shooting
guard Nicole Conway, who had been averaging 13 minutes and 2.5
points a game this year. She finished with 24 minutes and a
season-high 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Conway saw a lot of action last year when Bouchard was
sidelined, and she admitted she's had to adjust to getting reduced
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working hard to get myself back to where I was last
year, confidence-wise,'' said Conway. ``But after I hit my first
two shots, I just went from there.''

MIGHTY DUCKS BEAT RED WINGS
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Mighty Ducks' Teemu Selanne says,
``When the steel is hot, you have to use the hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Ducks are hot and Sunday evening they used the
hammer on the Detroit Red Wings, a team that has pounded them into
submission over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings flew into Orange County with the best record in
the league this season and a record of 24-4-5 over the Ducks,
including two four-game sweeps in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the Red Wings were no match for the Ducks, who
extended their winning streak to four games with an impressive 3-1
victory before 16,538 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   There were the usual large numbers of Detroit fans in the crowd,
but they were silenced early when Jim McKenzie batted home a
rebound at 3:48 of the opening period. And when McKenzie's screen
and Marty McInnis' centering pass led to Matt Cullen's first goal
in 15 games at 12:45, the Red Wings were all but out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to take it to them,'' said McKenzie of the quick
start that earned the Ducks a commanding first-period lead even
though the No. 1 line was held without a shot. ``We were playing
the best team in the league and we didn't want to sit back and
watch if we were going to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows us how we have to play against the good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg was in complete agreement with his
big winger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried that trick before and paid the price,'' said
Hartsburg, referring to slow starts. ``You don't want to play them
from behind. We worked hard and worked for 60 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks matched a franchise best at four games over .500 with
the victory and moved into a tie with the Kings and Dallas in the
Pacific Division standings.
</P>
<P>
   When Anaheim played in Detroit earlier this season, the Ducks
allowed three power-play goals in a 6-3 loss, but Sunday they won
the battle of the special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kariya all but iced the game with a power-play goal at
10:13 of the second period and the penalty unit killed off five
Detroit power plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were embarrassed by that in Detroit,'' Hartsburg said.
``But we have bounced back since then and did a great job
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have allowed only six power-play goals in the 14 games
since the Detroit debacle.

MURRAY ON A STAR SEARCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three games, 23 goals-against and three losses
have brought questions about whether this Los Angeles Kings team is
any different than years past.
</P>
<P>
   It's also brought rookie coach Andy Murray his first full-blown
crisis, and Murray is leaning on the Kings' stars to pull the team
out of a disastrous funk.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Kings practiced Sunday at Staples Center, Murray
pulled Rob Blake, Garry Galley, Sean O'Donnell and Luc Robitaille
in for individual meetings to discuss the psyche and direction of
the club. After practice, Murray spoke with the remaining players
individually.
</P>
<P>
   Murray challenged the Kings' marquee players _ primarily Blake,
Robitaille, Ziggy Palffy and goalie Stephane Fiset _ to carry the
Kings out of this three-game slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trusting each other,'' Murray said. ``It's the way
we've lost them that's been alarming for us. We think our system of
play execution has been our first problem, and trusting each other
in that system of play. The second point is that our key players
have to play good. It's difficult for our other players, who are
role players, to be effective if our key players are not playing
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third thing is we've taken a lot of pride to be tough to
play against. We're not being tough to play against right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings still have two more days of practice before playing
Wednesday at San Jose, but fundamental breakdowns in forechecking
and defensive zone coverage resulted in losses to New Jersey (7-1),
the New York Rangers (8-3) and Chicago (8-4).
</P>
<P>
   In those games, the Kings were outscored 13-1 in the first
period. It's in direct contrast to the first 30 games, in which the
Kings started strong and went 16-8-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the system that's letting us down, it's the
players,'' Blake said. ``Our game against San Jose is magnified
way, way more than if we would have won those three games. You have
to be able to stop it. In the past we haven't stopped it, and
that's what killed us during seasons. You work that hard for 30
games, you don't want to let that slip. We let it slip far enough
in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let it slip anymore. That's why there's meetings and
that's why there are practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel return?: After skating on the Kings' first line with
Robitaille and Vladimir Tsyplakov during practice, center Jozef
Stumpel said he expected to play against San Jose. Stumpel has been
out since Nov. 4 because of sports hernia surgery. He was supposed
to miss eight to 10 weeks but has worked his way back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel maybe I need to get a little more in game shape, but
the only way to do that is to play games,'' Stumpel said. ``Maybe
the first game I'll be great and then struggle for a couple.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: At 12:01 this morning, rosters froze for a week, so the
Kings met into the evening to discuss their plan. They are expected
to announce they have placed Galley (post-concussion syndrome) on
injured reserve and sent Dan Bylsma to Long Beach of the IHL. They
are expected to activate Stumpel and add tough-guy Bill Huard, who
is at Lowell of the AHL.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Palffy (back) and Jason Blake (post-concussion
syndrome) both received treatment rather skating in practice.

JORDAN HEIRS IN WAITING STRUT THEIR STUFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The game within the game Sunday was, in a manner of
speaking, the Battle of the Heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers and Vince Carter of the
Toronto Raptors, both young, athletic, superbly gifted, versatile
and charismatic, both possible heirs to Michael Jordan went head to
head for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout-shortened schedule prevented a meeting last season,
Carter's first in the NBA. Bryant's broken hand prevented a matchup
in November. When they finally did go head to head, it was hardly
by design.
</P>
<P>
   Carter plays small forward, not shooting guard, and Lakers coach
Phil Jackson didn't intend for Bryant to guard him as much as he
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kobe just gravitated over there,'' Jackson said. ``I
wanted to go with Kobe on Carter at one point in the ballgame, and
I did make that change. I think Kobe liked the challenge and took
it (further).''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's team won behind his 26 points on 9-for-20 shooting.
Carter scored a game-high 29 on 11-for-28 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The smack talk was a draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit his shot and I'd say, `Aw that was a B.S. shot, and I
come down and hit a shot and he says, `Aw, that was a B.S. shot,''
Bryant said. ``We just go back and forth, just talk and have a good
time. ... Definitely, you like to talk a litle bit. Him, J.R.
(Rider) and a couple other guys that I know and I'm familiar with,
I like to talk to them sometimes. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just pure competition, that's all. I wanted to see what
he got, I'm sure he wanted to see what I got. Just playing him,
denying him the basketball, making him do something else. It was
just fun. I mean, we're going to be in this league for a long, long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was asked what Carter brings to the court. ``He's got
some game.'' And Bryant? ``I got a lot of game.''
</P>
<P>
   Weary: The Raptors' late charge Sunday prevented Jackson from
resting his starters, and the Lakers showed some signs of fatigue
after playing their third game in four nights. But they can sweep
the road trip with a win over the Boston Celtics tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of got the idea of playing well together on the road
and feel confident about what we're doing,'' Jackson said. ``It's
just that right now we're playing a little bit in fits and spurts
and we've got to get a little more smooth in our overall game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics, though sub-.500, present a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that's going to be a pressing, trapping, up-tempo
(team), and we're going to have to be very strong,'' he said.

CONSIDERING PARITY IN THE NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's parity-free edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   To the NFL, parity is a good thing. To many fans, it should be
one of comedian George Carlin's seven nasty words.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of an upside-down NFL was kind of cool at
mid-season. Didn't we all snicker at a thought of a Rams-Colts
Super Bowl showdown? But now that December is here, that matchup
may be the best prospect, and the only thing inspiring laughter are
the playoff dreams of bluebloods like the Cowboys and Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Teams like the Cowboys, Redskins, Dolphins and Seahawks are
still alive according to the league's coroners, but they are merely
postponing the inevitable. Anyone believing the Dolphins are on
track for a Dan Marino Super Bowl appearance has been watching
``Ace Ventura'' too much. ...
</P>
<P>
   Here's how things will likely shake out:
</P>
<P>
   AFC: Indy (12-2, East), Jacksonville (13-1, Central) and
Tennessee (11-3, wild card) are in. Buffalo and Miami, both 9-5,
look safe as wild cards. That leaves Kansas City (9-5) and Seattle
(8-6) to settle the west next week.
</P>
<P>
   Caveats to this: Miami, the worst 9-5 team ever, has to play the
Jets this week and Washington next. Buffalo has the Colts in their
finale. Seattle holds a tiebreaker edge if they tie with K.C.
Tennessee- Jacksonville play for show this week. K.C. shouldn't
test fate with a finale scheduled against the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   NFC: St. Louis (12-2, West) is on the pole. If this was the
Kentucky Derby, everyone else would be a field horse.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (9-5, Central) controls its fate, but has the Packers
and Bears left. The Lions (8-6) are hanging on, but have the
Broncos and Vikes left. The Packers (7-6) need tonight's game more
than the Vikings (7-6), since the Vikes should win their last two
(Giants, Lions left.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the NFC East is the Big West of pro football.
Washington (8-6, East) has the 49ers and Dolphins left. A split
won't win them the division if Dallas (7-7, Saints and Giants) wins
out, but it would be enough if the Giants win out (Vikes, Cowboys).
Carolina (7-7) should finish 9-7 with the Steelers and Saints left,
but most of the tiebreakers work against them. They need several
teams to fall apart. ...
</P>
<P>
   Ruminations after 15 weeks:
</P>
<P>
   Miami is the worst 9-5 team ever, and they're also schizoid. Six
of their nine wins have been by a touchdown or less. They've scored
30 points or more four times, but 17 points or less in six of their
last nine games. Jimmy Johnson was warned before taking the job
that he and Marino couldn't co-exist, and the '99 season proves it.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore has won five of its last seven, and the two losses
were to the Jags. They started their run too late to earn a playoff
spot, but they're definitely a team to watch in '00. Think
Cleveland regrets not hiring Brian Bilick? The Ravens coach is
winning with Tony Banks.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams may be this season's version of NFL serendipity. More
than one person close to the organization confides that the players
were split over Dick Vermeil at the beginning of the season, and
that no one had a clue Kurt Warner would play like this.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and Steve Beuerlein are Exhibits 1 and 1-A in the case for
keeping veteran quarterbacks handy. And I guess Jon Kitna isn't the
new Brett Favre, either.
</P>
<P>
   Al Davis would be crazy to fire Jon Gruden, which is a rumor
around the league. The '99 Raiders haven't been able to finish
games, but Gruden has the team playing hard and with better
fundamentals in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who was around the Raiders when Gunther Cunningham
was defensive coordinator isn't shocked to see the Chiefs where
they are. Cunningham is as tough as he is bright, and he sold the
Chiefs on his macho philosophy. The only hedge is that macho
tactics often have a short lifespan. ...
</P>
<P>
   I have less of a problem with UCLA getting soundly beat by
Gonzaga than the Bruins putting the Morgan State's of the
basketball world on their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Games like those are of little value to anyone. Where's the
test? It's impossible to judge a team's progress against an
outclassed opponent like that. All it did was fed the ego of Steve
Lavin's young team and create an unreasonable expectation once they
met a good team, like Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   The DePaul win was a good win. But the Bruins haven't shown
anything that makes one believe they can beat Stanford and Arizona.
This team is a year older, but it still plays young. ...
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Jason Kapono will be a force this year, and the Bruins
depth will improve once JaRon Rush and Matt Barnes get cleared to
play. But center Dan Gadzuric will define the Bruins' success. If
he's healthy and plays strong inside, the Bruins can play deep into
the tournament. ...
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Morgan's 49ers are never going to play pretty basketball,
but then there's not a whole lot of beauty in the sport these days.
Basketball has become a tug-o-war; he who holds tightest and grunts
the loudest wins.
</P>
<P>
   The win over USC came on the backs of the 49ers stubborn inside
game -- Mate Milisa is looking like a first-round NBA pick, and
James Williams has been a great addition -- and Morgan's good
fortune in having a fleet of guards to rotate and wear down
opponents. ...
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the Final Four a year after saying goodbye to Misty
May almost says more about the state of Brian Gimmillaro's program
than any of their three national titles. The 49ers never rebuild,
they just reload. ...
</P>
<P>
   Today's question du jour: The only endeavor in which screaming
is considered an effective tool is in the military. So why do so
many basketball coaches scream at the top of their lungs? It can't
always because of the din of the crowd, because I see coaches
scream in huddles.
</P>
<P>
   I can't ever remember hearing John Wooden, Red Auerbach or Bill
Sherman scream during a game. ...

KINGS HAVE HIT A ROAD BLOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 30 games the script was perfect. An embattled hockey team
moves into a state-of-art arena and is reborn. Instead of being the
butt of jokes, it becomes the talk of the town. The more it plays
the more it convinces people it's for real.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the Kings led the NHL in points, and despite the
loss of Luc Robitaille, Jozef Stumpel and Stephane Fiset for
extended periods of time they were still riding high in the Pacific
Division and Western Conference standings as recently as six days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Murray was a leading coach of the year contender, Rob Blake
was being touted for his second Norris Trophy and Zigmund Palffy --
well, maybe he wasn't Wayne Gretzky, but to Los Angeles'
star-starved fans he was close.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, however, the positives seem like distant memories
after a disastrous three-game stretch that made one realize that
the Kings are still the franchise that probably lost a Stanley Cup
title because of an illegal stick, made an artform of trading away
high draft choices that other teams turned into stars, and one that
had only 11 .500 or better finishes in its first 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings took their league-leading road show -- they still have
the NHL's best road record -- to the New York area last week and
their act was off off-Broadway in less than 48 hours as they were
routed by good New Jersey team, 7-1, on Tuesday and then humilated
by a bad Rangers team, 8-3, a night later.
</P>
<P>
   And just when when it didn't seem like it could get any worse,
they brought their pathetic act back home and were embarrassed by
Chicago, 8-4, in front of a sellout crowd at Staples Center on
Saturday. The same Blackhawks team that barely managed a scoring
chance in a 2-0 loss to the Mighty Ducks on Friday, a Chicago team
that had only 22 points (third worst in the league) heading into
the game.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a shocking turn of events for a team that looked
poised to turn things up a notch with the return of Blake, Palffy,
Robitaille and Fiset to the lineup. Losing three games in a row is
one thing, but not being competitive is another, especially for a
team that had outscored its opponets 95-73 in the first 30 games.
</P>
<P>
   It's even harder to understand when one realizes the Kings
haven't been playing the NHL's offensive elite. No, it hasn't been
Jaromir Jagr, Teemu Selanne, Paul Kariya, Eric Lindros and Pavel
Bure who have been lighting the lamp. No, it has been guys like
Todd Harvey (3 goals this season), John MacLean (3), Kevin Stevens
(3), Jean-Pierre Dumont (7), Doug Zmolek (2) and Dave Manson (1)
who have seemingly destroyed the Kings' confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who admits his team has ``reached rock bottom'' now
faces his biggest challenge yet -- restoring the confidence of a
team that looked shaken to the core Saturday night. Three games
certainly don't make or break a season, but three embarrassing
losses can send a team into a downward spiral that take a long,
long time to pull out of. And no team in the Western Conference can
afford an extended slump, especially one that has qualified for
postseason play only once in the last six seasons. &QL; 
--
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, down in Orange County the Ducks are very slowly, but
surely, beginning to believe they might be more than just a .500
team. Heading into Sunday's game with old nemsis Detroit the Ducks
were three games over .500 and spirits were high among a group that
at times had looked surprisingly uninspired this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our ups and downs this season, but the rewards are
starting to come,'' said Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg, who has
defended his team all along, saying it was going through a learning
process. ``We know we are on the right track and the guys are
excited about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are having a lot more fun that six weeks ago and we just
have to keep plugging away, keep progressing.''
</P>
<P>
   One area in which the Ducks have certainly progressed in is
defense. Anaheim came into Sunday's game as the NHL's third best
defensive team, allowing (2.18 goals a game).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of Selanne and Kariya the Ducks don't score
a lot (2.5 goals a game), but Hartsburg has convinced even his
biggest stars that they must play both ends of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to play the way Craig wants us to play and
that's why we are having success,'' said Kariya, who was second in
the league with a plus-21 rating going into the Detroit game.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne, who scored 76 goals as a rookie, hasn't been a scoring
machine this season (14 goals going into Sunday's game), but he was
among the league leaders as well with a plus-17 rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should always win when we limit teams to two goals or
less,'' said Selanne. ``We are playing smart defensively and our
line has to be the example.''
</P>
<P>
   The third member of the Ducks' No. 1 line is also doing a lot of
little things right. Steve Rucchin was plus-12 and leads the league
in faceoffs won.'' &QL; 
--
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that Jagr is most talented player in the
NHL. His totals of 25 goals and 53 points in 29 games speak for
themselves. But you can't help but wonder about his priorities
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr recently won the war with former coach Kevin Constantine
when owner Mario Lemieux and GM Craig Patrick fired the man who
somehow kept the Penguins together, and more than competitive, the
last two seasons as the franchise struggled through bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr, it seems, wasn't happy with the defensive-minded system
that Constantine used, and he was more than willing to air his
opinions in public.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting their meal ticket to be unhappy, Pittsburg hired
Herb Brooks, he of ``Miracle of Ice'' fame. The former U.S. Olympic
coach may employ the wide-open system that Jagr favors, but don't
expect any miracles in Pittsburgh come playoff time. Like it or
not, teams have to play defense to win Stanley Cup championships
these days.

DUCKS QUICK TO COME TO EACH OTHER'S DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Paul Kariya and Chris Chelios, buddies from
Chelios' days in Chicago, got together several times in Sunday's
game. This time it was the Ducks captain who seemed to get under
the Detroit defenseman's skin.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who is more and more to defend himself, appeared to get
away with a high stick in the second period and Chelios responded
by taking a roughing penalty. At the end of the period the two went
at it again lios took a run at Kariya and put a hard, clean
check on him. But the Ducks quickly came to Kariya's aid and
Chelios and Jason Marshall were both assessed 10-minute misconducts
following the scrum that once again involved Teemu Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne and the rest of the Ducks are very quick to come each
other's defense these days, no matter who is involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend a lot of time together and we are becoming a very
close-knit team,'' said Kariya. ``Not every team has to be close to
be successful, but when you care about the guy next to you, you
want to play hard for them.'' &QL; 
--
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have avoided major injuries to their so-called core
players. Among the group of Selanne, Kariya, Guy Hebert, Steve
Rucchin and Oleg Tverdovsky, only Kariya (1) and Selanne (3) have
missed time due to injury.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks' role players have been hit hard with injuries and
suspensions and it has tested Anaheim's questionable depth.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim went into Sunday's game minus forwards Antti Aalto and
Mike Leclerc and defensemen Pavel Trnka and Pascal Trepanier. Aalto
has missed six games with a strained elbow and isn't expected back
until after New Year's. Leclerc, who had elbow surgery and missed
12 games earlier this season, reaggravated the elbow last Friday
and is out idefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Trepanier suffered a concussion Friday when his head hit the ice
after running into Chicago's Tony Amonte. Trnka is close to
returning, but he has missed the last five games with a groin
strain.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Kevin Haller and forward Jim McKenzie are back, but
both have missed considerable time. Haller has missed 13 games due
to knee problems and McKenzie was out nine games with a broken hand
and also served a four-game suspension early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Trepanier has missed four games due to suspension and Ruslan
Salei was suspended for 10 games. &QL; 
--
</P>
<P>
   Marty McInnis, like the most of the Ducks, has had his share of
ups and downs, but like the rest of the team he has been on the
upswing recently.
</P>
<P>
   The winger had a career-high three assists in Sunday's game and
has seven points in seven games after having only two in the
previous 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim power play came into the game ranked 26th in the
league, but like the team it's getting better. Kariya's power play
goal in the second period extended the unit's scoring streak to a
season-high four games. &QL;

 ANALYSIS: ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL, GAYS STILL VIEWED AS LIABILITIES  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is the best and worst of times for gay politics
on the presidential campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   For all their softened rhetoric on homosexuality, Republican
presidential candidates remain opposed to virtually every piece of
legislation important to gay groups. Democrats, who are openly
jostling for gay support, refuse to even consider the notion of
same-sex marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy for advocates of gay causes to get lost in their
successes. Everyone agrees that this field of presidential
aspirants accepts gays more than ever before and that gay issues
have assumed a more prominent role than in any previous
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the limits to what politicians will support
have never been more noticeable. The concerns are especially acute
in regard to the Republican field, where no candidate endorses
basic gay causes, such as a ban on job discrimination or passage of
a hate-crimes law. But even the Democrats appear fearful of too
tight an embrace with a group that has been ostracized for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rhetoric has become more benign, but the serpents are live
and well below the surface,'' warned Elizabeth Birch, executive
director of Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay
lobbying group, quickly adding that her greatest fears involve GOP
front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic issues that affect gays and lesbians have moved like
a rocket ship in this decade ... but we still have a long ways to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the issue was the military's policy of permitting
homosexuals to serve as long as they do not disclose their
sexuality. Vice President Al Gore, following the lead of first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, characterized President Clinton's ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy as a failure and called for its
elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve their country
without discrimination,'' Gore said, as campaign aides e-mailed
news clippings to reporters showing that the vice president has
opposed the policy all along.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, like his Democratic rival Bill Bradley, believes that
while the military should be open to gays, marriage should not.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; A Different Category
</P>
<P>
   The vice president ``supports domestic partnerships, (but) we
don't think they should be put in the same category as traditional
marriages,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who speaks passionately on the stump about ending
discrimination against gays, agrees that the line should be drawn
at marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just been my view that there is a sufficient body of
religious opinion that marriage is a sacrament,'' Bradley explained
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The position rankles some gay leaders, who understand the
political necessity of opposing gay marriage but see no
intellectual honesty to their argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take a very courageous politician to lead the way,''
said Rebecca Isaacs, political director for the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force. ``We don't have that person yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Isaacs and other gay leaders say there is a world
of difference between Democrats _ who support domestic
partnerships, hate-crimes legislation, more AIDS funding and
federal protection against job discrimination _ and Republicans,
whose party has a legacy of hostility toward gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the perception eight, even four years ago, was that
you could gay bash and that it would be a plus. I don't think
that's working today,'' said Rich Tafel, executive director of the
gay Log Cabin Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best illustration of the low expectations for
Republicans among some gay groups is the almost gushing support for
Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain impressed some gays for his successful efforts in the
Senate to kill legislation sponsored by former Orange County Rep.
Bob Dornan that would have forced anyone with AIDS out of the
military. He also has stood up for openly gay staff members and
endorsed gay candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain rejects nearly all of the legislative proposals
advocated by gay leaders. His biggest difference with Bush is
simply his willingness to sit down and talk with gay Republicans
and ask for their support, despite his refusal to endorse their
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am unashamed, unembarrassed and proud to work with you,`
McCain told the group, according to participants in the meeting
that was held last month.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told the group that he would work to eliminate prejudice,
but when asked the next week by a reporter how he would do so, he
provided few details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to enforce existing laws and pursue programs (to
eliminate discrimination),'' he said. ``I also think the president
can use his bully pulpit to appeal to our better angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush prompted an angry response from gays for his refusal to
meet with the Log Cabin Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a person's sexual orientation is their personal
business and should not be politicized,'' Bush explained earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why then he agreed to meet with a Jewish Republican group
days before, he hardly budged from his original answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meant to say personal and private,'' Bush said. ``It's
private as far as I'm concerned. I don't want to politicize
someone's private life.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Mixed Signals
</P>
<P>
   Gay critics point with alarm to Bush's support for Texas
legislation that would have banned gay adoptions and his failure to
support a state hate-crimes bill. Bush has also caused concern by
giving mixed signals on gay political appointments. After saying in
a newspaper interview that he would not discriminate, he reportedly
told religious leaders in a meeting that he would not appoint
anyone who is openly gay.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, by contrast, criticized his Senate colleagues for taking
so long to confirm San Francisco philanthropist James Hormel, who
is openly gay, as ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences with the gay community, Bush and
McCain are seen as the tolerant edge of the GOP field. Their
rivals, with the exception of Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, have toed a
much harder line against gays.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes said he would allow gays in his administration, but
added: ``If a person wants a job to make a statement, they won't
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, only partly tongue-in-cheek, said he cannot imagine
why anyone who is gay would ever want to serve in his
administration, and said he would worry about their mental health
if they did. Alan Keyes refers to homosexuality as ``an
abomination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At least Bradley and Gore are coming out into the sunlight,''
Birch said. ``The Republicans are caught somewhere back in a
depressing rain shower.''

 BREAKING NEWS FROM THE ZOOKEEPER AT SFO  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's a busy time at good old SFO (Sardines
Freaking Out), so busy that airport manager Kim Dickie doesn't have
time to translate her thoughts into standard bureaucratese.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a zoo,'' Dickie said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But every time I go to the zoo, it's uncrowded and
peaceful, the animals are calm and playful and well-fed, and
nobody's weeping or swearing.
</P>
<P>
   Although I do remember one time when the zoo was very crowded,
tempers were short and nerves frazzled, and I heard one monkey tell
another, ``Man, this place is an  &UR; airport.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dickie also said of SFO (and stop the presses), ``There are tons
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means, you travelers, that you've been eating way too much
of that sumptuous airport food.
</P>
<P>
   If it's any consolation to folks lost in the SFO Triangle, it's
nice to reflect on the continuity of mankind's adventures. We came
into the 20th century struggling to fly, and we're going out the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   OUT OF HER TREE: Congratulations to Butterfly, who came down
from her perch in a redwood tree named Luna in Humboldt County,
Calif., and now that tree can be turned into newsprint for this
column praising her. The circle of life.
</P>
<P>
   Could be a trend. What if one of the fur-coat protesters at
Neiman Marcus were to climb the giant N-M atrium Christmas tree and
camp out at the top? What if Terence Hallinan and Bill Fazio were
to camp together at the top of the Union Square Christmas tree to
protest the slow vote count?
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, what Butterfly did was amazing. I hope the
Pacific Lumber people honor their agreement to change the company
name to Pacific Serial Tree Murderers &AMP; Land Rapists.
</P>
<P>
   YOU CAN'T put your kids in the front seat of the car, because
they'll be injured by air bags. Now a study shows that they're not
safe in the back seat, either, because they can get injured by the
front seat.
</P>
<P>
   New best option: roof racks.
</P>
<P>
   I AM TIBURON, hear me roar: An item last week told of the
opening of an In-N-Out burger palace in Tiburon, the suburban
enclave north of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong on several counts.
</P>
<P>
   Error I: In-N-Out isn't a restaurant, it's a religious shrine.
I've witnessed miracles at In-N-Out, like opening the bag and
finding it filled with exactly what I ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Error II: This particular In-N-Out isn't in Tiburon, after all.
It's between Mill Valley and Tiburon in an unincorporated place
known as Strawberry. Every person in Tiburon e-mailed or phoned me
to alert me to my stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   Error III: This isn't the only In-N-Out without a drive-thru
window. There's one in Placentia.
</P>
<P>
   Error IV: Tiburones would  &UR; never  &LR; allow an In-N-Out on their
soil. Their policy on such matters is NIMBY (Not In-vicinity-of My
Big Yacht). If a tacky burger franchise muscled its way into
Tiburon, the citizens would commit mass suicide by jumping into the
bay from the roof of Sam's Anchor Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I sense a strong undercurrent of inter-village
hostility. Tiburones are peeved at being mistaken for their tacky
neighbors, and Strawberrians feel they got stuck with a busy, noisy
burger barn that is now being frequented by smug Tiburones.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned, it could get ugly.
</P>
<P>
   THOUSANDS DIE every year in veterans hospitals around the
country due to goofs.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes, according to the news story, include ``surgery on
the wrong body part or wrong patient,'' and ``therapeutic
misadventures.''
</P>
<P>
   This story has TV sitcom written all over it. High concept: a
cross between ``ER'' and ``Pardon My Blooper,'' to be called
``ERR.''
</P>
<P>
   KIDS UNDER 10, please skip this item. (But thanks for reading
this far.)
</P>
<P>
   Barring political intervention, Santa Claus will be fried in an
electric chair Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new high-tech horror revue opening at the Union Square
Playhouse, ``Squished Eyeball Theater.'' It includes the world's
only simulated electric-chair execution, the guillotining of an
audience member and Elvis rising from the dead (I know he's not
dead, but use your imagination).
</P>
<P>
   Sure to be the feel-good entertainment hit of the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa bit is just a cheap publicity stunt. Producer Bob
Pritikin is hoping Willie Brown or one of the two DA candidates
will come on over and ``pardon'' Old Saint Nick.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a wise political move to me. Then maybe the pol can
get naked and take a shower with the exhumed Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   AND THIS is spooky: You mention Elvis in one item and boom, he
pops up again in the next item.
</P>
<P>
   In the Carmel, Calif., Pine Cone's police and sheriff's log,
this entry (spotted by Daryl Glen): ``Woman reported someone
entering her locked car in the Lodge parking lot, without force,
and removing an Elvis cassette. When asked to check her car again
to look for the cassette, she found it in the cassette deck, but
assured the deputy that it had not been there before. Nothing
further.''
</P>
<P>
   That is truly eerie. Sounds like a case for Scully and Mulder.
Or Toody and Muldoon. Ooh! Ooh!

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Trouble in the back seat
 &HT;    (For release Dec. 22, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This subject should not be treated lightly but it is a
head-scratcher. It is, in the coinage of the recently late Joseph
Heller, a Catch-22. It is about where in automobiles children ought
to be sitting _ or, rather, where they should not be sitting.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, it was judged that children should not be sitting
in the front seat because of erupting air bags in an accident. Now,
according to a study done by the Los Angeles Times, they also
should not be sitting in the back seat, this based on unsubstantial
front seats that pitch backwards.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to accept both cautions, then where are the kids going
to sit?
</P>
<P>
   In earlier years, with four children, there have been
aggravating times when I conjured stashing them in the trunk, but
eventually dismissed it because of a lack of air holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every action there is always opposed an equal reaction,''
Sir Isaac Newton told us hundreds of years ago. It didn't take an
apple hitting me in the head to recognize the genius of Newton's
observation.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anything happens today where someone or something else
does not counter with an equally plausible theory.
</P>
<P>
   The study of children in automobile back seats certainly ranks
there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reported
that properly restrained children in the back seat have the lowest
crash death rates. And likely that remains accurate.
</P>
<P>
   But just when you were beginning to think your kids were safe,
they aren't _ as least not according to this study. While including
a caveat that the back seat still is the safest place in the car,
statistics are presented that show the danger of putting your child
there.
</P>
<P>
   The Times found at least six children in the 1990s who were
killed while seated _ and restrained _ in the back seats of
automobiles. They were victims of front seats collapsing backwards
in accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``While federal authorities issued air bag warnings in 1995
after the deaths of eight children,'' wrote the Times, ``it has not
notified consumers about the back seat hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Factory-made warnings are posted on the sun visors of my
late-model automobile, to wit: Children under 12 can be killed by
air bags; they should be in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who are safety-conscious have banned children from
the front seats in response to the warnings. But now comes a
warning from the back.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there are collisions where neither front seat nor
back is safe, either for children or adults, but given the small
fender benders or rear-enders, the driving public ought to feel
safe.
</P>
<P>
   The matter of a collapsing front seat is both a bureaucratic and
industry lapse. For 33 years, federal motor vehicle safety
regulations have not been adequate to prevent seat collapse. The
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has conceded that
but done nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Some auto manufacturers have reacted by strengthening their
front seats and the bolts that hold them to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   A susceptible public becomes bleary under the weight of the
endless studies that tell us that what was good for us then is not
now or what was not good for us then isn't so bad compared to the
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Good parents want their children safe. They'll put them anywhere
in the automobile that assures that. As a result of this recent
study, there is no such place. It's another classic example of
choosing one's poison.
</P>
<P>
   If it is true that automobile manufacturers can remedy the back
seat problem by making better and stronger front seats, then let
them voluntarily choose to do it. Failing that, the federal
regulations need to be revamped and imposed on them.
</P>
<P>
   Parents forever will be taking their children somewhere, to
school, to church, to the movies, to grandma. We need to know they
will be safe, not victimized by an air bag or a collapsing front
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Is that too much to ask?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The U.N.'s anti-Israel slant
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United Nations has no standing in the Israeli-Syrian or
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks but there's a way the U.N. could be
helpful even so. It could get off Israel's back.
</P>
<P>
   In more diplomatic but still firm language, that was the message
from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a recent speech. Annan
was repeating, with new emphasis, a point he first made on a visit
to Israel last year.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. effectively created Israel by partitioning the old
Palestine Mandate into predominantly Arab and predominantly Jewish
parts in 1947. Israel was an enthusiastic participant in the world
body until Soviet Cold War politics, in trouble-making cahoots with
Arab and Muslim animus, turned a U.N. majority against Israel after
it won the 1967 Six-Day War, the second of three that Arab states
launched trying to destroy Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, U.N. majorities have pounded on Israel like a manic
drummer.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has tried to force Israel to settle with the
Arab states on Arab terms. It annually passes old and new
resolutions favoring Palestinian interests and condemning Israeli
actions and positions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. has provided a willing forum for vicious anti-Semitism,
like the 1991 claim there by the Syrian ambassador that Jews kill
Christian children to use their blood in making matzoh or the
charge in 1997 by the Palestinian representative that Israel was
injecting Palestinian children with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for 16 years, until it repealed the notorious resolution
in1991, the U.N. offically declared Zionism a form of racism and
only last year did it finally recognize anti-Semitism as a human
rights offense. U.N. ``Special Committees'' and ``Palestinian
Units'' still churn out and distribute anti-Israel propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, alone of all member nations, Israel has been denied
membership in any of the U.N.'s five regional groups.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is barred from participating and voting in most
major U.N. organizations and from being elected as a non-permanent
member of the Security Council. Israel has always been shut out of
the Asian group, which includes all other Mideast states, and now
its bid to join the European group is on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has a government keen to do deals with Syria and the
Palestinians. Negotiations on both fronts are at critical stages,
with the best chance yet that each might come to fruition. For that
to happen, however, Israel will have to make painful and, to a
degree, even risky decisions about ceding buffering territory. And
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said he will submit any
Syrian treaty to a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The issues will be settled _ if they are setttled _ by hard
negotiations, not good vibes. But the atmosphere for making
compromises and especially for public endorsement of the
compromises would be helped if, as Annan has urged, the U.N.
stopped indulging gratuitous grandstanding against Israel and
admitted Israel to full United Nations participation.

 &HT;    Big, bright moon to welcome new year
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In recognition of Western civilization's
frenzied quest to find a divine _ or, at least, cosmic _ sign that
the end of the millennium approaches, try this:
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is alight with e-mails declaring that Wednesday
night's last full moon of the millennium will be the brightest
first night of winter in 133 years, perhaps portending disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Startlingly bright,'' said Jack Horkheimer, director of the
Miami Space Transit Planetarium. ``The moon will be brightest at
midnight almost directly overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Biggest, brightest and baddest,'' joked Erich Landstrom,
director of astronomy education at the South Florida Science Museum
in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Remember what happened the night of Dec. 21, 1866: Crazy Horse
and the Lakota Sioux took advantage of the bright moonlight to
ambush and kill 80 U.S. soldiers in the Wyoming territory.
</P>
<P>
   A moon so bright that in the snow-covered north, car headlights
won't be needed.
</P>
<P>
   A moon so close that the Old Farmer's Almanac warns of
abnormally high tides and coastal flooding.
</P>
<P>
   All the result of a cosmic triple coincidence of perigee,
solstice, syzygy and near perihelion _ that is, when the moon and
earth are closest, on the first day of winter, in a straight line
with the sun and when the earth is almost at its closest to the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast, say astronomers and meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium moon is not don't-stare-directly-at-the-moon
bright and most folks won't be able to discern that it's larger
than July's full moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is the width of a small fingernail held at
arm's length,'' Landstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell if you could get two full moons side by side
but that doesn't happen very often,'' said Geoff Chester of the
U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what will happen Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   The winter solstice occurs at 2:44 a.m., when the North Pole
tilts the farthest away from the sun, marking the beginning of
winter in the northern hemisphere and the shortest daylight of the
year. The moon will travel almost directly overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:55 a.m., the moon reaches perigee in its elliptical orbit
around the earth _ its closest approach of the year to the earth at
220,000 miles, thereby causing its greatest effect on the tides.
The moon will be 14 percent closer to earth than in July, when it
is at its apogee, or farthest distance from the earth.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:31 p.m., the moon becomes full and at syzygy (SIZZ ah
gee), meaning the earth is sandwiched between the sun and moon in a
nearly straight line, also causing the highest and lowest tides of
the month. Wednesday night is when you will see the full moon.
</P>
<P>
   Perihelion occurs Jan. 3, when earth is closest to the sun, 91.4
million miles, increasing the sunlight reaching the moon by 7
percent over July.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cool combination of things, and the poet in me loves
it,'' said Sten Oldenwald, an astronomer at the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Maryland. ``But it is not particularly rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the happenstance hasn't happened on the same day in 133
years, it happens within 24 hours about every 19 years or so. It
last occurred in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   MOON VISIBLE FOR 13 HOURS
</P>
<P>
   The difference between low and high tides Wednesday and Thursday
will be about 4.1 feet, the widest range of the year, said Jim
Lushine of the National Weather Service in Miami. The typical range
is about 3 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have to worry are boaters who might bottom out
or get stuck on shoals at low tide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shortest day of the year means the longest night. The moon
will be visible for nearly 13 hours, from 5:49 p.m. Wednesday to
6:46 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real wow factor is when the moon rises above the horizon,
that's when it looks the largest,'' said Chester of the Naval
Observatory. ``It's an optical illusion. It looks large in relation
to other objects on the horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   For chroniclers of millennium events, the millennium moon isn't
one. ``It's not even the end of the millennium,'' said Chester.
</P>
<P>
   That's next year, when a a partial solar eclipse on Christmas
Day closes the year 2000 and the true end of the millennium is
marked. But that's another story.

 &HT;    The hole in the comics page
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ It is still difficult for me to imagine a
newspaper without ``Peanuts.'' But that's probably because I don't
want to.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schulz recently announced he will no longer draw the
strip. He is 77, battling cancer and has drawn round-headed
children for a half century. His decision should be no surprise.
But it is.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz's work ethic and sense of craft were such that he drew
his strips himself and still has enough to last until Jan. 3. This
gives people time to get used to the idea. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   I look at the comics page and feel like an old fart. I see past
the tiny panels to what used to be there. ``The Far Side,''
``Calvin and Hobbes,'' ``Bloom County'' and others you probably
don't remember or haven't heard of. That's not counting the ones
long gone. Artifacts of ancient graphic history: ``Pogo'' _
``Pogo'' most of all _ ``Steve Canyon,'' ``Terry and the Pirates,''
``Dick Tracy'' ... .
</P>
<P>
   Comic strips insinuate themselves into your life. They are not
like other entertainments. Television series run a few months or a
year or two. You expect them to come and go. Comic strips don't
work that way.
</P>
<P>
   They are so much a part of a day's routine, so personally
comforting that even in the unsentimental newspaper business, we
expect them never to die. Each casualty is a shock and readers
write in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Immortality is a bad thing in humor. I give Schulz huge credit
for forswearing it. He won't allow anyone to take over his comic.
After he stops, his syndicate will rerun his old strips rather than
passing the franchise to less devoted hands.
</P>
<P>
   I usually skip over immortal comic strips. They exist not
because they are funny, but because they vaguely remind people of a
time when they used to amuse.
</P>
<P>
   When new artists take over a strip, it's a lot like new owners
taking over a beloved old landmark house. One of three things
happens. They will remodel and jazz it up past recognition, adding
stucco, tile roofs, satellite dishes and picture windows to a
Victorian
</P>
<P>
   exterior.
</P>
<P>
   Or they treat it like a historic site. One of those places that
look as if they were hit with a neutron bomb after everyone had
cleaned up for company. Everything looks grand but there's no life
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Or, saddest of all, they just let it slowly fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Second-, third- and fourth-generation strips are updated in ways
that make no sense, treated as period-piece gag machines or are
simply passed hand-to-hand to artists who are successively less
interested in the job.
</P>
<P>
   It's instructive to find some of the oldest ones reprinted in
books. How strange to discover they possessed a life. That they
once were funny. It's like finding out your grandfather had a
girlfriend. And she looked hot.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt I would be writing for a newspaper were it not for the
comics page. They were what first fooled me into thinking that this
is an exciting, romantic enterprise. I started reading the comics
and only gradually got snagged into reading the rest.
</P>
<P>
   I even read the serial strips, an endangered species hardly
sighted any more except in degraded form.
</P>
<P>
   Readers are no longer assumed to have the patience, regular
habits, time and memory to follow a strip with a yearlong plot
line. Our loss.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many products of our culture, cartoons are marketed to
death. The strip that appears in the newspaper often is a mere loss
leader. More important are posters, books, TV specials, key chains,
toys, video games, cards, stickers and product endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if a strip with the subtle, sweet-natured, beating
heart of ``Peanuts'' would make it past the gauntlet of marketing
advisors, focus groups and concept engineers that inhabit modern
media. Too low concept. It targets no identifiable demographic
segment. The gags are wistful, not yuk out loud. If submitted now
instead of in 1950, it would never fly. Every smart guy in the
building would agree.
</P>
<P>
   Without ``Peanuts,'' I worry about the comic page. Even more
than when those other strips left. Sure, the comics page still will
keep company with my cereal. But with Charlie Brown gone, I'll be
even more uncertain of whether I've gotten bigger or the page has
really gotten that much smaller.

 &HT;    A friend and a role model
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDWICH, Mass. _ I have an old friend who lives in a
gray-shingled house on Cape Cod, that arm of land flexing upward
into the Atlantic just off the Massachusetts coast, its finger
pointed toward Boston. She builds garden furniture from fallen tree
limbs and has meaningful conversations with her plants.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in Gail's formative years, vowels and consonants
became confused, which explains why she calls her friends
``Ahh-thuh'' and ``Riter.'' ``Cuber'' is an island where Castro
reigns, and ``baahking'' is what the neighbor's dog does when the
``gaahbage'' truck rumbles around. Every evening for supper, she
has brie cheese on crackers, a shrimp cocktail, and just a drop or
two of pinot grigio for her stomach's sake, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Gail and I have been friends since 1976, when we met at a
needlework school in East Townsend. I remember she had a bad
headache and missed class one day. She remembers that I neglected
to bring a long gown for our graduation dinner and so as not to
look out of place around the table, chose to wear my bathrobe _
with pearls of course.
</P>
<P>
   Gail and I have been friends through three husbands (her two, my
one) and four children (her three, my one). Now she has two
grandchildren and I have a daughter-in-law. It's been a long time
since either of us has thought about having a husband.
</P>
<P>
   Our families have been spending holidays together since the
children were small. Gail is the one who taught me to make scratch
pizza crust one snowy evening as one daughter banged noisily on the
old upright piano and the other bathed Toots the turtle in the
kitchen sink. The two boys were busy stoking a roaring blaze in the
fireplace she'd had built right after her first husband died.
</P>
<P>
   Between us we've weathered failed marriages, bouts of
self-employment, college (ours and our kids'), school teaching,
boyfriends, and sagging body parts _ not always good-naturedly, but
never without our homegrown variety of wicked humor where we can
giggle like crazy women over the latest basement flood or boyfriend
defection. Laugh or die was our motto.
</P>
<P>
   Gail paints birdhouses and substitute teaches. I write. Neither
of us understands a budget. All we know is, when we don't have it
we can't spend it. We've both been there and done that.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't bother Gail when her paintings hang crooked. I'm the
screwball who straightens pictures in public waiting rooms. We are
the original ``Odd Couple'' _ I'm Felix, she's Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Gail's house is loaded with neat stuff _ tons of it. That's how
I learned that lavender objects placed in a southwest corner will
attract money. ``Feng shui,'' she told me, the ancient Asian folk
belief that suggests the careful arrangement of objects in a room
brings good fortune. When she was visiting last month she nestled a
sprig of lavender, a polished purple stone, and a tree
</P>
<P>
   ornament on the bookcase in the corner of my bedroom. I added a
hunk of amethyst my son had brought from Colorado. I'm not sure how
long it takes to work.
</P>
<P>
   Gail's home is filled with books and plants, and lace hanging
over the lampshades. She works jigsaw puzzles on the dining room
table and watches birds from an easy chair beside the kitchen
window. She needlepoints Christmas stockings and buys two of every
storybook _ one for the grandchildren and one for herself so she
can read to the kids over the phone while they follow along.
</P>
<P>
   Gail has always been a risk taker. She's had the courage to jump
up and bite life on the backside, and the spunk not to apologize
when she flops on hers.
</P>
<P>
   I want to be just like her when I grow up.

 &HT;    See you later, escalator
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Oh man, it's holiday time. And you know what
that means? Yes, there will be a crush of holiday shoppers. Yes,
there will be a plethora of mall workers pushing free sampples of
products you wouldn't buy if they paid you. Above all that, the
most annoying aspect of the holiday season is that there will be
crowded escalators. Escalators packed with anxious shoppers trying
to get to the big sale at Bath &AMP; Body Works. Escalators crammed
with annoying teens chatting away on their parents' cell phones
while munching on soft pretzels. Escalators jammed with elderly
mall walkers on their way to level two for a change of scenery.
Then, there's the most annoying aspect of holiday escalators: those
little punks (let loose by browsing parents) who insist on walking
down the ``up'' escalator. I know, this ritual is an age-old
holiday tradition, but tradition or not, it's totally annoying;
annoying enough to be declared Annoying Gadget of the Week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ www.this.com _ If the idea of a ``safe''
Internet is about as appealing as a Stepford wives potluck,
this.com may not be the place for you. But if you're a parent and
you're worried about what your kids are viewing on the Internet
(and whether they've washed behind the ears), this.com provides
``filtered Internet access,'' the online equivalent of wearing a
condom. Links from this.com are guaranteed to be free of smut.
</P>
<P>
   www.thehungersite.com _ Feel like making a difference? Unlike
those annoying chain e-mails that promise to save a child's life if
you just forward a message to all your friends, this Web site
really does do charity work, and all it takes is a click from you.
At The Hunger Site, clicking a button will donate 1/4 cup of food
per sponsor to countries that need it. With the help of companies
such as Infospace, the click-through program is donating more than
50 tons of food a week to the United Nations World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   www.selectsmart.com _ SelectSmart takes the pain and agony out
of life decisions. Can't decide for whom to vote next November? Use
the Presidential Candidate Selector to find the candidate who
matches your political views when you answer a list of questions.
Want the best wine for an upcoming dinner? Answer the questions and
it'll match you with a suitable vintage. And best of all, you can
get your palm read by matching your hand with illustrations of palm
lines. A lifesaver for the indecisive.
</P>
<P>
   www.obitdetails.com _ It's never too late to think about death
(unless you're dead, of course), and if you're in a morbid mood, or
just want to honor a dead person you know, hop on to
obitdetails.com, an obituary listing site. For a one-time fee of
$145, you can post a lasting obituary that includes sound and video
clips. As the company says in its press mailing, ``Who cares if
you're not a celebrity? No matter your notoriety, everyone deserves
to be remembered.'' For those of who don't leave much of a legacy
behind, here's hoping somebody will be willing to bookmark us.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the battle for mobile phones that include
wireless Internet access heating up, PrimeCo's latest consumer
model, the PCX-3500XL ($159 after rebate, www.primeco.com) is
curiously absent of Web access features. The company admits it's a
few months behind on the technology being rolled out by Sprint PCS.
What the 3500XL, a titanium gray flip phone made by Audiovox, does
have is a sleek feel at a feather-light 4.4 ounces, a hands-free
kit, editable phone rings and enough battery lifefor 120 minutes of
talk time.

 &HT;    Store data online, at no cost
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you've ever needed to wipe your hard disk
completely clean and didn't have a Zip drive or other offline
storage device for stashing the information, you already know what
a hassle it is to back up all that data onto floppy disks.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a way to get 300 megabytes of storage for free. You
can use it for whatever you like, and the uses are limited to times
when you need to reformat the disk.
</P>
<P>
   This storage is furnished by a Web site, so that means that your
most precious information would remain safe, even if your computer
were destroyed by fire. Businesses have used off-site storage for
years, and the Internet is filled with sites that offer storage.
</P>
<P>
   But this site is different in a couple of ways. You get the 300
megabytes of storage free, and this site is aimed directly at
Macintosh owners. Simply go to the site at FreeMacSpace.com,
register and the space is yours.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the site's organizer had to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual hard drives for the Macintosh community are a perfect
match for Apple's iMac users and for the large community of
designers and artists who use high-end Macs,'' said Ari Freeman,
co-founder and chief strategic officer at FreeDiskSpace.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the iMac, iBook, G3 and G4 computers do not ship with a
floppy drive, our virtual hard drives provide these users with an
easy and free solution to securely store and, if they choose, share
any type of file they wish. Mac-based designers who commonly work
with large files will find storing, sharing and collaboration of
files to be as simple as turning on their computers.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also advertises itself as a place to stash important
files in case the Y2K glitch bites. But as a Macintosh owner, you
are almost certainly safe. Unlike PCs, most Macintoshes are
Y2K-proof. Apple says its recent models are safe until 29940 A.D.,
and chances are you'll need a new Mac by then.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, working antiques like the Apple II may not be so
bulletproof. Some of these machines are still doing honest work. If
you're using one, you may want to back up your information, just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, although you're probably safe from Y2K woes, some of you
may enjoy the New Year more if you've backed up your most important
files and stored them away on this site.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced virtual hard drives _ at separate
sites _ for other systems including PC, Linux and personal digital
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The site promises good security as far as protecting your
information.

 &HT;    MP3.com, Slate flourished during a notable Web year
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ End-of-the-year lists are as inevitable as death and
taxes. At the end of the century, it's a good thing the Web isn't
1,000 years old or even 10. This subjective list of 1999's notable
Web achievements won't make anybody think back further than
January.
</P>
<P>
   Upset of the year: MP3.com (www.mp3.com)
</P>
<P>
   It's just amazing how one Web site can single-handedly turn the
music industry upside down. MP3.com's extensive collection of
downloadable digital music, combined with the music industry's
initial reluctance to release music for sale via the Web, created a
demand for digital music that can no longer be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Most improved player: Slate (www.slate.com)
</P>
<P>
   After so much hype, so many misfires and a failed subscription
plan, Slate has finally found its way in the online world. Its
thoughtful political coverage and stable of experienced writers
have transformed Slate from Microsoft's and Editor Michael
Kinsley's goofy hobby to a Web site actually worth reading. Expect
sparks to fly as election 2000 shifts into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Best use of a chat room: Atlanta office worker ``Hey Y'all''
</P>
<P>
   While hiding under her desk in an Atlanta office building, Leigh
Frey signed on to the CNN current events chat room using the
pseudonym ``Hey Y'all.'' She used the chat room to get the latest
news about gunman Mark O. Barton's shooting spree in the Piedmont
Center office complex where she worked. Other chatters were
skeptical but provided needed information and words of
encouragement. Proof that community on the Web isn't just about
geeky teen-age boys looking for love.
</P>
<P>
   Best search engine that just searches: (www.google.com)
</P>
<P>
   It's just one page with a box to type in your query. No free
e-mail, no online shopping, no chat rooms, no message boards.
There's nothing to do here but search the Web, and the results are
good. You click, you search, you read. Portals are like, you know,
so five minutes ago.
</P>
<P>
   Best place to try and make a quick buck: eBay (www.ebay.com)
</P>
<P>
   From human body parts to souvenirs of the World Trade
Organization riots in Seattle, eBay proves that Web auctions are an
endless source of fascination, a great source for obscure
collectibles and an outlet for every scam artist around. EBay
catches most of them, but not before the media have a field day.
</P>
<P>
   Best example that two heads really are better than one _ and get
more attention, too: MindSpring/EarthLink, EarthLink/MindSpring
merger
</P>
<P>
   I say tomato, you say tomahto; however you look at it, it's
still going to be the second-largest Internet service provider
after behemoth America Online. With 3 million subscribers and a
prototype deal with AT&AMP;T for open access to cable lines, the
MindSpring/EarthLink combo may have extended the potential lifespan
of the ISP well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Best candidate for induction into the Silicon Valley Boys Club:
CMGI President David Wetherell
</P>
<P>
   When Lycos tried to merge with Barry Diller and Ticketmaster,
majority stockholder Wetherell was there to quash the deal. He then
snapped up failing search engine AltaVista and reinvented it as a
shopping and services site, and he's not done yet. The
Massachusetts businessman proves you don't need offices in Palo
Alto to play the Web game and win.
</P>
<P>
   Best argument for holiday shopping at the mall:
</P>
<P>
   e-toys.com, Toysrus.com, kbkids.com. (tie)
</P>
<P>
   Not even little Cindy-Lou Who could save millions of online
shoppers from frustration, disappointment, out-of-stock items and
poor customer service. Why toy retailers were unprepared for one of
their biggest seasons of the year is a mystery they need to solve
before December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Best online example that war is hell: The first-person accounts
of the war in Kosovo from Belgrade radio station B92
(www.freeb92.net)
</P>
<P>
   Many called the war in Kosovo the first Internet war as millions
of Bosnians took to their laptops and described the NATO bombing of
Belgrade. Their stories were often-chilling accounts of life during
wartime that won't be easily forgotten.

   One of the most popular basketball games in the computer world
is ``NBA Live'' from EA Sports. A new edition of that game _ ``NBA
Live 2000'' _ is just out. It's available for PlayStation and
Nintendo 64. Some of the nifty new features include the ability to
challenge Michael Jordan for a little one-on-one. You'll also be
able to customize the on-screen players _ almost a build-a-person
kit _ changing the way a face looks, altering hairstyles and skin
color, and even changing eye colors.
</P>
<P>
   Also new on shelves is ``South Park, Chef's Luv Shack,'' for PC
systems. This game from Aklaim is based on the popular TV show.
Parents should note that _ as is true in the TV show _ the content
may be objectionable for some. But if the TV show is on your
family's approved list, the game should be fine, too. You'll need a
Pentium II running at 233 megahertz with 64 megabytes of RAM to
enjoy the game, although it should run on systems as sluggish as a
Pentium166.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever received an e-mail and wanted to find out a little
more about the source? One way is to look up the domain name.
Finding out where the originating site is located can help. There's
a Web site at dedicated
</P>
<P>
   .rapidserver.com/whois.html that can provide some of this
information.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if stuff like anonymous e-mail is driving you crazy, maybe
you should drop in at www
</P>
<P>
   .allhealth.com/onlinepsych/. Besides some psychological mind
games, you'll also find various tests to check out your
personality, or lack of one.

 &HT;    64 Net-related business plans will be whittled to one winner
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite record online sales, few people except the
ones who run the pornography sites are making much money selling
stuff on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, venture capitalists are lending millions of dollars so
college graduates, and sometimes college dropouts, can test
e-commerce business plans.
</P>
<P>
   How can you tap that?
</P>
<P>
   Hummer Winblad partners, one of Silicon Valley's most respected
venture capital firms, is holding a business plan contest modeled
on one of our nation's greatest sports events: March Madness, the
NCAA basketball tournament, where 64 teams play their way down to
one champion.
</P>
<P>
   The contest, online at winbig.humwin.com, is soliciting business
plans from any student at any accredited school. The 64 best plans,
one per school, get to compete. The 16 finalists will have a chance
to present their plan to the Hummer Winblad folks March 23. The
winner will be named March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The idea must be Internet-related.
</P>
<P>
   THE MILLENNIUM AFTER NEXT
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago we had pretty clear ideas about what we thought
life in the 2000s would be like. The Jetsons pretty well nailed it:
cars that fly, robots that clean and meals that come in the form of
pills. None of which is all or even some of the rage yet.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe we can get better. One Web site,
www.brainticklers.com, is all about guessing what life will be like
in 3000.
</P>
<P>
   The site poses questions on issues divided by category,
including: our bodies, our cells; our planet; money and power;
technology; energy and travel; inner life; family life.
</P>
<P>
   You can search by topic, read a question and pose an answer that
stays on the site. That's one of the nicer things about the
Internet: Thanks to chat groups and message boards, the random
brilliance or random stupidity of people is given a kind of
permanence.
</P>
<P>
   One recent Q and A:
</P>
<P>
   Q: From mead to coffee, business beverages have gone from merry
to performance fuel. What will we drink at business meetings in
3000?
</P>
<P>
   A: Water.
</P>
<P>
   The site was started by Elizabeth Arnold, an entrepreneur,
writer, executive coach and feng shui consultant; and Rod
Beckstrom, chairman of a financial risk management systems company.
</P>
<P>
   A list of best of this and best of that sites
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Internet Life has ranked the 100 best Web sites for the
new year.
</P>
<P>
   The January 2000 issue broke the sites into categories.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment and sports rankings included:
</P>
<P>
   _ Best movie site: The Internet movie database, www.imbd.com,
now part of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best television hub: TV Guide online, www.tvguide.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best TV network, PBS Online, www.pbs.org.

 &HT;    IBM's 1480 ThinkPad puts whistles atop bells
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'm writing this on the finest laptop computer I've
ever used, but curiously a lot of the high-end bells and whistles
built into IBM's Model 1480 ThinkPad don't have anything to do with
computing.
</P>
<P>
   The 1480, apparently, has reached the limits of the mobile
computing envelope. Oh, I'm sure that you can get plenty of laptops
that run a little faster _ the 1480 is, after all, running on an
Intel Celeron chip of a mere 466 MHz _ but you'd be hard-pressed to
notice it.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a 6-meg hard drive, 14.5-inch LCD display with an ATI
video card that has 4 megabytes of RAM, 64 megs of memory, and a
DVD drive along with a floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   The modem is a Lucent Technologies V.90 model that achieved 48k
and better on my telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   None of that constitutes bells and whistles; it's just good
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the bells and whistles, my favorites first:
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of the lid, there's a little light. Turn it on in
the daylight, and you won't even see it. But turn it on in the
dark, and it provides just enough light to let you read the
keyboard. Now, you might think that's silly, and I probably would
have agreed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But this past summer I had to write an article on deadline in
the passenger seat of a car flying down Interstate 85 in the dead
of night. No problem, I suppose, for an accomplished typist, but
I'm not one of those, and I doubt a lot of laptop users are. The
National Security Agency would have been hard-pressed to decode the
results of that adventure. This little light would have been a
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Next is the Internet scroll bar, a big paddle kind of thing
right behind the small paddle things that serve as mouse buttons on
the deck in front of the keyboard. You can use this paddle in
conjunction with the mouse stick to scroll through Web pages
without having to stay on the scroll bars. That's very nice, but
why not extend it to internal applications as well?
</P>
<P>
   Then you've got the four color-coded buttons above the keyboard.
These are preset to use various functions of the Web services IBM
and Lycos have created, but you can customize them to do anything
you wish.
</P>
<P>
   There's a built-in microphone, and also a microphone jack.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the flashy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   At the front of the deck, protrudinga bit so it can still be
used when the computer is turned off and the lid is closed, are
controls and a little window to let you play music disks, or even
DVD movies, through the S-video output to a television set. Oh,
wow.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, at extra cost but what the heck, you can buy
optional covers for the 1480 in seven different colors, not all of
which, one assumes, are blue.
</P>
<P>
   Along with all of these wonders, of course you have the
inescapable evils of all laptops: disagreeable cursor control
devices and a cramped keyboard. The video display can be viewed
quite well from any angle in any light. However, the brightness and
contrast controls had little, if any, effect on it.
</P>
<P>
   As mentioned, IBM has opted for the mouse stick in the middle of
the keyboard instead of the little trackball or the little panel
you diddle with your finger. I don't like any of these. There is,
of course, a standard mouse port for those situations in which you
can use one.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is less cramped than many, and most of the keys are
where you expect to find them. And, of course, you can plug in a
standard keyboard when you wish.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you have the price _ $2,200 _ which is roughly twice
what you might pay for the same features in a desktop, but about
half what a top-of-the-line laptop would have cost a couple of
years ago. Computing on the go will always command a premium, I
suppose.

 &HT;    Keep Windows 2000 in mind when buying or upgrading
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While normal people are getting ready for the
holidays, the real geeks and wireheads among us have started
thinking about getting home computers ready for Windows 2000, the
coming edition of Windows that should be released early in the new
year.
</P>
<P>
   I've been using beta copies of 2000 for several months now. It's
not really fair to critique Windows based on test copies, since the
whole idea of a beta test is to find problems and bugs in the
software. But, all in all, it seems as if it will be (and it should
be) better than Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Based on my experience, here are some things that will help you
get ready for Windows 2000 if you're thinking of buying a new
computer or upgrading the one that you have.
</P>
<P>
   Memory: Windows 95 and 98 used memory a lot better than Windows
3.1, but both are still flawed. For technical reasons that would
take too long to explain, some computers running these versions of
Windows actually slowed down after much more than 64 megabytes of
RAM were installed. Windows 2000 is built on the more robust
backbone of Windows NT (the industrial strength version of Windows)
and handles memory a lot better. It also seems to need more memory.
I'd suggest 128 megabytes of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories: Not every accessory that you are now using with
Windows 95 or 98 will work with Windows 2000. That applies even to
brand-new devices. For instance, just weeks ago I got a demo
version of a new game controller that plugs into the joystick port.
It won't work with Windows 2000. A smart buyer would know in
advance, since the package clearly stated that the controller
wasn't compatible with Windows NT (and, as I said, that's the
framework Windows 2000 is built on). So if you're shopping for
accessories, check the package to make sure that they'll work with
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Software: It's the same story here. Not all of your software
will work with Windows 2000. When you install 2000, the program
does a good job of identifying the programs on its list of
incompatible programs.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a tip, though. Many of the programs that 2000 flagged as
incompatible ran just fine, so don't delete those old programs
without actually trying them. And when you buy new software, look
on the package to make sure that it's Windows 2000 compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the important ``gotchas'' to think about. But there
are some other things to keep in mind. These apply to any computer
running Windows.
</P>
<P>
   USB: That stands for universal serial bus port. Windows 98 and
Window 2000 support this technology, and it's a vast improvement
over the way things used to be. It's much easier to install new
equipment on a computer equipped with USB. You simply plug it in,
and it works. You can plug and unplug the device while the computer
is running, without a bunch of rebooting and reconfiguring. I've
literally never had a moment's trouble installing a USB device. You
can be sure that your new computer will have USB ports. I highly
recommend that _ when you're buying a new scanner, printer or other
device _ you get the USB version.
</P>
<P>
   Video cards: Most people don't know what computer gamers have
understood for a long time. A good video card can speed up your
computer at least as much as going to the next-fastest processor
chip. Even if you're not a gamer, make sure the next video card you
buy has at least 16 megabytes of onboard RAM. My own video card has
32 megabytes of RAM and _ even on my now-antique 350-megahertz
Pentium II machine at home _ things fly.
</P>
<P>
   One last thing to keep in mind. Windows 98 will be around for a
while. There is no law that says you have to buy and install
Windows 2000. But, since most of us probably will move to it
someday, it's smart to keep its requirements in mind when you buy a
new computer or upgrade the old one.

 &HT;    Forecast is for better weather sites
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a reason everyone talks about the weather.
It's one of the things we all have in common.
</P>
<P>
   Weather sites on the Web are among the most frequently
bookmarked. And Atlanta's own Weather Channel has one of the most
popular sites in the nation. But since weather sites are one of the
largest categories on the Web, there are plenty of choices. With
icy and snowy weather probable in the next few months, this is a
good time to see what's out there.
</P>
<P>
   Since Weather.com (www.weather
</P>
<P>
   .com) is the king of the hill, we'll start there. Since most of
us tend to check the weather in the same cities each time _ your
hometown, where you live now, places where relatives live, cities
you visit _ a long-standing feature of the site makes a lot of
sense. You can customize the start page so that every time you
visit, you'll get the weather for cities you select (other features
can be customized, too, but this is the most useful one).
</P>
<P>
   One good change at this site is the completeness of the weather
report. Frankly, the information was once a little skimpy _ the
day's weather was reduced to little more than an icon that showed a
sunny day, or cloudy one, etc., and the predicted highs and lows.
There's more detail now, and that's helpful. Even more detail would
be better. It exists, but you have to select the ``detailed
forecast'' link to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Another excellent source of weather information comes from that
Web standby, Yahoo. Just go to weather.yahoo
</P>
<P>
   .com, and checking the local forecast is easy. Simply type in
the ZIP code (or the name of the city) and you'll get a complete
summary (furnished by Weathernews Inc.).
</P>
<P>
   A standout feature of this site can be tested by following the
link to the long-range forecast. You'll be taken to www
</P>
<P>
   .weatherplanner.com/ (or you can bypass the Yahoo site and go
there yourself) and be able to get a 30-day forecast for your area.
That's a pretty ambitious goal (for instance, the weather for my
neighborhood says that Christmas Day will be clear with highs in
the 50s to 60s. But it's at least as good as guessing and sort of
fun).
</P>
<P>
   The Weather Underground (www
</P>
<P>
   .wunderground.com) site offers some of the most complete weather
information on the Web. If you want to know absolutely everything
about the weather in a city _ literally down to the phase of the
moon, dew point and visibility _ this is a good place to bookmark.
</P>
<P>
   Another unique feature of the site is its ability to translate
the weather news into more than 40 languages. So whether you want
to read the Des Moines weather in Arabic, Afrikaans or Korean, it's
as simple as just using the pull-down menu to change the language.
</P>
<P>
   You can't talk about weather forecasts without considering the
nation's prime source: the National Weather Service. The Weather
Service is, of course, represented on the Web. You'll find it
(among other places) at www.wrh.noaa.gov
</P>
<P>
   /wrhq/nwspage.html.
</P>
<P>
   From that page, you can select from a long list of links that
will take you to various regional centers and also to some of the
Weather Service's specialized weather centers. For instance, you
can go to the National Hurricane Center, various maritime and
aviation centers and the Storm Prediction Center. A serious student
of the weather, or just a person who enjoys knowing more than is
needed, can spend hours here.

 &HT;    Software helps stockbrokers catch false claims in e-mail
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A sure thing!
</P>
<P>
   A guaranteed winner!
</P>
<P>
   100 percent safe!
</P>
<P>
   These words make frequent appearances in spam, the junk e-mail
we hate to get, usually followed by some supposedly unbeatable
offer to invest in a stock. Often, it's not clear where the
messages come from.
</P>
<P>
   But for reputable stockbrokers, they are words to avoid. In
fact, it is illegal for registered representatives of brokerage
houses to use phrases such as ``a sure thing'' in cyberspace,
according to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
National Association of Securities Dealers, which last year issued
a notice to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers, who have been notoriously slow to accept the influence
of the Internet on their business, now have a huge burden: watching
e-mail to make sure the wrong words aren't delivered into a
client's inbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the (regulators) have said, `You've got to watch
over e-mail,''' said Edward Pecelli, a broker with Horner, Townsend
and Kent, a 1,400-representative brokerage in Horsham, Pa. ``You've
got to put a surveillance process into place.''
</P>
<P>
   That burden has become an opportunity for Amicus Inc., an Austin
software company that designs Web-based tools for financial
services companies, especially independent brokerages. Packaging
them with extranets, Amicus began selling a surveillance system
that throws up virtual red flags when noncompliant language appears
in an e-mail from a representative to a client.
</P>
<P>
   While Amicus has sold the application to only about a half-dozen
of its roughly 30 clients, the company is predicting it will become
more popular as more companies are faced with audits of their
communications by the SEC. Bigger investment houses have charged
their internal information technology departments with developing
similar applications.
</P>
<P>
   But the independent broker-dealers that are Amicus' customers
often can't afford a big outlay to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They now get stuck with a job they weren't prepared to deal
with,'' said Dennis Passovoy, chief executive of Amicus. ``When
they get audited, they get told, `Figure out a way to deal with it.
Either come up with a manual system or come up with an automated
system.' That's when we get the phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   Misrepresentations by salespeople were the most common cause for
complaints that investors made to the SEC last year, and electronic
misrepresentations are becoming increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   But for years, e-mails from brokers to clients were not governed
by the same rules that prohibit written statements that claim a
guaranteed return on investment. Typically, brokers submit copies
of letters to their compliance departments to ensure they are not
violating rules that forbid promising that a risky investment will
pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Amicus' ToolBelt 98-11 _ named for NASD Notice 98-11, which
alerted the securities industry to the rule change _ uses a search
engine to look for about 600 problem words, such as ``guarantee''
and ``promise,'' in outgoing e-mail from a company's system.
</P>
<P>
   With ToolBelt, noncompliant messages automatically come to the
attention of administrators before they are sent, avoiding rule
violations but without the need for a time-consuming physical
review of messages. The system can also create an archive of
messages for up to seven years that can be examined randomly or
specifically for noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
   Pecelli said the extranet that Amicus established for his
company two years ago also gives his brokers an opportunity to draw
on the firm's resources remotely at any time.
</P>
<P>
   A common characteristic of Amicus' customers, which make up
about 10 percent of all independent brokerage houses, is a thin
operating margin that doesn't allow for large-scale computing
applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect market for the type of out-source technology
that we provide, in part because their margins are so thin, they
don't have the resources to develop these technologies
themselves,'' said Passovoy. ``Under their own power they're not as
able to adopt technologies as fast as other industries.''

 &HT;    See you later, escalator
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Oh man, it's holiday time. And you know what
that means? Yes, there will be a crush of holiday shoppers. Yes,
there will be a plethora of mall workers pushing free sampples of
products you wouldn't buy if they paid you. Above all that, the
most annoying aspect of the holiday season is that there will be
crowded escalators. Escalators packed with anxious shoppers trying
to get to the big sale at Bath &AMP; Body Works. Escalators crammed
with annoying teens chatting away on their parents' cell phones
while munching on soft pretzels. Escalators jammed with elderly
mall walkers on their way to level two for a change of scenery.
Then, there's the most annoying aspect of holiday escalators: those
little punks (let loose by browsing parents) who insist on walking
down the ``up'' escalator. I know, this ritual is an age-old
holiday tradition, but tradition or not, it's totally annoying;
annoying enough to be declared Annoying Gadget of the Week.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the battle for mobile phones that include
wireless Internet access heating up, PrimeCo's latest consumer
model, the PCX-3500XL ($159 after rebate, www.primeco.com) is
curiously absent of Web access features. The company admits it's a
few months behind on the technology being rolled out by Sprint PCS.
What the 3500XL, a titanium gray flip phone made by Audiovox, does
have is a sleek feel at a feather-light 4.4 ounces, a hands-free
kit, editable phone rings and enough battery lifefor 120 minutes of
talk time.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ www.this.com _ If the idea of a ``safe''
Internet is about as appealing as a Stepford wives potluck,
this.com may not be the place for you. But if you're a parent and
you're worried about what your kids are viewing on the Internet
(and whether they've washed behind the ears), this.com provides
``filtered Internet access,'' the online equivalent of wearing a
condom. Links from this.com are guaranteed to be free of smut.
</P>
<P>
   www.thehungersite.com _ Feel like making a difference? Unlike
those annoying chain e-mails that promise to save a child's life if
you just forward a message to all your friends, this Web site
really does do charity work, and all it takes is a click from you.
At The Hunger Site, clicking a button will donate 1/4 cup of food
per sponsor to countries that need it. With the help of companies
such as Infospace, the click-through program is donating more than
50 tons of food a week to the United Nations World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   www.selectsmart.com _ SelectSmart takes the pain and agony out
of life decisions. Can't decide for whom to vote next November? Use
the Presidential Candidate Selector to find the candidate who
matches your political views when you answer a list of questions.
Want the best wine for an upcoming dinner? Answer the questions and
it'll match you with a suitable vintage. And best of all, you can
get your palm read by matching your hand with illustrations of palm
lines. A lifesaver for the indecisive.
</P>
<P>
   www.obitdetails.com _ It's never too late to think about death
(unless you're dead, of course), and if you're in a morbid mood, or
just want to honor a dead person you know, hop on to
obitdetails.com, an obituary listing site. For a one-time fee of
$145, you can post a lasting obituary that includes sound and video
clips. As the company says in its press mailing, ``Who cares if
you're not a celebrity? No matter your notoriety, everyone deserves
to be remembered.'' For those of who don't leave much of a legacy

 &HT;    Makings of a frugal funeral offered on Web

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   www.webcaskets.com _ We know, we know _ what kind of person
comparison-shops for a funeral? Well, according to this site, a
smart and frugal one. According to the site's frequently asked
questions, consumers routinely spend too much on funeral
arrangements. ``Be wary of funeral homes that do not have any
caskets priced below $2,000. This is a sure sign you are paying far
too much,'' webcaskets.com warns. Shop here to make quick shopping
out of an eternal resting place.
</P>
<P>
   MUST BUY: The Lone Star Art Casket, a casket emblazoned with a
picture of mesas, cacti, bluebonnets, the state flag and the Alamo,
$2,575 with shipping. Simply to die for. www.bn.com _ Most people
who buy books over the Internet have a preference: Amazon.com or
Barnes &AMP; Noble's Web site. But Barnes &AMP; Noble is upping the stakes
by offering one-day delivery in Manhattan, using courier and
hand-delivered services at no extra charge. While that doesn't mean
a whole lot right now, the experiment may spread to some of the
chain's 500 other locations, including Austin. So check out the
site now and start doing some comparison shopping in case that
happens.

   MUST BUY: ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' in softcover, $11.20 plus
shipping.

 &HT;    Keep Windows 2000 in mind when buying or upgrading
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While normal people are getting ready for the
holidays, the real geeks and wireheads among us have started
thinking about getting home computers ready for Windows 2000, the
coming edition of Windows that should be released early in the new
year.
</P>
<P>
   I've been using beta copies of 2000 for several months now. It's
not really fair to critique Windows based on test copies, since the
whole idea of a beta test is to find problems and bugs in the
software. But, all in all, it seems as if it will be (and it should
be) better than Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Based on my experience, here are some things that will help you
get ready for Windows 2000 if you're thinking of buying a new
computer or upgrading the one that you have.
</P>
<P>
   Memory: Windows 95 and 98 used memory a lot better than Windows
3.1, but both are still flawed. For technical reasons that would
take too long to explain, some computers running these versions of
Windows actually slowed down after much more than 64 megabytes of
RAM were installed. Windows 2000 is built on the more robust
backbone of Windows NT (the industrial strength version of Windows)
and handles memory a lot better. It also seems to need more memory.
I'd suggest 128 megabytes of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories: Not every accessory that you are now using with
Windows 95 or 98 will work with Windows 2000. That applies even to
brand-new devices. For instance, just weeks ago I got a demo
version of a new game controller that plugs into the joystick port.
It won't work with Windows 2000. A smart buyer would know in
advance, since the package clearly stated that the controller
wasn't compatible with Windows NT (and, as I said, that's the
framework Windows 2000 is built on). So if you're shopping for
accessories, check the package to make sure that they'll work with
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Software: It's the same story here. Not all of your software
will work with Windows 2000. When you install 2000, the program
does a good job of identifying the programs on its list of
incompatible programs.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a tip, though. Many of the programs that 2000 flagged as
incompatible ran just fine, so don't delete those old programs
without actually trying them. And when you buy new software, look
on the package to make sure that it's Windows 2000 compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the important ``gotchas'' to think about. But there
are some other things to keep in mind. These apply to any computer
running Windows.
</P>
<P>
   USB: That stands for universal serial bus port. Windows 98 and
Window 2000 support this technology, and it's a vast improvement
over the way things used to be. It's much easier to install new
equipment on a computer equipped with USB. You simply plug it in,
and it works. You can plug and unplug the device while the computer
is running, without a bunch of rebooting and reconfiguring. I've
literally never had a moment's trouble installing a USB device. You
can be sure that your new computer will have USB ports. I highly
recommend that _ when you're buying a new scanner, printer or other
device _ you get the USB version.
</P>
<P>
   Video cards: Most people don't know what computer gamers have
understood for a long time. A good video card can speed up your
computer at least as much as going to the next-fastest processor
chip. Even if you're not a gamer, make sure the next video card you
buy has at least 16 megabytes of onboard RAM. My own video card has
32 megabytes of RAM and _ even on my now-antique 350-megahertz
Pentium II machine at home _ things fly.
</P>
<P>
   One last thing to keep in mind. Windows 98 will be around for a
while. There is no law that says you have to buy and install
Windows 2000. But, since most of us probably will move to it
someday, it's smart to keep its requirements in mind when you buy a
new computer or upgrade the old one.

 &HT;    Forecast is for better weather sites
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a reason everyone talks about the weather.
It's one of the things we all have in common.
</P>
<P>
   Weather sites on the Web are among the most frequently
bookmarked. And Atlanta's own Weather Channel has one of the most
popular sites in the nation. But since weather sites are one of the
largest categories on the Web, there are plenty of choices. With
icy and snowy weather probable in the next few months, this is a
good time to see what's out there.
</P>
<P>
   Since Weather.com (www.weather
</P>
<P>
   .com) is the king of the hill, we'll start there. Since most of
us tend to check the weather in the same cities each time _ your
hometown, where you live now, places where relatives live, cities
you visit _ a long-standing feature of the site makes a lot of
sense. You can customize the start page so that every time you
visit, you'll get the weather for cities you select (other features
can be customized, too, but this is the most useful one).
</P>
<P>
   One good change at this site is the completeness of the weather
report. Frankly, the information was once a little skimpy _ the
day's weather was reduced to little more than an icon that showed a
sunny day, or cloudy one, etc., and the predicted highs and lows.
There's more detail now, and that's helpful. Even more detail would
be better. It exists, but you have to select the ``detailed
forecast'' link to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Another excellent source of weather information comes from that
Web standby, Yahoo. Just go to weather.yahoo
</P>
<P>
   .com, and checking the local forecast is easy. Simply type in
the ZIP code (or the name of the city) and you'll get a complete
summary (furnished by Weathernews Inc.).
</P>
<P>
   A standout feature of this site can be tested by following the
link to the long-range forecast. You'll be taken to www
</P>
<P>
   .weatherplanner.com/ (or you can bypass the Yahoo site and go
there yourself) and be able to get a 30-day forecast for your area.
That's a pretty ambitious goal (for instance, the weather for my
neighborhood says that Christmas Day will be clear with highs in
the 50s to 60s. But it's at least as good as guessing and sort of
fun).
</P>
<P>
   The Weather Underground (www
</P>
<P>
   .wunderground.com) site offers some of the most complete weather
information on the Web. If you want to know absolutely everything
about the weather in a city _ literally down to the phase of the
moon, dew point and visibility _ this is a good place to bookmark.
</P>
<P>
   Another unique feature of the site is its ability to translate
the weather news into more than 40 languages. So whether you want
to read the Des Moines weather in Arabic, Afrikaans or Korean, it's
as simple as just using the pull-down menu to change the language.
</P>
<P>
   You can't talk about weather forecasts without considering the
nation's prime source: the National Weather Service. The Weather
Service is, of course, represented on the Web. You'll find it
(among other places) at www.wrh.noaa.gov
</P>
<P>
   /wrhq/nwspage.html.
</P>
<P>
   From that page, you can select from a long list of links that
will take you to various regional centers and also to some of the
Weather Service's specialized weather centers. For instance, you
can go to the National Hurricane Center, various maritime and
aviation centers and the Storm Prediction Center. A serious student
of the weather, or just a person who enjoys knowing more than is
needed, can spend hours here.

 &HT;    Store data online, at no cost
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you've ever needed to wipe your hard disk
completely clean and didn't have a Zip drive or other offline
storage device for stashing the information, you already know what
a hassle it is to back up all that data onto floppy disks.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a way to get 300 megabytes of storage for free. You
can use it for whatever you like, and the uses are limited to times
when you need to reformat the disk.
</P>
<P>
   This storage is furnished by a Web site, so that means that your
most precious information would remain safe, even if your computer
were destroyed by fire. Businesses have used off-site storage for
years, and the Internet is filled with sites that offer storage.
</P>
<P>
   But this site is different in a couple of ways. You get the 300
megabytes of storage free, and this site is aimed directly at
Macintosh owners. Simply go to the site at FreeMacSpace.com,
register and the space is yours.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the site's organizer had to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual hard drives for the Macintosh community are a perfect
match for Apple's iMac users and for the large community of
designers and artists who use high-end Macs,'' said Ari Freeman,
co-founder and chief strategic officer at FreeDiskSpace.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the iMac, iBook, G3 and G4 computers do not ship with a
floppy drive, our virtual hard drives provide these users with an
easy and free solution to securely store and, if they choose, share
any type of file they wish. Mac-based designers who commonly work
with large files will find storing, sharing and collaboration of
files to be as simple as turning on their computers.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also advertises itself as a place to stash important
files in case the Y2K glitch bites. But as a Macintosh owner, you
are almost certainly safe. Unlike PCs, most Macintoshes are
Y2K-proof. Apple says its recent models are safe until 29940 A.D.,
and chances are you'll need a new Mac by then.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, working antiques like the Apple II may not be so
bulletproof. Some of these machines are still doing honest work. If
you're using one, you may want to back up your information, just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, although you're probably safe from Y2K woes, some of you
may enjoy the New Year more if you've backed up your most important
files and stored them away on this site.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced virtual hard drives _ at separate
sites _ for other systems including PC, Linux and personal digital
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The site promises good security as far as protecting your
information.

 &HT;    MP3.com, Slate flourished during a notable Web year
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ End-of-the-year lists are as inevitable as death and
taxes. At the end of the century, it's a good thing the Web isn't
1,000 years old or even 10. This subjective list of 1999's notable
Web achievements won't make anybody think back further than
January.
</P>
<P>
   Upset of the year: MP3.com (www.mp3.com)
</P>
<P>
   It's just amazing how one Web site can single-handedly turn the
music industry upside down. MP3.com's extensive collection of
downloadable digital music, combined with the music industry's
initial reluctance to release music for sale via the Web, created a
demand for digital music that can no longer be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Most improved player: Slate (www.slate.com)
</P>
<P>
   After so much hype, so many misfires and a failed subscription
plan, Slate has finally found its way in the online world. Its
thoughtful political coverage and stable of experienced writers
have transformed Slate from Microsoft's and Editor Michael
Kinsley's goofy hobby to a Web site actually worth reading. Expect
sparks to fly as election 2000 shifts into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Best use of a chat room: Atlanta office worker ``Hey Y'all''
</P>
<P>
   While hiding under her desk in an Atlanta office building, Leigh
Frey signed on to the CNN current events chat room using the
pseudonym ``Hey Y'all.'' She used the chat room to get the latest
news about gunman Mark O. Barton's shooting spree in the Piedmont
Center office complex where she worked. Other chatters were
skeptical but provided needed information and words of
encouragement. Proof that community on the Web isn't just about
geeky teen-age boys looking for love.
</P>
<P>
   Best search engine that just searches: (www.google.com)
</P>
<P>
   It's just one page with a box to type in your query. No free
e-mail, no online shopping, no chat rooms, no message boards.
There's nothing to do here but search the Web, and the results are
good. You click, you search, you read. Portals are like, you know,
so five minutes ago.
</P>
<P>
   Best place to try and make a quick buck: eBay (www.ebay.com)
</P>
<P>
   From human body parts to souvenirs of the World Trade
Organization riots in Seattle, eBay proves that Web auctions are an
endless source of fascination, a great source for obscure
collectibles and an outlet for every scam artist around. EBay
catches most of them, but not before the media have a field day.
</P>
<P>
   Best example that two heads really are better than one _ and get
more attention, too: MindSpring/EarthLink, EarthLink/MindSpring
merger
</P>
<P>
   I say tomato, you say tomahto; however you look at it, it's
still going to be the second-largest Internet service provider
after behemoth America Online. With 3 million subscribers and a
prototype deal with AT&AMP;T for open access to cable lines, the
MindSpring/EarthLink combo may have extended the potential lifespan
of the ISP well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Best candidate for induction into the Silicon Valley Boys Club:
CMGI President David Wetherell
</P>
<P>
   When Lycos tried to merge with Barry Diller and Ticketmaster,
majority stockholder Wetherell was there to quash the deal. He then
snapped up failing search engine AltaVista and reinvented it as a
shopping and services site, and he's not done yet. The
Massachusetts businessman proves you don't need offices in Palo
Alto to play the Web game and win.
</P>
<P>
   Best argument for holiday shopping at the mall:
</P>
<P>
   e-toys.com, Toysrus.com, kbkids.com. (tie)
</P>
<P>
   Not even little Cindy-Lou Who could save millions of online
shoppers from frustration, disappointment, out-of-stock items and
poor customer service. Why toy retailers were unprepared for one of
their biggest seasons of the year is a mystery they need to solve
before December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Best online example that war is hell: The first-person accounts
of the war in Kosovo from Belgrade radio station B92
(www.freeb92.net)
</P>
<P>
   Many called the war in Kosovo the first Internet war as millions
of Bosnians took to their laptops and described the NATO bombing of
Belgrade. Their stories were often-chilling accounts of life during
wartime that won't be easily forgotten.

 &HT;    Software helps stockbrokers catch false claims in e-mail
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A sure thing!
</P>
<P>
   A guaranteed winner!
</P>
<P>
   100 percent safe!
</P>
<P>
   These words make frequent appearances in spam, the junk e-mail
we hate to get, usually followed by some supposedly unbeatable
offer to invest in a stock. Often, it's not clear where the
messages come from.
</P>
<P>
   But for reputable stockbrokers, they are words to avoid. In
fact, it is illegal for registered representatives of brokerage
houses to use phrases such as ``a sure thing'' in cyberspace,
according to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
National Association of Securities Dealers, which last year issued
a notice to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers, who have been notoriously slow to accept the influence
of the Internet on their business, now have a huge burden: watching
e-mail to make sure the wrong words aren't delivered into a
client's inbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the (regulators) have said, `You've got to watch
over e-mail,''' said Edward Pecelli, a broker with Horner, Townsend
and Kent, a 1,400-representative brokerage in Horsham, Pa. ``You've
got to put a surveillance process into place.''
</P>
<P>
   That burden has become an opportunity for Amicus Inc., an Austin
software company that designs Web-based tools for financial
services companies, especially independent brokerages. Packaging
them with extranets, Amicus began selling a surveillance system
that throws up virtual red flags when noncompliant language appears
in an e-mail from a representative to a client.
</P>
<P>
   While Amicus has sold the application to only about a half-dozen
of its roughly 30 clients, the company is predicting it will become
more popular as more companies are faced with audits of their
communications by the SEC. Bigger investment houses have charged
their internal information technology departments with developing
similar applications.
</P>
<P>
   But the independent broker-dealers that are Amicus' customers
often can't afford a big outlay to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They now get stuck with a job they weren't prepared to deal
with,'' said Dennis Passovoy, chief executive of Amicus. ``When
they get audited, they get told, `Figure out a way to deal with it.
Either come up with a manual system or come up with an automated
system.' That's when we get the phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   Misrepresentations by salespeople were the most common cause for
complaints that investors made to the SEC last year, and electronic
misrepresentations are becoming increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   But for years, e-mails from brokers to clients were not governed
by the same rules that prohibit written statements that claim a
guaranteed return on investment. Typically, brokers submit copies
of letters to their compliance departments to ensure they are not
violating rules that forbid promising that a risky investment will
pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Amicus' ToolBelt 98-11 _ named for NASD Notice 98-11, which
alerted the securities industry to the rule change _ uses a search
engine to look for about 600 problem words, such as ``guarantee''
and ``promise,'' in outgoing e-mail from a company's system.
</P>
<P>
   With ToolBelt, noncompliant messages automatically come to the
attention of administrators before they are sent, avoiding rule
violations but without the need for a time-consuming physical
review of messages. The system can also create an archive of
messages for up to seven years that can be examined randomly or
specifically for noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
   Pecelli said the extranet that Amicus established for his
company two years ago also gives his brokers an opportunity to draw
on the firm's resources remotely at any time.
</P>
<P>
   A common characteristic of Amicus' customers, which make up
about 10 percent of all independent brokerage houses, is a thin
operating margin that doesn't allow for large-scale computing
applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect market for the type of out-source technology
that we provide, in part because their margins are so thin, they
don't have the resources to develop these technologies
themselves,'' said Passovoy. ``Under their own power they're not as
able to adopt technologies as fast as other industries.''

 &HT;    PC World has primer on finding lost data
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Have you ever turned on your computer and _ after
moments of clicking and grinding _ found yourself facing a blank
screen or a frightening error message?
</P>
<P>
   More and more of our lives _ everything from banking records to
personal correspondence _ is stored on that computer hard disk.
That's why the January 2000 issue of PC World is worth checking
out. You'll find tips on what to do ``When Good Data Goes Bad.''
The magazine covers various methods for recovering data from a
dying hard disk, as well as recovering corrupted files.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have a friend who is new to the computer world, or is
expecting his or her first computer as a holiday gift? Pick up the
special holiday issue of Family Circle/PC World Computers Made
Easy. This issue is aimed at novice computer users. Even for
veterans, there are articles of interest, including ratings of the
best PCs in the low-price range, last-minute holiday gift
suggestions and ways to keep your information private when you surf
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular basketball games in the computer world
is ``NBA Live'' from EA Sports. A new edition of that game _ ``NBA
Live 2000'' _ is just out. It's available for PlayStation and
Nintendo 64. Some of the nifty new features include the ability to
challenge Michael Jordan for a little one-on-one. You'll also be
able to customize the on-screen players _ almost a build-a-person
kit _ changing the way a face looks, altering hairstyles and skin
color, and even changing eye colors.
</P>
<P>
   Also new on shelves is ``South Park, Chef's Luv Shack,'' for PC
systems. This game from Aklaim is based on the popular TV show.
Parents should note that _ as is true in the TV show _ the content
may be objectionable for some. But if the TV show is on your
family's approved list, the game should be fine, too. You'll need a
Pentium II running at 233 megahertz with 64 megabytes of RAM to
enjoy the game, although it should run on systems as sluggish as a
Pentium166.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever received an e-mail and wanted to find out a little
more about the source? One way is to look up the domain name.
Finding out where the originating site is located can help. There's
a Web site at dedicated
</P>
<P>
   .rapidserver.com/whois.html that can provide some of this
information.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if stuff like anonymous e-mail is driving you crazy, maybe
you should drop in at www
</P>
<P>
   .allhealth.com/onlinepsych/. Besides some psychological mind
games, you'll also find various tests to check out your
personality, or lack of one.

 &HT;    64 Net-related business plans will be whittled to one winner
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite record online sales, few people except the
ones who run the pornography sites are making much money selling
stuff on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, venture capitalists are lending millions of dollars so
college graduates, and sometimes college dropouts, can test
e-commerce business plans.
</P>
<P>
   How can you tap that?
</P>
<P>
   Hummer Winblad partners, one of Silicon Valley's most respected
venture capital firms, is holding a business plan contest modeled
on one of our nation's greatest sports events: March Madness, the
NCAA basketball tournament, where 64 teams play their way down to
one champion.
</P>
<P>
   The contest, online at winbig.humwin.com, is soliciting business
plans from any student at any accredited school. The 64 best plans,
one per school, get to compete. The 16 finalists will have a chance
to present their plan to the Hummer Winblad folks March 23. The
winner will be named March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The idea must be Internet-related.
</P>
<P>
   THE MILLENNIUM AFTER NEXT
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago we had pretty clear ideas about what we thought
life in the 2000s would be like. The Jetsons pretty well nailed it:
cars that fly, robots that clean and meals that come in the form of
pills. None of which is all or even some of the rage yet.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe we can get better. One Web site,
www.brainticklers.com, is all about guessing what life will be like
in 3000.
</P>
<P>
   The site poses questions on issues divided by category,
including: our bodies, our cells; our planet; money and power;
technology; energy and travel; inner life; family life.
</P>
<P>
   You can search by topic, read a question and pose an answer that
stays on the site. That's one of the nicer things about the
Internet: Thanks to chat groups and message boards, the random
brilliance or random stupidity of people is given a kind of
permanence.
</P>
<P>
   One recent Q and A:
</P>
<P>
   Q: From mead to coffee, business beverages have gone from merry
to performance fuel. What will we drink at business meetings in
3000?
</P>
<P>
   A: Water.
</P>
<P>
   The site was started by Elizabeth Arnold, an entrepreneur,
writer, executive coach and feng shui consultant; and Rod
Beckstrom, chairman of a financial risk management systems company.
</P>
<P>
   A list of best of this and best of that sites
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Internet Life has ranked the 100 best Web sites for the
new year.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    IBM's 1480 ThinkPad puts whistles atop bells
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'm writing this on the finest laptop computer I've
ever used, but curiously a lot of the high-end bells and whistles
built into IBM's Model 1480 ThinkPad don't have anything to do with
computing.
</P>
<P>
   The 1480, apparently, has reached the limits of the mobile
computing envelope. Oh, I'm sure that you can get plenty of laptops
that run a little faster _ the 1480 is, after all, running on an
Intel Celeron chip of a mere 466 MHz _ but you'd be hard-pressed to
notice it.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a 6-meg hard drive, 14.5-inch LCD display with an ATI
video card that has 4 megabytes of RAM, 64 megs of memory, and a
DVD drive along with a floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   The modem is a Lucent Technologies V.90 model that achieved 48k
and better on my telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   None of that constitutes bells and whistles; it's just good
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the bells and whistles, my favorites first:
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of the lid, there's a little light. Turn it on in
the daylight, and you won't even see it. But turn it on in the
dark, and it provides just enough light to let you read the
keyboard. Now, you might think that's silly, and I probably would
have agreed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But this past summer I had to write an article on deadline in
the passenger seat of a car flying down Interstate 85 in the dead
of night. No problem, I suppose, for an accomplished typist, but
I'm not one of those, and I doubt a lot of laptop users are. The
National Security Agency would have been hard-pressed to decode the
results of that adventure. This little light would have been a
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Next is the Internet scroll bar, a big paddle kind of thing
right behind the small paddle things that serve as mouse buttons on
the deck in front of the keyboard. You can use this paddle in
conjunction with the mouse stick to scroll through Web pages
without having to stay on the scroll bars. That's very nice, but
why not extend it to internal applications as well?
</P>
<P>
   Then you've got the four color-coded buttons above the keyboard.
These are preset to use various functions of the Web services IBM
and Lycos have created, but you can customize them to do anything
you wish.
</P>
<P>
   There's a built-in microphone, and also a microphone jack.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the flashy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   At the front of the deck, protrudinga bit so it can still be
used when the computer is turned off and the lid is closed, are
controls and a little window to let you play music disks, or even
DVD movies, through the S-video output to a television set. Oh,
wow.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, at extra cost but what the heck, you can buy
optional covers for the 1480 in seven different colors, not all of
which, one assumes, are blue.
</P>
<P>
   Along with all of these wonders, of course you have the
inescapable evils of all laptops: disagreeable cursor control
devices and a cramped keyboard. The video display can be viewed
quite well from any angle in any light. However, the brightness and
contrast controls had little, if any, effect on it.
</P>
<P>
   As mentioned, IBM has opted for the mouse stick in the middle of
the keyboard instead of the little trackball or the little panel
you diddle with your finger. I don't like any of these. There is,
of course, a standard mouse port for those situations in which you
can use one.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is less cramped than many, and most of the keys are
where you expect to find them. And, of course, you can plug in a
standard keyboard when you wish.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you have the price _ $2,200 _ which is roughly twice
what you might pay for the same features in a desktop, but about
half what a top-of-the-line laptop would have cost a couple of
years ago. Computing on the go will always command a premium, I
suppose.

 &HT;    Graphire mouse is fit and functional
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mouses _ or is it mice? _ that come with computers are
functional, but they can have problems.
</P>
<P>
   The cord gets tangled, the little rolling ball gets gummed up
and stops working smoothly and a mouse isn't a good tool for
drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Wacom Technology Corp. of Vancouver, British Columbia, is
marketing an inexpensive cordless mouse and pen set that gets
around those problems. The Graphire cordless system sells for about
$100 and incorporates many of the features of Wacom's more
expensive tools for computer graphic artists.
</P>
<P>
   The system is only compatible with recent computer systems. It
operates with a personal computer with serial port on Windows 95 or
later or Windows 4.0 or later. The Graphire version with USB
connections requires Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   For Macintoshes, an iMac with USB and Mac OS 8.5 or Power
Macintosh with USB port and Mac OS 8.0 or later are required.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of plugging the mouse into the computer as with a
regular setup, the mouse pad of the Graphire is connected. Because
the mouse pad doesn't move around much, the connecting cable
doesn't get tangled.
</P>
<P>
   The lightweight cordless mouse operates like any other mouse; as
you move it, the cursor on the screen moves. Wacom claims, though,
that the Graphire is two to three times more accurate than an
ordinary mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Graphire mouse also comes with a scrolling wheel that allows
you to move documents up and down on the computer screen. It has an
extra button that can be programmed.
</P>
<P>
   The pen that comes with Graphire also can be used with word
processing programs, but it's most useful in graphics applications.
It can be used in painting, photo editing, writing text longhand or
anything else you might do with a pen or paintbrush.
</P>
<P>
   The software that comes with Graphire includes Painter Classic,
which is supposed to emulate traditional art tools such as chalks,
oil paints and more.
</P>
<P>
   The product is available online direct from Wacom. The company
said it is also available at Comp USA stores. For ordering
information visit www.wacom.com or call (800) 922-6613.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Modern medicine incorporating tenets of old
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In 1900, medical scientists were learning
exciting new ways to prevent diseases through municipal sanitation
and vaccinations. A hundred years later, we are learning exciting
new ways to prevent diseases through diet, exercise and gene
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a century that saw the obliteration and taming of
many horrific illnesses and injuries, medicine is turning its
attention in many ways to some of the things it focused on 100
years ago. The age-old notions of preventing disease, enhancing the
body's own healing process, treating the mind and body as
intricately connected, and taking part in one's own health care are
coming back into vogue. And with them, so are unregulated quackery
and some terrifying medical mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Medicine certainly isn't abandoning the remarkable technological
advances that helped boost the average American lifespan from 47 to
76 years. It is merely shifting its aim of such life-saving weapons
as antibiotics, antiseptic surgery and harnessed radiation. It also
is broadening its definition of health beyond the absence of
disease or injury to include the presence of vitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our progress has taken us to a place where we're
rediscovering the value of ideas we may have discarded,'' says
psychiatrist Dr. David Bienenfeld of Good Samaritan Hospital and
Wright State University's School of Medicine. ``Ideas like
prevention, the mind-body connection.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the century when organized medicine went from knowing
very little about the disease process to thinking it knew almost
everything to realizing it still had much to learn. Some problems
cannot be explained by the germ theory, it turns out, and so not
everything is subject to pharmacological bombardment. What is it
about the body that explains why clean-living football player Brian
Piccolo died of lung cancer at 26 and chain-smoking baseball
manager Casey Stengel lived to 86?
</P>
<P>
   Western medicine is too sophisticated to use the term ``balance
of humours'' that described this enigma 150 years ago, and too
technical to acknowledge the system of energy channels that Chinese
medicine identifies as ``chi.'' But just as osteopathy, naturopathy
and chiropractic sprung up in the late 1800s on the foundation of
the body's own healing mechanism, medicine once again is exploring
the innate ability to heal or head off diseases as more promising
than science's ability to attack them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the only way you're going to really cure anything,''
says Joseph Mantil, Kettering Medical Center's director of nuclear
medicine. ``Because drugs can't cure. Even antibiotics really don't
kill an infection. They stop it from doing anything until your
immune system can kill it. They're buying time.''
</P>
<P>
   With antibiotics and other 20th-century marvels, ``We're down
the stream fighting off the damage,'' says Dr. Richard Reiling, a
Kettering surgeon. In the next medical paradigm, ``We've got to go
up the stream and see what's causing the damage.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no better example of applying new technology to those
old goals than gene therapy, which looms as the driving force
behind 21st-century medicine.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE GERM THEORY TO GENE THERAPY
</P>
<P>
   Twentieth-century medicine was shaped by the germ theory,
articulated by German scientist Robert Koch in an 1882 paper that
showed specific diseases are caused by specific micro-organisms.
</P>
<P>
   It was the germ theory that gave healers an identifiable enemy
and spawned an era of attack medicine often likened to military
assault, says James Edmonson, a professor of medical history at
Case Western Reserve University's med school in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The standard cancer therapy, for example, was ``If you see it,
wherever it is, cut it out,'' Reiling says. ``We've gotten over
that,'' and started approaching cancer through the body's immune
system.
</P>
<P>
   People generally think of gene therapy in terms of repairing the
defective human genes that cause cystic fibrosis or often trigger
breast cancer. But the application that excites doctors at least as
much is manipulating microbiotic genes in ways that help the immune
system fight off many cancers and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge revolution that's going to kill cancer cells,''
Mantil says. ``We've been doing chemotherapy for the last 50 years
with no significant improvement. A drug just can't get to all the
cancer cells. There are too many. But the immune system can. That's
what the immune system is designed for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for people without catastrophic illnesses, a suddenly
flourishing school of thought insists that bolstering the immune
system through healthy lifestyles ``is really the way to go,'' says
Dr. Mark Clasen, WSU's family medicine director. ``The benefits of
exercise, of laughter, of a significant spiritual dimension in
one's life, of nutrition'' are now embraced by mainstream medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, say alternative practitioners, is to stop
interfering with the immune system by attacking some unpleasant
symptoms it produces. Fevers, inflammation and the mucous
discharges of common colds are all signs the immune system is
working properly, says Dr. Judith Boice, a Portland, Ore.,
naturopath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colds do not require treatment,'' she says. ``They are the
treatment.'' Instead of using drugs to dry up congestion and cool
off fevers, she says people with colds are better served in the
long run by the herbal remedies and simple warm liquids that
accelerate the discharges ``rather than pushing it under the
carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   ANTIBIOTICS MEET THEIR MATCH IN AIDS
</P>
<P>
   American medical doctors ridiculed the immune-system approach
for much of this century because they truly believed they had
developed something better. They could kill the body's microscopic
invaders with drugs. When the first diphtheria vaccines of the
mid-1890s clearly curtailed the country's largest killer of
children, Edmonson says attack medicine had its first stunning
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The three decades after World War II, when new antibiotics and
vaccines kept arriving to wipe out our nightmares, ``were truly a
high point in medicine, and they raised people's expectations,''
Edmonson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we would be able to wipe out all diseases and
nirvana would occur,'' says Reiling, who has been practicing for 32
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then along came the AIDS virus,'' Edmonson says, ``and
suddenly the confidence that doctors had acquired was shaken to its
roots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We seemed to reach the end of the antibiotic era and lost
faith in these magic bullets,'' says Janet Golden, a medical
history expert at Rutgers University's Camden, N.J., campus. Even
vaccines were losing their luster in light of evidence that
flushing toilets and sanitary sewers were ``really the bedrock of
our transformed health in the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional medicine recently succeeded, as Edmonson pointed
out, in turning many AIDS cases into a chronic disease, incurable
but survivable like diabetes, but disillusionment is a wall that's
not easily papered over. Cancer still baffles medical science, and
practically every American knows of someone who has been from
doctor to doctor, looking for some way to explain hazy but
debilitating symptoms of chronic fatigue and achiness.
</P>
<P>
   Medicine has limited its mysteries to the marginal few percent,
compared with the vast majority late last century, but the
mysteries that remain are no less frightening than tuberculosis and
cholera epidemics of old. Two of every five Americans now has tried
some form of alternative medicine. About one-fifth of our health
care dollars goes to alternative practitioners, most of it not
covered by insurance, the federal government pays for research in
these fields and two-thirds of the traditional U.S. med schools
offer courses in such practices as acupuncture, herbal remedies and
mind-body medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legitimization of non-Western medical tradition in the
last 15 years is striking,'' says University of Rochester, N.Y.,
medical history Professor Theodore Brown. ``This is an interesting
broadening of treatment possibilities after a period in which the
boundaries had become very rigid.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PERSISTENCE OF
</P>
<P>
   ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES
</P>
<P>
   These alternative practices aren't new. As the limits of drugs
and surgery become apparent, today's disenchantment with
conventional medicine reminds historian Edmonson of 19th-century
challenges to the medical establishment. Medicine of the 1830s and
'40s was painful and dangerous, based on bloodletting and purging
in the belief that disease was caused by excesses of bodily fluids.
</P>
<P>
   So people tried other approaches. Dr. Samuel Hahnemann developed
homeopathy earlier in Germany after some of his children died from
ineffective and caustic medical treatment. He believed in
stimulating the immune system with diluted substances that caused
the same symptoms as an illness. That may not have helped people,
Edmonson says, but at least it didn't kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Osteopathy was founded on the belief that studying the
musculo-skeletal system more closely would shed light on the
healing process. Chiropractors believed skeletal misalignments
obstructed the healing process. Naturopaths embraced a variety of
healing strategies and believed plant-based medicines would be more
effective and less harmful than the tar, sulfur and petroleum of
establishment physicians.
</P>
<P>
   All these disciplines jostled with drug-based allopathic
medicine for supremacy in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   But within two decades, the allopathic medical doctors'
germ-killing arsenal of drugs had shot down their competitors.
M.D.s also flourished, says Golden, because painless and
infection-free surgery was a marvel that kept people alive by, say,
removing a ruptured appendix, because new insurance plans made
hospitalization affordable and nurses made it comfortable, and
because of unprecedented abilities to diagnose diseases and answer
the question, ``What's wrong with me?''
</P>
<P>
   Today's proliferation of medical alternatives is bringing with
it the dangers of unregulated practitioners, the mixed blessing of
self-care and the benefits of linking the mind with the body _ much
as it did 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most states actually stopped licensing physicians in 1833.
Jacksonian democracy of the time empowered commoners to challenge
established authority in medicine along with everything else,
opening the door to any quack with a door, a sign and a nail.
</P>
<P>
   The state's medical licensing returned in 1896 and now includes
osteopaths and chiropractors, but the only regulated practices that
might be considered alternative are massage therapy and dietetics.
There is no certification to separate the acupuncturist with three
years' training from the M.D. practicing acupuncture after taking
night classes.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal remedies and dietary supplements also have returned to an
era of ``buyer beware'' because of a 1994 federal law that removed
them from the Food and Drug Administration's oversight. The FDA was
created in 1906 because annual sales of impotent and even harmful
nostrums, elixirs and medicine-show concoctions had reached $75
million.
</P>
<P>
   SELF-CARE GROWS INTO AN INDUSTRY
</P>
<P>
   Patent medicine advertisements also went unregulated before
1906, which reminds Brown of today's Internet. The ``Jesus' Diet''
Web site is able to claim, without contradiction, that ``Urine is a
medicinal, cleansing, and nourishing food ... with a surprising
ability to cure an amazing variety of ills.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet also offers some advantages of self-care. It
makes scientific information available to people who don't have
easy access to medical specialists, much as the herbal recipe kits
of New England farmer Samuel Thompson made medicines available to
19th-century Americans who lived days away from a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Today's self-care is far broader, of course. Much of the public
has been ahead of established medicine on the value of good
nutrition and exercise, notions largely regarded as quackery 100
years ago. Along with drugs and surgery, Dr. Herbert Benson calls
self-care ``the third leg of health care's three-legged stool.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson is the Harvard cardiologist who became the father of
mind-body medicine 30 years ago. He demonstrated the connection
between stress and high blood pressure and proved the physical
benefits of meditation, biofeedback and his own stress-reducing
``relaxation response.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Benson also has shown the role of stress in other
heart disease, infertility, insomnia and clinical depression.
``Mind-body medicine as self-care is not alternative medicine. It's
scientifically proven,'' he says today. It can eliminate many of
the 60 percent to 90 percent of doctor visits that he attributes to
``the mind-body-stress realm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most exciting recent developments,'' Brown says,
``is that research has caught up with what astute clinicians have
been saying _ that there are connections between emotions and the
disease process, between mind and body.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sigmund Freud introduced psychoanalysis at the turn of the
century, he inadvertently created separate medical worlds for the
mind and the body. His intention was eventually to show the
connection between brain chemistry and mental and neurological
illnesses. But the relationship couldn't be proven until the past
10 years, when new PET scan images began displaying brain
chemistry. They revealed what might even be called ``an imbalance
of humours.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for the 80 percent of Americans without brain disorders,
this understanding shows promise for people who simply want to feel
better. Health is no longer a yes-or-no question, says Wright
State's Clasen, ``with so many chronic diseases people are
acquiring now because they don't die at 50.'' He says managing and
preventing those diseases are becoming the primary focus of primary
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``When prevention became prominent in the second half of the
19th century,'' Brown says, ``it really was a desperation move.''
Doctors realized they didn't have good medical options after a
person became sick. As prevention surfaces again now, Brown says it
is for entirely different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One is to enhance the quality of life, he says, ``to go beyond
whatever levels already have been achieved by the advances of
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The other is to save costs. Medicine never was so expensive
before. If American society cannot prevent more of the illnesses
that cost six figures to treat, we won't be able to afford the
extraordinary improvements medicine can offer. So we have become
desperate not to avoid the hopelessness of disease, but to take
advantage of all the hope that medical science is finally offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more things change, the more they remain the same,'' wrote
19th-century Frenchman Alphonse Karn. Even before his time, French
philosopher Voltaire had pointed out, ``The art of medicine
consists of amusing the patient while nature cures the disease.''

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Modern medicine incorporating tenets of old
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In 1900, medical scientists were learning
exciting new ways to prevent diseases through municipal sanitation
and vaccinations. A hundred years later, we are learning exciting
new ways to prevent diseases through diet, exercise and gene
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a century that saw the obliteration and taming of
many horrific illnesses and injuries, medicine is turning its
attention in many ways to some of the things it focused on 100
years ago. The age-old notions of preventing disease, enhancing the
body's own healing process, treating the mind and body as
intricately connected, and taking part in one's own health care are
coming back into vogue. And with them, so are unregulated quackery
and some terrifying medical mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Medicine certainly isn't abandoning the remarkable technological
advances that helped boost the average American lifespan from 47 to
76 years. It is merely shifting its aim of such life-saving weapons
as antibiotics, antiseptic surgery and harnessed radiation. It also
is broadening its definition of health beyond the absence of
disease or injury to include the presence of vitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our progress has taken us to a place where we're
rediscovering the value of ideas we may have discarded,'' says
psychiatrist Dr. David Bienenfeld of Good Samaritan Hospital and
Wright State University's School of Medicine. ``Ideas like
prevention, the mind-body connection.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the century when organized medicine went from knowing
very little about the disease process to thinking it knew almost
everything to realizing it still had much to learn. Some problems
cannot be explained by the germ theory, it turns out, and so not
everything is subject to pharmacological bombardment. What is it
about the body that explains why clean-living football player Brian
Piccolo died of lung cancer at 26 and chain-smoking baseball
manager Casey Stengel lived to 86?
</P>
<P>
   Western medicine is too sophisticated to use the term ``balance
of humours'' that described this enigma 150 years ago, and too
technical to acknowledge the system of energy channels that Chinese
medicine identifies as ``chi.'' But just as osteopathy, naturopathy
and chiropractic sprung up in the late 1800s on the foundation of
the body's own healing mechanism, medicine once again is exploring
the innate ability to heal or head off diseases as more promising
than science's ability to attack them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the only way you're going to really cure anything,''
says Joseph Mantil, Kettering Medical Center's director of nuclear
medicine. ``Because drugs can't cure. Even antibiotics really don't
kill an infection. They stop it from doing anything until your
immune system can kill it. They're buying time.''
</P>
<P>
   With antibiotics and other 20th-century marvels, ``We're down
the stream fighting off the damage,'' says Dr. Richard Reiling, a
Kettering surgeon. In the next medical paradigm, ``We've got to go
up the stream and see what's causing the damage.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no better example of applying new technology to those
old goals than gene therapy, which looms as the driving force
behind 21st-century medicine.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE GERM THEORY TO GENE THERAPY
</P>
<P>
   Twentieth-century medicine was shaped by the germ theory,
articulated by German scientist Robert Koch in an 1882 paper that
showed specific diseases are caused by specific micro-organisms.
</P>
<P>
   It was the germ theory that gave healers an identifiable enemy
and spawned an era of attack medicine often likened to military
assault, says James Edmonson, a professor of medical history at
Case Western Reserve University's med school in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The standard cancer therapy, for example, was ``If you see it,
wherever it is, cut it out,'' Reiling says. ``We've gotten over
that,'' and started approaching cancer through the body's immune
system.
</P>
<P>
   People generally think of gene therapy in terms of repairing the
defective human genes that cause cystic fibrosis or often trigger
breast cancer. But the application that excites doctors at least as
much is manipulating microbiotic genes in ways that help the immune
system fight off many cancers and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge revolution that's going to kill cancer cells,''
Mantil says. ``We've been doing chemotherapy for the last 50 years
with no significant improvement. A drug just can't get to all the
cancer cells. There are too many. But the immune system can. That's
what the immune system is designed for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for people without catastrophic illnesses, a suddenly
flourishing school of thought insists that bolstering the immune
system through healthy lifestyles ``is really the way to go,'' says
Dr. Mark Clasen, WSU's family medicine director. ``The benefits of
exercise, of laughter, of a significant spiritual dimension in
one's life, of nutrition'' are now embraced by mainstream medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, say alternative practitioners, is to stop
interfering with the immune system by attacking some unpleasant
symptoms it produces. Fevers, inflammation and the mucous
discharges of common colds are all signs the immune system is
working properly, says Dr. Judith Boice, a Portland, Ore.,
naturopath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colds do not require treatment,'' she says. ``They are the
treatment.'' Instead of using drugs to dry up congestion and cool
off fevers, she says people with colds are better served in the
long run by the herbal remedies and simple warm liquids that
accelerate the discharges ``rather than pushing it under the
carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   ANTIBIOTICS MEET THEIR MATCH IN AIDS
</P>
<P>
   American medical doctors ridiculed the immune-system approach
for much of this century because they truly believed they had
developed something better. They could kill the body's microscopic
invaders with drugs. When the first diphtheria vaccines of the
mid-1890s clearly curtailed the country's largest killer of
children, Edmonson says attack medicine had its first stunning
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The three decades after World War II, when new antibiotics and
vaccines kept arriving to wipe out our nightmares, ``were truly a
high point in medicine, and they raised people's expectations,''
Edmonson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we would be able to wipe out all diseases and
nirvana would occur,'' says Reiling, who has been practicing for 32
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then along came the AIDS virus,'' Edmonson says, ``and
suddenly the confidence that doctors had acquired was shaken to its
roots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We seemed to reach the end of the antibiotic era and lost
faith in these magic bullets,'' says Janet Golden, a medical
history expert at Rutgers University's Camden, N.J., campus. Even
vaccines were losing their luster in light of evidence that
flushing toilets and sanitary sewers were ``really the bedrock of
our transformed health in the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional medicine recently succeeded, as Edmonson pointed
out, in turning many AIDS cases into a chronic disease, incurable
but survivable like diabetes, but disillusionment is a wall that's
not easily papered over. Cancer still baffles medical science, and
practically every American knows of someone who has been from

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After 85 years of running the Panama Canal, the United
States will turn over the keys to the giant waterway. The country
of Panama will officially take control on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The canal is considered one of the major engineering
achievements of the 20th century. It slices across the 50-mile-wide
land bridge _ or isthmus _ that connects Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Ships save thousands of miles by taking a short-cut through the
canal. The canal connects the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.
Before the canal opened, they had to sail all the way around the
tip of South America, making their journeys much longer and more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   A ship traveling from New York to San Francisco saves 8,000
miles by taking the canal short-cut.
</P>
<P>
   The French were the first to try to build a canal. They were led
by Ferdinand de Lesseps, who became a legend after he constructed
the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal connected the Red Sea and the
Mediterranean Sea in 1870.
</P>
<P>
   But the French effort in Panama collapsed in 1889 due to poor
financial management and Panama's disease-ridden swamps. Some
20,000 workers died of malaria and yellow fever.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wanted to take up where the French left off.
But Panama was then part of the South American country of Colombia.
Colombia refused to sign a canal treaty with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1903, the people of Panama revolted from Colombia _ some say
with help from the United States _ and quickly signed the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was among the canal's
strongest backers. The ``big ditch'' took 10 years and employed
50,000 workers at the height of the job. It was finished in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 workers died in accidents or of disease. But a
famous American doctor named William Gorgas managed to wipe out
most of the tropical diseases that plagued the French. He did this
by controlling the mosquitoes that spread malaria and yellow fever.
</P>
<P>
   After the canal opened, Panama and the United States often
bickered over its control. In 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter _
who once served as Georgia's governor _ signed two treaties turning
the canal over to Panama at the end of this century. Carter felt it
was important to let the Panamanians control the most important
piece of property in their own country.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans oppose the treaties, fearing the canal might be
poorly maintained or even fall under the control of a hostile
nation. But the proud Panamanians insist they will run the canal
safely and fairly.
</P>
<P>
   The giant ditch is still a vital trade link today, carrying
about 5 percent of all the world's shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Some 13,000 ships pass through the canal each year. They carry
everything from cars and television sets to raw materials like
petroleum, ore and lumber.
</P>
<P>
   The ships pay a total of about $600 million per year in tolls to
use the canal.
</P>
<P>
   FACTS ABOUT THE PANAMA CANAL:
</P>
<P>
   Length: 50 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum ship size: 106 feet wide by 965 feet long with a draft
of 39.5 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Canal work force: 9,000 workers, 95 percent of them Panamanian.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cost in human life: Estimated at 25,000, including 20,000 during
the French effort who died mostly of malaria and yellow fever.
</P>
<P>
   Panama Canal Zone:10 miles wide, it once included 12 U.S.
military bases and 7,000 buildings. All have now been turned over
to the Panamanian government.

 &HT;    Attacking `soft money'
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Presidential candidates Bill Bradley and John McCain
pledged last week not to use ``soft money'' in their campaigns if
they are chosen as their parties' nominees. Bradley is a Democrat
and a former New Jersey senator. McCain is a Republican and an
Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   To help keep a presidential election fair, there are rules about
how much money a person can give to a candidate. Companies and
labor unions are not allowed to donate money directly to a
candidate, explains Sharon Snyder of the Federal Election
Commission. The commission regulates how money is spent during
elections.
</P>
<P>
   However, a person or company can give an unlimited amount of
money to a political party, such as the Democrats or Republicans.
That money given to a political party is called ``soft money.''
Although soft money can't be spent directly on a presidential
candidate, those candidates can reap benefits from it. For example,
the party can run ads for a particular issue a candidate supports,
like the environment. The party also can run ads to encourage their
party members to vote.
</P>
<P>
   There are many people who would like to see soft money banned in
elections because they think it allows rich companies and rich
people to influence our leaders.
</P>
<P>
   PHONEY-MONS CAN FOOL YOU
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon card traders beware! If Pikachu looks a little funny,
you might have purchased an impostor.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials and Nintendo of America, the producer
of the cards and toys, say counterfeiting has become a problem,
especially during the holiday season. People are selling fake cards
and plush toys.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo officials suggest you hold the cards up to the light to
make sure they're real. If you can see through to the other side,
they're probably fake. In addition, counterfeit cards are often
printed on cheaper, thinner paper that bends or ``crinkles.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTRE DAME ON PROBATION
</P>
<P>
   For the first time ever, Notre Dame's football team was placed
on probation because of gifts, money and trips given players by a
former booster.
</P>
<P>
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association stripped the team
of two scholarships and put it on two years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame remains eligible for postseason bowl games. Its
multimillion-dollar TV contract with NBC is not affected.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA announcement ended an almost two-year investigation
into the relationship between a former booster and up to a dozen
players. The booster has admitted spending some of the more than
$1.2 million she embezzled from her former employer on players.
</P>
<P>
   The university did not have a comment.

 &HT;    Graphire mouse is fit and functional
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mouses _ or is it mice? _ that come with computers are
functional, but they can have problems.
</P>
<P>
   The cord gets tangled, the little rolling ball gets gummed up
and stops working smoothly and a mouse isn't a good tool for
drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Wacom Technology Corp. of Vancouver, British Columbia, is
marketing an inexpensive cordless mouse and pen set that gets
around those problems. The Graphire cordless system sells for about
$100 and incorporates many of the features of Wacom's more
expensive tools for computer graphic artists.
</P>
<P>
   The system is only compatible with recent computer systems. It
operates with a personal computer with serial port on Windows 95 or
later or Windows 4.0 or later. The Graphire version with USB
connections requires Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   For Macintoshes, an iMac with USB and Mac OS 8.5 or Power
Macintosh with USB port and Mac OS 8.0 or later are required.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of plugging the mouse into the computer as with a
regular setup, the mouse pad of the Graphire is connected. Because
the mouse pad doesn't move around much, the connecting cable
doesn't get tangled.
</P>
<P>
   The lightweight cordless mouse operates like any other mouse; as
you move it, the cursor on the screen moves. Wacom claims, though,
that the Graphire is two to three times more accurate than an
ordinary mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Graphire mouse also comes with a scrolling wheel that allows
you to move documents up and down on the computer screen. It has an
extra button that can be programmed.
</P>
<P>
   The pen that comes with Graphire also can be used with word
processing programs, but it's most useful in graphics applications.
It can be used in painting, photo editing, writing text longhand or
anything else you might do with a pen or paintbrush.
</P>
<P>
   The software that comes with Graphire includes Painter Classic,
which is supposed to emulate traditional art tools such as chalks,
oil paints and more.
</P>
<P>
   The product is available online direct from Wacom. The company
said it is also available at Comp USA stores. For ordering
information visit www.wacom.com or call (800) 922-6613.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: My boyfriend wants an alarm clock for
Christmas that displays the time on the ceiling. His grandmother
used to have one. He is not sure what brand his grandmother's was
or where she got it. I remember seeing these some years back but
have not been able to find one. I hope to put this in his stocking
for Christmas _ do you have any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   _ Stephanie Bertagna
</P>
<P>
   A: Hammacher Schlemmer stocks ceiling projector clocks ($59.95)
that run on batteries. Call (800) 233-4800 to order, or shop from
your keyboard at www.hammacher.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have some relatives in Minnesota who want me to send them
barbecue from Kreuz Market in Lockhart. Unfortunately, the folks at
Kreuz do not ship, so I am trying to figure out how to safely ship
barbecue up to the frozen northland. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Dan Kinnunen
</P>
<P>
   A: When your taste buds crave Kreuz's, nothing else will do.
Here is the preferred packing method from Kay Welch, owner of
Mailboxes Etc., who has shipped everything from a frozen coiled
rattlesnake to a 44-inch Spanish sword: Wrap the barbecue in foil.
Freeze it solid. Enclose in sealable plastic bags (two if
possible). Pack in a Styrofoam cooler with a small amount, about 5
pounds, of dry ice. Pad with packing peanuts and overnight the box.
The overnight charge on a 10-pound box will be expensive (but for
your relatives, why not?). Q: I bought a Reed &AMP; Barton bell in 1979
for my wife during the holidays. It had ``Christmas 1979'' engraved
on it. Who handles these bells and where can I order one? My wife
wants one dated 1999 since it is 20 years since we got married, and
I would like to give her one. Merry Christmas. _ T.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: What a nice gift! Try silversuperstore.com or (800) 426-3057.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it considered poor taste to invite people to a shower who
will not be invited to the wedding service and reception? _ B.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Only those invited to a wedding are eligible for shower
invitations. Many wedding books agree, including ``The Knot's
Complete Guide to Weddings in the Real World'' by Carley Roney.
Exception? If the wedding is an immediate family affair on Nevis
and showers are the only way to include friends in the nuptial
festivities. It is the bride's duty (one of many) to approve all
invitation lists so guests will not think they have only been
invited to give great gifts. Invitations should be spread around _
so no one is over- or under-invited.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Help me find a recipe for Amish Friendship Bread. It is made
with an old-fashioned starter that undergoes a 10-day process of
sitting, stirring, and adding a cup each of milk, sugar and flour
on certain days. I've misplaced my recipe (which ironically had
instant pudding in the final mix). I have no idea where to
``start.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jennifer Clitheroe
</P>
<P>
   A: Start with a batch of starter: This recipe is courtesy of the
Bon Appetit Cooking School: Use equal parts flour, sugar and milk
(1 cup each, for instance). Let set at room temperature in a jar
three times larger than the amount of mixture. Cover with
cheesecloth and stir with a wooden spoon once a day. Let sit for
one week before you use it. Do not use metal spoons or containers
and don't refrigerate.

 &HT;    Panama to take control of its biggest asset _ the Panama Canal
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After 85 years of running the Panama Canal, the United
States will turn over the keys to the giant waterway. The country
of Panama will officially take control on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The canal is considered one of the major engineering
achievements of the 20th century. It slices across the 50-mile-wide
land bridge _ or isthmus _ that connects Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Ships save thousands of miles by taking a short-cut through the
canal. The canal connects the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.
Before the canal opened, they had to sail all the way around the
tip of South America, making their journeys much longer and more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   A ship traveling from New York to San Francisco saves 8,000
miles by taking the canal short-cut.
</P>
<P>
   The French were the first to try to build a canal. They were led
by Ferdinand de Lesseps, who became a legend after he constructed
the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal connected the Red Sea and the
Mediterranean Sea in 1870.
</P>
<P>
   But the French effort in Panama collapsed in 1889 due to poor
financial management and Panama's disease-ridden swamps. Some
20,000 workers died of malaria and yellow fever.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wanted to take up where the French left off.
But Panama was then part of the South American country of Colombia.
Colombia refused to sign a canal treaty with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1903, the people of Panama revolted from Colombia _ some say
with help from the United States _ and quickly signed the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was among the canal's
strongest backers. The ``big ditch'' took 10 years and employed
50,000 workers at the height of the job. It was finished in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 workers died in accidents or of disease. But a
famous American doctor named William Gorgas managed to wipe out
most of the tropical diseases that plagued the French. He did this
by controlling the mosquitoes that spread malaria and yellow fever.
</P>
<P>
   After the canal opened, Panama and the United States often
bickered over its control. In 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter _
who once served as Georgia's governor _ signed two treaties turning
the canal over to Panama at the end of this century. Carter felt it
was important to let the Panamanians control the most important
piece of property in their own country.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans oppose the treaties, fearing the canal might be
poorly maintained or even fall under the control of a hostile
nation. But the proud Panamanians insist they will run the canal
safely and fairly.
</P>
<P>
   The giant ditch is still a vital trade link today, carrying
about 5 percent of all the world's shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Some 13,000 ships pass through the canal each year. They carry
everything from cars and television sets to raw materials like
petroleum, ore and lumber.
</P>
<P>
   The ships pay a total of about $600 million per year in tolls to
use the canal.
</P>
<P>
   FACTS ABOUT THE PANAMA CANAL:
</P>
<P>
   Length: 50 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum ship size: 106 feet wide by 965 feet long with a draft
of 39.5 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Canal work force: 9,000 workers, 95 percent of them Panamanian.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cost in human life: Estimated at 25,000, including 20,000 during
the French effort who died mostly of malaria and yellow fever.
</P>
<P>
   Panama Canal Zone:10 miles wide, it once included 12 U.S.
military bases and 7,000 buildings. All have now been turned over
to the Panamanian government.

WHO INVENTED `Y2K' -- AND WHY DID IT BECOME SO POPULAR?

<P>
   &UR; By TED ROSE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Y2K was born on Monday, June 12, 1995, at 11:31 p.m. It was
delivered in the middle of an otherwise unintelligible e-mail, a
contribution to an Internet discussion group of computer geeks
exploring the millennium bug long before most people were surfing
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The efficiency of the term is undeniable--``Y'' for ``year,''
the number ``2,'' and ``K'' for ``thousand'' (from the Greek
``kilo'')--and it eventually caught on.
</P>
<P>
   But its creator remained unidentified until just over a year
ago, when someone performed the equivalent of a computer paternity
test by searching the discussion group's archives for the term's
first use.
</P>
<P>
   The father of the phrase is a 52-year-old Massachusetts
programmer named David Eddy, who's now the president of a Y2K
consulting business. ``People were calling it Year 2000, CDC
(Century Date Change), Faddle (Faulty Date Logic),'' Eddy says.
``There were other contenders. (Y2K) just came off my fingertips.''
</P>
<P>
   But what made Y2K flourish while its siblings withered. S.B.
Master, who runs a naming company called Master-McNeil (great
name!) and who has helped name products for clients including Sun
Microsystems and 3Com, performed her own ``linguistic analysis'' of
Y2K and promptly listed six reasons why the term holds such appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, she said, Y2K is efficient, since it uses just
three characters; similarly structured acronyms such as IBM, NBC,
and GTE are a staple these days.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it's gratifyingly symmetrical, with the two consonants
hugging that number in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the whole tradition of combining letters and numbers is a
venerated techie convention (think R2D2 and C3P0). The date-glitch
issue has obvious technical associations; thus there is a strong
connection between the term's appearance and its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that explains why we're not using, say, Y2M--which
simply replaces the consonant representing the Greek term for
thousand with the one for ``mille,'' its Latin counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K, Masters pointed out, is rhythmically superior. When Y2K is
analyzed as poetry, one sees a satisfying alternation of long and
short syllables: a diphthong (Y), followed by a monothong (2), and
a final, concluding diphthong (K). By contrast, Y2M ends with a
redundant monothong. Masters praised Y2K for its superior sound
production, noting that the term features an elegant plosive
progression, moving from soft (Y) to hard (2) to hardest (K). Y2M
retreats lamely with a soft ``M.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Masters lauded the term for the way its articulation
produces a satisfying movement to the inside of the mouth. The term
begins with a labial sound: the ``Y'' being formed with the lips.
The ``2'' is alveolar; it is produced at the middle of the mouth
when the tongue touches the roof. Finally, the ``K'' is velar,
forming in the back of the mouth. That progression sets Y2K far
apart from its competition.

   Y2K was born on Monday, June 12, 1995, at 11:31 p.m. It was
delivered in the middle of an otherwise unintelligible e-mail, a
contribution to an Internet discussion group of computer geeks
exploring the millennium bug long before most people were surfing
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The efficiency of the term is undeniable--``Y'' for ``year,''
the number ``2,'' and ``K'' for ``thousand'' (from the Greek
``kilo'')--and it eventually caught on.
</P>
<P>
   But its creator remained unidentified until just over a year
ago, when someone performed the equivalent of a computer paternity
test by searching the discussion group's archives for the term's
first use.
</P>
<P>
   The father of the phrase is a 52-year-old Massachusetts
programmer named David Eddy, who's now the president of a Y2K
consulting business. ``People were calling it Year 2000, CDC
(Century Date Change), Faddle (Faulty Date Logic),'' Eddy says.
``There were other contenders. (Y2K) just came off my fingertips.''
</P>
<P>
   But what made Y2K flourish while its siblings withered. S.B.
Master, who runs a naming company called Master-McNeil (great
name!) and who has helped name products for clients including Sun
Microsystems and 3Com, performed her own ``linguistic analysis'' of
Y2K and promptly listed six reasons why the term holds such appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, she said, Y2K is efficient, since it uses just
three characters; similarly structured acronyms such as IBM, NBC,
and GTE are a staple these days.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it's gratifyingly symmetrical, with the two consonants
hugging that number in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the whole tradition of combining letters and numbers is a
venerated techie convention (think R2D2 and C3P0). The date-glitch
issue has obvious technical associations; thus there is a strong
connection between the term's appearance and its meaning.
</P>
<P>

ADDICTIVE, STATE-RUN VIDEO GAMBLING HAS HUGE SOCIAL COSTS

</P>
<P>
   Americans who don't gamble tend to view gambling as either
high-glitz casinos or megabucks lotteries--the only outlets the
media ever bother to notice.
</P>
<P>
   This narrow focus has protected the gambling industry, since
Americans are willing to accept a vice that is clearly separated
from the rest of society--as casinos are--or that offers a luscious
chance at the good life--as megabucks lotteries do.
</P>
<P>
   But three nascent grassroots anti-gambling campaigns in the West
could finally bring attention to the real issue in American
gambling, which has nothing whatsoever to do with casinos or
multimillion-dollar jackpots.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon and South Dakota, voters have gathered enough
signatures to place a constitutional amendment on the November 2000
ballot to outlaw ``video lottery.'' In Montana, activists are
preparing a similar November 2000 ballot measure to abolish video
gambling in that state.
</P>
<P>
   These initiatives aren't trying to eliminate all legal gambling
in their states--prohibition has been a disastrously unsuccessful
strategy in the gambling wars. Instead they are targeting only the
newest and most addictive form of American betting: ``convenience
gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns against convenience gambling mark the most
important development in gambling politics in years.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience gambling--a cheerful phrase for an alarming idea--is
premised on the notion that once gambling is legal, it should be
allowed just about everywhere: convenience stores, bars,
restaurants, bowling alleys, gas stations. Eight states permit
convenience gambling now. In several, including South Dakota and
Oregon, convenience gambling takes the form of a so-called ``video
lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who haven't played it, ``video lottery'' sounds like
some kind of high-tech Powerball--a lottery played with a computer
instead of a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``video lottery'' bears no relationship at all to a
lottery. It is simply a euphemism for state-run video poker
machines. Video poker is a popular casino game, a low-stakes
electronic version of five-card-draw poker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means minicasinos on Main Street that are run by the
government,'' says Tom Grey, head of the National Coalition Against
Legalized Gambling, which is organizing the three ballot
initiatives. Oregon, with about 3 million residents, owns 9,000
video poker machines that it places in 1,800 businesses. South
Dakota, with less than 1 million residents, has 8,000 gambling
machines in 1,400 locations. Montana has similar numbers of
machines in similar places, though the state does not run the
machines.
</P>
<P>
   These Western states introduced video gambling in the late '80s
and early '90s for one reason: It is a stupendously effective way
of parting citizens from their money. According to the North
American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, the average
American in a state with a lottery spends about $150 per year on
the lottery. But in the five states with video lotteries (Delaware,
West Virginia, and Rhode Island, along with South Dakota and
Oregon), average per capita lottery spending is about $600 per
year. In South Dakota, where lottery play is the highest in the
country, the average person spends an amazing $750 per year on the
state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   This generates monster revenues for both state and retailer.
South Dakota's government splits the revenue 50-50 with the bars
and restaurants. The state clears $90 million a year, which it is
using to cut property taxes 20 percent. (This money represents
about 5 percent of the total state budget.)
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, the state takes about two-thirds of the video lottery
revenues. That amounts to more than $230 million a year--about 3
percent of the budget--which the state spends on education, parks,
and salmon restoration. (''What do Oregon's public schools,
businesses, workforce, state parks and salmon all have in common?''
boasts the Oregon Lottery's home page. ``They all receive Lottery
profits to help them prepare for the future!'')
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, the state pockets 15 percent of video gambling
revenue in taxes, close to $40 million for the state's treasury.
(Both Oregon and South Dakota also run traditional lotteries, but
they are penny-ante games next to the video lottery: Only a quarter
of Oregon's lottery revenue comes from traditional lottery games,
and only 5 percent of South Dakota's does.)
</P>
<P>
   Video gambling delivers tax revenues, but it exacts huge social
costs. Video poker is known as ``video crack.'' Its rate of play is
dizzyingly fast--I once played more than 400 games of video poker
in an hour--and the flashing lights and flickering screens send
players into trancelike reveries.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other kinds of gambling, video poker discourages social
interaction. ``The machines suck people into the screen,'' says
Professor William Thompson, a gambling expert at the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas. ``You don't talk or socialize. You don't trade
stories. It is different from blackjack or even handle slots. These
are the most addictive of any gambling instrument we have today.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also voracious: A typical gambler addicted to blackjack
takes about 20 years from placing the first bet to bottoming out; a
gambler hooked on video poker needs less than three years.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Gamblers Anonymous chapters in Oregon has leapt
from three to 30 since video poker was introduced in 1992. (The
state itself recognizes the dangers of video poker: It forbids
video lottery advertising and allocates $3 million a year for
treating problem gamblers.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the small stakes in video lotteries encourage
addiction. Unlike lotteries, which offer low odds but spectacular
jackpots, video poker returns tiny but frequent pots. The state
relies on people playing the games over and over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   Addiction is not the only drawback of video gambling. It is a
cinch for kids to play video lottery machines, since they are often
found in businesses that kids frequent. Though it pays off more
often than lotteries, video poker offers poor odds compared with
most casino gambling, taking about 10 cents of every dollar bet
compared to 3 cents for casino slots.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, convenience gambling doesn't deliver the secondary
economic benefits that big gambling can. Because states limit the
number of machines that any one business can have, there are no
large casinos. So video lottery brings none of the ancillary jobs,
restaurants, and hotels that big casinos do.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, convenience gambling is emerging as the kind of
gambling that everyone can dislike, a juicy target for opponents
and a scapegoat for supporters of more acceptable kinds of
wagering. A bipartisan grassroots campaign in South Carolina just
eliminated its enormous video poker industry.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, half the parishes in Louisiana threw out video
gambling from their bars, restaurants, and truck stops. Several
years ago, the mayor of Las Vegas, who strongly supported casinos,
tried to root out convenience gambling from stores in her city. The
rest of the gambling industry treats convenience gambling like an
embarrassing cousin, routinely condemning it.
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota and Oregon have preserved a last best argument
against the critics: They can't afford to drop video lotteries.
Governors in both states have said they dislike relying on lottery
revenues to fund essential government services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has never been a big fan of the lottery and of
letting gambling policy drive public policy,'' says a spokesman for
Oregon's Gov. John Kitzhaber. But they are too scared of losing
their video lottery funds to endorse the ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   When the Oregon ballot initiative was floated earlier this year,
Kitzhaber endorsed the idea of abolishing the video lottery but
said the state needed a phaseout period to find replacement
revenue. So the activists added a three-year phaseout to their
ballot initiative. Kitzhaber now insists on a phaseout of at least
six years. ``He wants to get rid of it, but then he wants six
years. He sounds like an addict,'' says the anti-gambling
coalition's Grey.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon and South Dakota votes are a year away, and the
Montana signature-gathering has not yet begun. No one knows whether
even one of the initiatives can pass. The lottery retailers will
surely spend millions to keep their cash cow, and the governors are
likely to campaign for video gambling as well.
</P>
<P>
   But if the initiatives do squeak by, they may signal a new and
encouraging compromise, a recognition that just because gambling is
legal does not mean it has to be everywhere. If the initiatives
pass, after all, the states will retain their traditional
scratch-off and Powerball lotteries, and their Indian casinos will
continue to offer electronic gambling on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   These states will have gambling that is accessible, but not
universal; gambling that funds state government but does not hold
it hostage.

<P>
   Upstairs from Samson's Vitamins and Herbs, at the corner of 17th
and Church streets in northwest Washington, D.C., there's a funky
little eatery called the CyberSTOP Cafe. For $5 a half-hour you can
rent time on a PC or an iMac, while you sip an espresso and take in
the zany decor (chairs upholstered in leopard skin; a painting of
the Mona Lisa holding a coffee cup).
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore recently dropped by with some campaign staff and a few
reporters in tow, trudged up a narrow staircase, and had a campaign
aide shoot a video with a rented digital camera while he read a
letter to Bill Bradley. Then Gore downloaded the video onto one of
the CyberSTOP computers and e-mailed it to the Bradley campaign. He
put down a $20 tip and left.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, a gimmick. But all technological
breakthroughs begin as gimmicks. Does video campaign spam have a
future?
</P>
<P>
   Before answering that question, let's examine the somewhat
flimsy substance of Gore's message to Bradley. (This won't take
long.) In the video e-mail, Gore asked Bradley, with great
sobriety, about an ``oversight'' in Bradley's campaign literature
concerning the Medicare trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my part,'' the flickering image of Gore intoned, ``I have
proposed dedicating a significant portion of the budget surplus to
Medicare to extend the life of the trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bradley's campaign literature doesn't propose
similarly fencing off funds for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since independent experts agree that more resources will be
necessary to assure Medicare is strong for the future,'' Gore
continued, ``my question is, 'What specific measures do you propose
to compensate for not dedicating any of the surplus to strengthen
the Medicare trust fund?'''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Gore said that Bradley's plan to expand health
coverage to uninsured Americans (which is more ambitious than
Gore's plan) would bankrupt the Medicare trust fund unless Bradley
raised taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The relevance of this attack is severely compromised by the
reality that 1) Bradley had already admitted he might have to raise
taxes if circumstances warranted it; and 2) during his cybercafe
appearance, Gore himself told reporters that ``you have to have
flexibility on the fiscal side.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Gore's query, Eric Hauser, a spokesman for
Bradley, pointed out that Gore was no more willing than Bradley to
rule out a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   So much for substance. Turning to technological matters, Hauser
admitted that Bradley never got around to viewing Gore's e-mail.
Neither did Hauser and neither did anyone Hauser knew of in the
campaign, though they were familiar with its content from reading a
transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the video message got lost somewhere in the maw of
Bradley's campaign Web site. But obviously the video wasn't really
intended for Bradley; its target was the national press, a couple
hundred of whose members received e-mail press releases with the
video attached. Thanks to its novelty, the stunt won Gore some
coverage from The New York Times, Salon, Scripps Howard and a few
other outlets.
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't have to be a visionary to imagine where this might
go. The largest single expense that political campaigns face
nowadays is TV advertising. Gore, for instance, has dropped a
couple hundred thousand dollars on ads in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Video e-mailing is much cheaper. No, wait: Make that much, much,
much cheaper. Even figuring in Gore's $20 tip, the tab Gore ran up
sending his e-mail to Bradley and a bunch of reporters probably
came in at well under $100.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been even cheaper had Gore been able to use the
video camera already in his personal possession, but campaign
finance rules made that too difficult. Sending that same e-mail to
10 times as many people would have cost precisely the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Gore campaign has no grand plans to start spamming
unsuspecting citizens with video messages. It does plan, however,
to start sending video e-mails to people who have already indicated
on the campaign Web site that they'd like to receive such material.
They number in the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too great a leap to envision that in future
presidential races--perhaps even in this one--candidates will take
the next step and start buying lists of e-mail addresses so they
can send targeted video messages or advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   If ``push'' technology makes a comeback, such video ads could be
force-fed to the public at large at a cost that, compared to
current media buys, would probably be microscopic. These ads
probably wouldn't be as effective as conventional TV ads--remember,
most homes in the United States still aren't wired to the Internet.
But they'd be so much more cost-effective that they might still
transform the way campaigns do business.

the next step and start buying lists of e-mail addresses so they
can send targeted video messages or advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   If ``push'' technology makes a comeback, such video ads could be
force-fed to the public at large at a cost that, compared to
current media buys, would probably be microscopic. These ads
probably wouldn't be as effective as conventional TV ads--remember,
most homes in the United States still aren't wired to the Internet.
But they'd be so much more cost-effective that they might still
transform the way campaigns do business.

<P>
   Jan Bruckner, a professor of physical therapy at Thomas
Jefferson University in Philadelphia, heads across campus for a 10
a.m. appointment at the Human Performance Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   There, Gary Sylvester, one of Bruckner's students, nervously
waits. He has responded to her standing offer to examine any pupil
who complains of foot pain.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner begins the evaluation by asking his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-three,'' he announces.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of 23?'' says an older woman being treated for a serious
foot problem in the same lab. She listens jealously as Sylvester
explains that he runs 15 miles a week. His feet rub inside his
shoes, get raw around the toes and develop blisters.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester is far from alone. After years of clinical practice,
anthropological research and pioneering studies, Bruckner has
concluded that, biomechanically speaking, there's no such thing as
a normal human foot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead there is a spectrum of variations. Biologically, the
foot remains a work in progress, and it needs a lot more help from
the shoe industry than it's getting.
</P>
<P>
   If Sylvester hadn't bothered to show up today, his blisters
could have easily led to heel spurs and then to instability in his
ankles and knees. Eventually his minor complaint would have turned
into chronic pain. But because he is still young, a simple,
custom-made shoe insert designed by Bruckner will save his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner is a quiet, polite revolutionary driven to save the
world's feet. She has worked in relative obscurity, refining her
theories of the lowest human appendage for 15 years without major
grants or corporate backing. Her work has become a crusade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, after eight years of practicing physical therapy,
Bruckner wanted more information about the foot's biomechanics. To
that end, she enrolled in the physical anthropology program at
Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   She began reading old anthropology studies about bones and
joints, work considered irrelevant in the medical community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered something that they'd never taught me when I
studied anatomy in physical therapy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A few anthropologists had written about a wide range of shapes
and configurations of the human foot, variations that modern
textbooks never mention. In particular, the shape of the talus bone
_ directly above the heel and below the lower leg bone _ differs
widely among humans.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, these anomalies don't amount to much. Mechanically,
however, Bruckner suspected they might mean a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   The variations that seemed most important to her occur in a
joint called the subtalar, where the rounded talus bone fits into
the knobby calcaneus, or heel bone.
</P>
<P>
   The bones' irregular forms usually touch each other at two or
three distinct points called facets. Bruckner realized that a joint
with three facets would be stable and rigid, like a stool with
three legs, and would restrict motion and allow more shock to shoot
through the foot into neighboring joints.
</P>
<P>
   Two-faceted joints, on the other hand, would allow greater
flexibility. Three facets looked like trouble, but Bruckner wasn't
sure how that variation affected modern humans. It turned out that
nobody else knew either.
</P>
<P>
   To find out, Bruckner needed lots of feet. She began with the
dead. Because she taught in the physical-therapy department at the
university's medical school, she had access to the cadavers used in
anatomy classes. She dissected the feet of more than 30 bodies and
tallied more three-faceted than two-faceted joints.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing, she found that one-third of the bodies had a
two-faceted joint in one foot but a three-faceted joint in the
other, or vice versa, violating left-right symmetry found elsewhere
in the body. In her small but random sample, Bruckner didn't find a
single normal pair of feet.
</P>
<P>
   She began to wonder what happens to the knees, hips and lower
backs in people who have mismatched shock absorbers in their feet.
</P>
<P>
   To continue her research on the living without using surgery,
she developed a technique for wiggling patients' heels to reveal
three-faceted joints. But she still needed a live group of research
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner found them by chance when she filled in as a temporary
physical therapist with the Tohono O'odham (pronounced like autumn)
tribe of southern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Bruckner struck a deal with the tribe: She agreed to
work at the reservation's clinic without pay if she could examine
the feet of any willing member of the tribe. Because the O'odham
are a relatively homogeneous population, Bruckner half expected to
find almost no variations in their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're about as close to genetically isolated as you're going
to find in North America,'' she says. Instead, she found wide
deviation in the subtalar joints.
</P>
<P>
   She still needed a research pool more diverse than the O'odham.
In the winter of 1989, the Persian Gulf War delivered them almost
to her front door.
</P>
<P>
   As troops were shipped to the gulf, Bruckner went to work for
the U.S. Army at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana. She worked for
free, under the proviso that she could examine the healthy feet of
anyone on the base who volunteered for her research.
</P>
<P>
   Again she found plenty of variation _ and something else. If a
soldier had a three-faceted joint in one foot and a two-faceted in
the other, the odds for injury were higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was even more devastating than facet configuration,'' she
says, ``was asymmetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner finally had enough data to support her theory, but she
didn't stop there. Bruckner approached the captain in charge of the
clinic at Fort Benjamin Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You have to stop issuing shoes by the pair. Issue
shoes by the each. The soldiers in our clinic with problems have
one foot significantly different from the other.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady,'' she remembers his saying, ``this is the Army. We can't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner didn't give up on her dream of perfect shoes for the
masses. In 1996, she met Dimitris Metaxas, a computer scientist at
the University of Pennsylvania. He invited her to a look at a
trademarked program called Jack, a computer model of a person who
exists only on-screen and was designed to create better
workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner immediately saw the program's potential to help her
design shoes to fit every foot in the world perfectly. But while
Jack's upper body seemed to accurately replicate a human's, his
feet were another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack walked like a robot,'' she says. ``Jack had no subtalar
joints. His feet looked like slabs of meat.''
</P>
<P>
   Although jack is now owned by a private company that contracts
the program to corporations, his existence lured Bruckner to
Philadelphia: She needed virtual patients to model virtual shoes,
and the center's programmers could build them.
</P>
<P>
   Two computer models are under development. One is a gait model
that walks according to an individual's variations. Until now,
every gait model worked from an ideal algorithm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody walks like anybody else, much less with an ideal
gait,'' Bruckner says.
</P>
<P>
   The other model represents a person's foot, facilitating
shoe-design for individual needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to put these two programs together and run clinical
studies. I want to use these intelligent programs to fabricate
shoes and make orthotics.''
</P>
<P>
   From the feet of mankind comes a heartfelt thank-you.

 By STEWART MASSAD  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ``I've been dreaming about having a baby,'' Ashley said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a strange thing for a childless 36-year-old woman to
tell her gynecologist, but it surprised me because this patient is
HIV-infected. Having a baby implies having a future, something that
those of us who have watched women die of AIDS once never dared
hope for.
</P>
<P>
   But Ashley has always been tenacious. Six years ago, the
boyfriend who introduced her to heroin and HIV died of pneumonia,
leaving her resolved to convince others not to duplicate her
mistakes. She began speaking in schools, women's shelters and
halfway houses. Before long she met Ron, another former drug user
who is HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   Their collaboration in the fight against AIDS inspired a love
bold enough to include the prospect of having a child.
</P>
<P>
   When Ashley came under my care a few years ago, she told me she
had initially fought against AIDS with little hope of victory. But
in 1994, she participated in a landmark study. The results
demonstrated that a combination drug therapy including inhibitors
of the HIV protease enzyme, begun early in the course of infection,
could reduce the virus to undetectable levels in blood samples and
prolong life.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley began to dream of having a child. She read all she could
about her disease and the latest advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about this for a long time,'' she finally
said, as we sat together in a conference room, ``but it seemed so
unfair to bear a child I'd never be there for. Now, for the first
time s diagnosis, I feel like there might be a life for me.
I want your perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   I took a long breath. Until recently, children born with HIV
usually died as infants or toddlers, from diarrhea, pneumonia or
meningitis. Thanks to advances in antiviral therapy, those days are
largely past, and children born with HIV now live into their teens
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, results from the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group,
a national consortium of clinicians and patients involved in
experimental studies, showed that when mothers were treated with
the anti-HIV drug zidovudine during late pregnancy and labor, only
8 percent of the babies were born HIV-infected. Among women given
placebos, 26 percent of the babies were born HIV-infected.
</P>
<P>
   By lessening the amount of HIV in the mother's blood, zidovudine
reduced the exposure of the baby to blood-borne virus during
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   More recent studies have deepened our understanding of anti-HIV
drug therapy. When mothers take zidovudine along with protease
inhibitors and other drugs, the risk is much lower than when they
take zidovudine alone. In Ashley's case the infection was
relatively well controlled. At 397, her CD4 count, the number of
infection-fighting T cells, was OK, and the virus in her blood was
too low to show up in tests.
</P>
<P>
   Staying healthy required a complicated drug regimen: pills taken
up to five times each day, some with food, some on an empty
stomach. But Ashley was nothing if not dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't see her until she returned six months later for her
annual Pap smear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying,'' she told me. ``Some people tell me that it's
selfish, that any risk of handing on this disease is too great. But
to me, having a baby is standing up to the virus. We think it's
time to look ahead, to create life, not just avoid dying.''
</P>
<P>
   We talked about the ethical issues her pregnancy raised. We
talked about how HIV mutates rapidly, and the same viral strain can
evolve differently in different individuals with different immune
systems and genetic makeups.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley accepted that if Ron stopped using condoms it was
theoretically possible that she might get infected with a more
virulent strain of HIV. She understood that in the months or years
to come the virus she carried might become resistant to drugs,
killing her before her baby had a chance to know her. She had made
plans: Her sister had agreed to raise the child if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Within three months, Ashley was pregnant. She faced morning
sickness, which compounded the nausea caused by her anti-HIV drugs.
Twice she had to be admitted to the hospital because she could not
keep any liquids or anti-retroviral medications down.
</P>
<P>
   But with an antiemetic patch behind her ear, she managed to keep
taking her pills, even when she could swallow nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   By the 15th week of pregnancy, Ashley's appetite returned. The
next issue she faced was amniocentesis. For pregnant women of her
age, genetic testing is standard to identify babies with Down
syndrome and other defects. But the needle required to draw cells
from the amniotic fluid can introduce HIV into the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley decided to forgo the procedure, as HIV-infected mothers
are advised to do, and get a detailed ultrasound instead. Her
knuckles were white as she clutched Ron's hand during the
procedure, but the ultrasound was fine.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley's contractions started early during her third trimester.
Soon after, she quit work to rest in bed. Weekly ultrasound scans
showed the baby growing and kicking, stretching in anticipation of
birth.
</P>
<P>
   How to deliver the baby was the next critical issue. Cesarean
section reduces the risk of HIV transmission to the child because
the baby encounters the mother's virus-infected blood only briefly
during the procedure. Unfortunately, the risks to the mother _
infection, bleeding and anesthetic complications _ are higher for
cesareans than for vaginal deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that matters is protecting my child. I'll take the
knife,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months into the pregnancy, Ashley's contractions picked up
again. Her cervix softened and began to open. We had to perform the
cesarean before the bag of amniotic fluid broke, exposing the baby
to virus in the mother's body.
</P>
<P>
   Like any surgical procedure, cesarean section requires all the
usual precautions: gowns, masks, gloves. But in the age of AIDS, we
have added new barriers. The masks have shields to protect against
splashes of blood. The gowns are impermeable. Everyone on the
operating team wears two sets of gloves, and shoes are covered with
knee-high gaiters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, performing a cesarean section on a woman with HIV is
frightening because the initial focus is not to stop the bleeding
but to deliver the baby as quickly and safely as possible. Removing
the placenta is especially worrisome, because potentially lethal
blood mixes with amniotic fluid and spills over the operating
drapes.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley's surgery was uneventful, and her baby girl, although
small, seemed to thrive. She longed to nurse her daughter, but she
had to give her formula to avoid transmitting the virus through
breast milk.

<P>
   ``I've been dreaming about having a baby,'' Ashley said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a strange thing for a childless 36-year-old woman to
tell her gynecologist, but it surprised me because this patient is
HIV-infected. Having a baby implies having a future, something that
those of us who have watched women die of AIDS once never dared
hope for.
</P>
<P>
   But Ashley has always been tenacious. Six years ago, the
boyfriend who introduced her to heroin and HIV died of pneumonia,
leaving her resolved to convince others not to duplicate her
mistakes. She began speaking in schools, women's shelters and
halfway houses. Before long she met Ron, another former drug user
who is HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   Their collaboration in the fight against AIDS inspired a love
bold enough to include the prospect of having a child.
</P>
<P>
   When Ashley came under my care a few years ago, she told me she
had initially fought against AIDS with little hope of victory. But
in 1994, she participated in a landmark study. The results
demonstrated that a combination drug therapy including inhibitors
of the HIV protease enzyme, begun early in the course of infection,
could reduce the virus to undetectable levels in blood samples and
prolong life.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley began to dream of having a child. She read all she could
about her disease and the latest advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about this for a long time,'' she finally
said, as we sat together in a conference room, ``but it seemed so
unfair to bear a child I'd never be there for. Now, for the first
time since my diagnosis, I feel like there might be a life for me.
I want your perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   I took a long breath. Until recently, children born with HIV
usually died as infants or toddlers, from diarrhea, pneumonia or
meningitis. Thanks to advances in antiviral therapy, those days are
largely past, and children born with HIV now live into their teens
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, results from the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group,
a national consortium of clinicians and patients involved in
experimental studies, showed that when mothers were treated with
the anti-HIV drug zidovudine during late pregnancy and labor, only
8 percent of the babies were born HIV-infected. Among women given
placebos, 26 percent of the babies were born HIV-infected.
</P>
<P>
   By lessening the amount of HIV in the mother's blood, zidovudine
reduced the exposure of the baby to blood-borne virus during
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   More recent studies have deepened our understanding of anti-HIV
drug therapy. When mothers take zidovudine along with protease
inhibitors and other drugs, the risk is much lower than when they
take zidovudine alone. In Ashley's case the infection was
relatively well controlled. At 397, her CD4 count, the number of
infection-fighting T cells, was OK, and the virus in her blood was
too low to show up in tests.
</P>
<P>
   Staying healthy required a complicated drug regimen: pills taken
up to five times each day, some with food, some on an empty
stomach. But Ashley was nothing if not dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't see her until she returned six months later for her
annual Pap smear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying,'' she told me. ``Some people tell me that it's
selfish, that any risk ing on this disease is too great. But
to me, having a baby is standing up to the virus. We think it's
time to look ahead, to create life, not just avoid dying.''
</P>
<P>
   We talked about the ethical issues her pregnancy raised. We
talked about how HIV mutates rapidly, and the same viral strain can
evolve differently in different individuals with different immune
systems and genetic makeups.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley accepted that if Ron stopped using condoms it was
theoretically possible that she might get infected with a more
virulent strain of HIV. She understood that in the months or years
to come the virus she carried might become resistant to drugs,
killing her before her baby had a chance to know her. She had made
plans: Her sister had agreed to raise the child if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Within three months, Ashley was pregnant. She faced morning
sickness, which compounded the nausea caused by her anti-HIV drugs.
Twice she had to be admitted to the hospital because she could not
keep any liquids or anti-retroviral medications down.
</P>
<P>
   But with an antiemetic patch behind her ear, she managed to keep
taking her pills, even when she could swallow nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   By the 15th week of pregnancy, Ashley's appetite returned. The
next issue she faced was amniocentesis. For pregnant women of her
age, genetic testing is standard to identify babies with Down
syndrome and other defects. But the needle required to draw cells
from the amniotic fluid can introduce HIV into the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley decided to forgo the procedure, as HIV-infected mothers
are advised to do, and get a detailed ultrasound instead. Her
knuckles were white as she clutched Ron's hand during the
procedure, but the ultrasound was fine.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley's contractions started early during her third trimester.
Soon after, she quit work to rest in bed. Weekly ultrasound scans
showed the baby growing and kicking, stretching in anticipation of
birth.
</P>
<P>
   How to deliver the baby was the next critical issue. Cesarean
section reduces the risk of HIV transmission to the child because
the baby encounters the mother's virus-infected blood only briefly
during the procedure. Unfortunately, the risks to the mother _
infection, bleeding and anesthetic complications _ are higher for
cesareans than for vaginal deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that matters is protecting my child. I'll take the
knife,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months into the pregnancy, Ashley's contractions picked up
again. Her cervix softened and began to open. We had to perform the
cesarean before the bag of amniotic fluid broke, exposing the baby
to virus in the mother's body.
</P>
<P>
   Like any surgical procedure, cesarean section requires all the
usual precautions: gowns, masks, gloves. But in the age of AIDS, we
have added new barriers. The masks have shields to protect against
splashes of blood. The gowns are impermeable. Everyone on the
operating team wears two sets of gloves, and shoes are covered with
knee-high gaiters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, performing a cesarean section on a woman with HIV is
frightening because the initial focus is not to stop the bleeding
but to deliver the baby as quickly and safely as possible. Removing
the placenta is especially worrisome, because potentially lethal
blood mixes with amniotic fluid and spills over the operating
drapes.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley's surgery was uneventful, and her baby girl, although
small, seemed to thrive. She longed to nurse her daughter, but she
had to give her formula to avoid transmitting the virus through
breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came to test the baby for HIV, Ashley burst into
tears. When the test results came back, she cried again. The child
had escaped infection.
</P>
<P>
   The parents named her Hope.

<P>
   Jan Bruckner, a professor of physical therapy at Thomas
Jefferson University in Philadelphia, heads across campus for a 10
a.m. appointment at the Human Performance Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   There, Gary Sylvester, one of Bruckner's students, nervously
waits. He has responded to her standing offer to examine any pupil
who complains of foot pain.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner begins the evaluation by asking his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-three,'' he announces.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of 23?'' says an older woman being treated for a serious
foot problem in the same lab. She listens jealously as Sylvester
explains that he runs 15 miles a week. His feet rub inside his
shoes, get raw around the toes and develop blisters.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester is far from alone. After years of clinical practice,
anthropological research and pioneering studies, Bruckner has
concluded that, biomechanically speaking, there's no such thing as
a normal human foot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead there is a spectrum of variations. Biologically, the
foot remains a work in progress, and it needs a lot more help from
the shoe industry than it's getting.
</P>
<P>
   If Sylvester hadn't bothered to show up today, his blisters
could have easily led to heel spurs and then to instability in his
ankles and knees. Eventually his minor complaint would have turned
into chronic pain. But because he is still young, a simple,
custom-made shoe insert designed by Bruckner will save his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner is a quiet, polite revolutionary driven to save the
world's feet. She has worked in relative obscurity, refining her
theories of the lowest human appendage for 15 years without major
grants or corporate backing. Her work has become a crusade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, after eight years of practicing physical therapy,
Bruckner wanted more information about the foot's biomechanics. To
that end, she enrolled in the physical anthropology program at
Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   She began reading old anthropology studies about bones and
joints, work considered irrelevant in the medical community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered something that they'd never taught me when I
studied anatomy in physical therapy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A few anthropologists had written about a wide range of shapes
and configurations of the human foot, variations that modern
textbooks never mention. In particular, the shape of the talus bone
_ directly above the heel and below the lower leg bone _ differs
widely among humans.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, these anomalies don't amount to much. Mechanically,
however, Bruckner suspected they might mean a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   The variations that seemed most important to her occur in a
joint called the subtalar, where the rounded talus bone fits into
the knobby calcaneus, or heel bone.
</P>
<P>
   The bones' irregular forms usually touch each other at two or
three distinct points called facets. Bruckner realized that a joint
with three facets would be stable and rigid, like a stool with
three legs, and would restrict motion and allow more shock to shoot
through the foot into neighboring joints.
</P>
<P>
   Two-faceted joints, on the other hand, would allow greater
flexibility. Three facets looked like trouble, but Bruckner wasn't
sure how that variation affected modern humans. It turned out that
nobody else knew either.
</P>
<P>
   To find out, Bruckner needed lots of feet. She began with the
dead. Because she taught in the physical-therapy department at the
university's medical school, she had access to the cadavers used in
anatomy classes. She dissected the feet of more than 30 bodies and
tallied more three-faceted than two-faceted joints.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing, she found that one-third of the bodies had a
two-faceted joint in one foot but a three-faceted joint in the
other, or vice versa, violating left-right symmetry found elsewhere
in the body. In her small but random sample, Bruckner didn't find a
single normal pair of feet.
</P>
<P>
   She began to wonder what happens to the knees, hips and lower
backs in people who have mismatched shock absorbers in their feet.
</P>
<P>
   To continue her research on the living without using surgery,
she developed a technique for wiggling patients' heels to reveal
three-faceted joints. But she still needed a live group of research
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner found them by chance when she filled in as a temporary
physical therapist with the Tohono O'odham (pronounced like autumn)
tribe of southern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Bruckner struck a deal with the tribe: She agreed to
work at the reservation's clinic without pay if she could examine
the feet of any willing member of the tribe. Because the O'odham
are a relatively homogeneous population, Bruckner half expected to
find almost no variations in their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're about as close to genetically isolated as you're going
to find in North America,'' she says. Instead, she found wide
deviation in the subtalar joints.
</P>
<P>
   She still needed a research pool more diverse than the O'odham.
In the winter of 1989, the Persian Gulf War delivered them almost
to her front door.
</P>
<P>
   As troops were shipped to the gulf, Bruckner went to work for
the U.S. Army at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana. She worked for
free, under the proviso that she could examine the healthy feet of
anyone on the base who volunteered for her research.
</P>
<P>
   Again she found plenty of variation _ and something else. If a
soldier had a three-faceted joint in one foot and a two-faceted in
the other, the odds for injury were higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was even more devastating than facet configuration,'' she
says, ``was asymmetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner finally had enough data to support her theory, but she
didn't stop there. Bruckner approached the captain in charge of the
clinic at Fort Benjamin Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You have to stop issuing shoes by the pair. Issue
shoes by the each. The soldiers in our clinic with problems have
one foot significantly different from the other.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady,'' she remembers his saying, ``this is the Army. We can't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner didn't give up on her dream of perfect shoes for the
masses. In 1996, she met Dimitris Metaxas, a computer scientist at
the University of Pennsylvania. He invited her to a look at a
trademarked program called Jack, a computer model of a person who
exists only on-screen and was designed to create better
workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckner immediately saw the program's potential to help her
design shoes to fit every foot in the world perfectly. But while
Jack's upper body seemed to accurately replicate a human's, his
feet were another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack walked like a robot,'' she says. ``Jack had no subtalar
joints. His feet looked like slabs of meat.''
</P>
<P>
   Although jack is now owned by a private company that contracts
the program to corporations, his existence lured Bruckner to
Philadelphia: She needed virtual patients to model virtual shoes,
and the center's programmers could build them.
</P>
<P>
   Two computer models are under development. One is a gait model
that walks according to an individual's variations. Until now,
every gait model worked from an ideal algorithm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody walks like anybody else, much less with an ideal
gait,'' Bruckner says.
</P>
<P>
   The other model represents a person's foot, facilitating
shoe-design for individual needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to put these two programs together and run clinical
studies. I want to use these intelligent programs to fabricate
shoes and make orthotics.''
</P>
<P>
   From the feet of mankind comes a heartfelt thank-you.

   ``I've been dreaming about having a baby,'' Ashley said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a strange thing for a childless 36-year-old woman to
tell her gynecologist, but it surprised me because this patient is
HIV-infected. Having a baby implies having a future, something that
those of us who have watched women die of AIDS once never dared
hope for.
</P>
<P>
   But Ashley has always been tenacious. Six years ago, the
boyfriend who introduced her to heroin and HIV died of pneumonia,
leaving her resolved to convince others not to duplicate her
mistakes. She began speaking in schools, women's shelters and
halfway houses. Before long she met Ron, another former drug user
who is HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   Their collaboration in the fight against AIDS inspired a love
bold enough to include the prospect of having a child.
</P>
<P>
   When Ashley came under my care a few years ago, she told me she
had initially fought against AIDS with little hope of victory. But
in 1994, she participated in a landmark study. The results
demonstrated that a combination drug therapy including inhibitors
of the HIV protease enzyme, begun early in the course of infection,
could reduce the virus to undetectable levels in blood samples and
prolong life.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley began to dream of having a child. She read all she could
about her disease and the latest advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about this for a long time,'' she finally
said, as we sat together in a conference room, ``but it seemed so
unfair to bear a child I'd never be there for. Now, for the first
time since my diagnosis, I feel like there might be a life for me.
I want your perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   I took a long breath. Until recently, children born with HIV
usually died as infants or toddlers, from diarrhea, pneumonia or
meningitis. Thanks to advances in antiviral therapy, those days are
largely past, and children born with HIV now live into their teens
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, results from the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group,
a national consortium of clinicians and patients involved in
experimental studies, showed that when mothers were treated with
the anti-HIV drug zidovudine during late pregnancy and labor, only
8 percent of the babies were born HIV-infected. Among women given
placebos, 26 percent of the babies were born HIV-infected.
</P>
<P>
   By lessening the amount of HIV in the mother's blood, zidovudine
reduced the exposure of the baby to blood-borne virus during
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   More recent studies have deepened our understanding of anti-HIV
drug therapy. When mothers take zidovudine along with protease
inhibitors and other drugs, the risk is much lower than when they
take zidovudine alone. In Ashley's case the infection was
relatively well controlled. At 397, her CD4 count, the number of
infection-fighting T cells, was OK, and the virus in her blood was
too low to show up in tests.
</P>
<P>
   Staying healthy required a complicated drug regimen: pills taken
up to five times each day, some with food, some on an empty
stomach. But Ashley was nothing if not dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't see her until she returned six months later for her
annual Pap smear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying,'' she told me. ``Some people tell me that it's
selfish, that any risk of handing on this disease is too great. But
to me, having a baby is standing up to the virus. We think it's
time to look ahead, to create life, not just avoid dying.''
</P>
<P>
   We talked about the ethical issues her pregnancy raised. We
talked about how HIV mutates rapidly, and the same viral strain can
evolve differently in different individuals with different immune
systems and genetic makeups.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley accepted that if Ron stopped using condoms it was
theoretically possible that she might get infected with a more
virulent strain of HIV. She understood that in the months or years
to come the virus she carried might become resistant to drugs,
killing her before her baby had a chance to know her. She had made
plans: Her sister had agreed to raise the child if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Within three months, Ashley was pregnant. She faced morning
sickness, which compounded the nausea caused by her anti-HIV drugs.
Twice she had to be admitted to the hospital because she could not
keep any liquids or anti-retroviral medications down.
</P>
<P>
   But with an antiemetic patch behind her ear, she managed to keep
taking her pills, even when she could swallow nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   By the 15th week of pregnancy, Ashley's appetite returned. The
next issue she faced was amniocentesis. For pregnant women of her
age, genetic testing is standard to identify babies with Down
syndrome and other defects. But the needle required to draw cells
from the amniotic fluid can introduce HIV into the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley decided to forgo the procedure, as HIV-infected mothers
are advised to do, and get a detailed ultrasound instead. Her
knuckles were white as she clutched Ron's hand during the
procedure, but the ultrasound was fine.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley's contractions started early during her third trimester.
Soon after, she quit work to rest in bed. Weekly ultrasound scans
showed the baby growing and kicking, stretching in anticipation of
birth.
</P>
<P>
   How to deliver the baby was the next critical issue. Cesarean
section reduces the risk of HIV transmission to the child because
the baby encounters the mother's virus-infected blood only briefly
during the procedure. Unfortunately, the risks to the mother _
infection, bleeding and anesthetic complications _ are higher for
cesareans than for vaginal deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that matters is protecting my child. I'll take the
knife,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months into the pregnancy, Ashley's contractions picked up
again. Her cervix softened and began to open. We had to perform the
cesarean before the bag of amniotic fluid broke, exposing the baby
to virus in the mother's body.
</P>
<P>
   Like any surgical procedure, cesarean section requires all the
usual precautions: gowns, masks, gloves. But in the age of AIDS, we
have added new barriers. The masks have shields to protect against
splashes of blood. The gowns are impermeable. Everyone on the
operating team wears two sets of gloves, and shoes are covered with
knee-high gaiters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, performing a cesarean section on a woman with HIV is
frightening because the initial focus is not to stop the bleeding
but to deliver the baby as quickly and safely as possible. Removing
the placenta is especially worrisome, because potentially lethal
blood mixes with amniotic fluid and spills over the operating
drapes.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley's surgery was uneventful, and her baby girl, although
small, seemed to thrive. She longed to nurse her daughter, but she
had to give her formula to avoid transmitting the virus through
breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came to test the baby for HIV, Ashley burst into
tears. When the test results came back, she cried again. The child
had escaped infection.
</P>
<P>
   The parents named her Hope.

THE MARK OF MCCAIN: DEBATING PRESIDENTIAL CHARACTER AND SANITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (David Greenberg writes Slate's ``History Lesson'' column)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GREENBERG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's five years as a prisoner of war positioned him to
run for president as the candidate of ``character.'' His Vietnam
ordeal, it was said, made him candid, brave, inner-directed.
</P>
<P>
   Now McCain is running from the character issue: His Vietnam
ordeal, detractors allege, left him irascible, unstable, unfit for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   McCain recently released 1,500 pages of medical records to
provide what The New York Times has called ``the broadest look ever
given the public at the psychological profile of a presidential
candidate.'' Presidential ``character'' has returned as a public
and media obsession.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the character of presidents has always mattered.
Whether charging that Thomas Jefferson took a slave as his mistress
or that Grover Cleveland fathered an illegitimate child, opponents
have long assailed the morals of presidential aspirants. But in the
19th century such mudslinging never amounted to a full-scale
attempt to assess a candidate's psychological profile.
</P>
<P>
   John Adams, John Quincy Adams and Abraham Lincoln all probably
suffered from ``melancholy''--or depression--but their mental
health didn't enter the public debate. Most people didn't even know
about their conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Only with the rise of Freudian theory--specifically, the idea
that not only the ``ill'' but also well-functioning people are
captive to unconscious motives--did anyone think to psychoanalyze a
president.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stanley Allen Renshon (author of the invaluable
book ``The Psychological Assessment of Presidential Candidates''),
the first such effort appeared in a 1912 New York Times Magazine
article titled ``Roosevelt as Analyzed by the New Psychology.'' The
article tried to explain inconsistent comments that former
president Theodore Roosevelt had made about supporting his
successor, William Taft, by postulating that TR harbored an
unresolved, repressed wish to run for president again himself.
Though hardly controversial by today's standards (not least because
we know that TR did choose to run in 1912), the story provoked an
outcry, including a denunciation from Freud himself.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the spread of psychoanalysis made putting candidates on
the couch acceptable, the advent of nuclear weapons made
``stability'' the watchword not only in geopolitics but also in
psychopolitics. In the 1956 presidential race, Democrats seized on
what columnist Max Lerner called ``The Triple Issue'': President
Eisenhower's frail physical health (he'd had a heart attack in
September 1955), nukes (the Soviet Union built a hydrogen bomb in
November 1955), and, in Lerner's phrase, ``the character of Richard
Nixon'' (liberals viewed Nixon, then vice president, as bellicose
and ruthless).
</P>
<P>
   In an election-eve speech, Adlai Stevenson, the Democrats'
standard-bearer, said that ``As a citizen more than a candidate ...
I recoil at the prospect of Mr. Nixon as custodian of this nation's
future, as guardian of the hydrogen bomb ... as Commander-in-Chief
of the United States armed forces.'' Close aides disapproved,
feeling Stevenson had gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Democrats reprised the issue in 1964. To Barry Goldwater's
slogan ``In your heart you know he's right,'' Democrats countered:
``In your guts you know he's nuts.'' Lyndon Johnson's camp
portrayed the Republican senator as a trigger-happy Strangelove
likely to blow up the world.
</P>
<P>
   The now-defunct magazine FACT, published by the eccentric Ralph
Ginzburg, polled 12,356 members of the American Psychiatric
Association and used the 2,419 responses to conclude that the
psychiatrists considered Goldwater paranoid. While plenty of
psychiatrists did question Goldwater's temperament and judgment,
the study's methodology was so egregiously flawed that Goldwater
won a libel suit against the magazine. The APA itself denounced the
article--though, significantly, it also allowed that more
``reliable'' psychological assessments of a candidate might
reasonably inform voters' decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was the victors of those races, Johnson and
Nixon, who would further elevate the question of psychological
fitness for the presidency. With Nixon, the issue surfaced when
muckraker Drew Pearson told a National Press Club audience, just
after the 1968 election, that as vice president, Nixon had
consulted Arnold Hutschnecker, a New York physician specializing in
psychosomatic illnesses. To his death, Nixon maintained he had
consulted Hutschnecker only as a physician and not for
psychotherapy, though skeptics wondered why he would travel to New
York for a checkup. One unproven claim was impotence.
</P>
<P>
   When in 1973 Gerald Ford appeared before a Senate panel to be
confirmed as vice president, he had to explain his own visits to
Hutschnecker. ``One Question Marks Ford Hearing,'' read the New
York Times headline over the story about Ford's testimony. Ford's
explanation: He had visited the doctor on Nixon's urging, but only
socially.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutschnecker episode introduced a new aspect of the
character issue: the stigma of seeing a shrink. In the New York
Times, Hutschnecker argued that seeking help to secure one's
``emotional stability'' denoted ``not weakness but courage'' and
should not be stigmatized. Most commentators agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Hovering behind this debate, of course, was the lingering memory
of the 1972 campaign, when Missouri Sen. Thomas Eagleton, days
after being chosen as George McGovern's running mate, resigned from
the Democratic ticket after revealing that he had undergone
hospitalization and electroshock therapy for depression. That story
quickly (and somewhat inaccurately) came to be portrayed as an
illustration of the public's ignorance of mental health issues.
</P>
<P>
   By 1976, the character question was morphing from the matter of
mental stability into the larger issue of what kind of a president
a candidate would make. Watching Johnson and Nixon visit their
private demons on the nation made the public correctly curious
about candidates' hidden selves. Academicians, most notably
political scientist James David Barber in his influential
``Presidential Character,'' explored how to predict a president's
performance based on a systematic study of his character.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the decline of the major political parties was
creating a new ``candidate-centered'' politics, which emphasized
the individual and further spotlighted his psychic makeup.
</P>
<P>
   In these years, however, what people meant by ``character''
became increasingly confused. In 1976, Jimmy Carter stressed his
character, by which he meant his (alleged) honesty. In 1988, the
press expanded the issue to include questions of marital
infidelity, judgment, and narcissism, as Gary Hart learned the hard
way. By the Clinton years, the character question was reduced to a
checklist of intrusive inquiries about past infidelity, military
service and drug use--and, if evasive or dishonest answers were
given, also about honesty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   What we mean--and should mean--by ``character'' needs to be
disentangled. First, there's no question that seeking psychological
help needs to be destigmatized. Al and Tipper Gore have helped by
saying they've each had ``counseling'' but, as Frank Rich has
noted, Tipper's use of such euphemisms and the avoidance a
``professional title (that might include the prefix 'psych-') ...
sent the signal, consciously or not, that she wasn't entirely free
of shame herself.''
</P>
<P>
   When, after the Lewinsky affair, President Clinton chose not to
see a real clinician but a bunch of ministers, he sent the same
message.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, removing the stigma of therapy doesn't mean rejecting
consideration of character. Obviously, a president's ambition,
judgment, temperament, integrity, and ways of relating with other
people (among other psychological qualities) bear greatly on how he
will govern--at least as greatly as whatever election-year stands
he stakes out on ``the issues'' of policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson and Nixon presidencies are only the most salient
examples of this truth. Many others exist, too. One historian has
argued cogently that Calvin Coolidge's psychological problems
helped derail his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The real question, then, is how to assess character. Clearly,
the press has done a lousy job with its focus on behavior such as
infidelity or drug use that most people don't care about.
Alternatively, some psychotherapists have argued that professionals
alone should do the evaluating.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, Arnold Hutschnecker, reveling in his 15 minutes of
fame, proposed establishing an official board of psychiatrists to
screen all presidential candidates. Not surprisingly, the push for
a shrinkocracy has gained little support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just because we've failed to think clearly about what
character involves doesn't mean we should cease to think about it.
The press can also do a poor job analyzing policy issues--what was
the last really illuminating story you read about the Social
Security trust fund?--but no one argues it should abandon the
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The press is right to focus on character. Now it needs to think
more rigorously about how to do so.

 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Every year it was the same: the congregation sang ``Silent
Night, Holy Night'' as candlelight filled the darkened sanctuary.
Church bells sounded midnight. It was Christmas.
 &HT;    Even when my parents did not attend services regularly, my
family celebrated Christmas by going to church. On Christmas Eve,
we'd have guests, serve a late supper and attend the midnight
service at the local Methodist church.
 &HT;    Guilt, sentimentality, tradition? I never knew why mother and
dad wanted to go. They just did.
 &HT;    I looked to the family Christmas Eve with great anticipation. I
love Christmas carols and hymns. Singing them in an
evergreen-draped church set the mood for the busy days to follow.
Many of my favorite family memories are of that holiday service.
 &HT;    This year, however, I considerd not attending the midnight
service on Christmas Eve. Despite its nostalgic beauty, Christmas
Eve church troubles me.
 &HT;    Finding a seat at a midnight service is like finding a parking
place at the local mall. The church is full of people you've never
seen. Inevitably, someone is sitting in your favorite pew. Folks
know the traditional carols but the liturgy and regular music
confuses them. They don't know how to take communion.
 &HT;    And the minister preaches some predictable sermon about peace
and goodwill, not wanting to offend the ``Christmas and Easter''
crowd. As a regular churchgoer myself, I find the ``big'' Christian
holidays spiritually tedious.
 &HT;    But it's really not even this Christmas religious rush that
troubles me. Rather, Christmas Eve itself troubles me -- it reminds
me of how hard it is to live as a Christmas person all year.
 &HT;    In a way, I envy my ``Christmas and Easter'' brothers and
sisters. Perhaps they can hear about ``peace and goodwill'' on
December 24 and count it only a charming story, a utopian pipe
dream.
 &HT;    Christmas Eve is not a once-a-year proposition. Like marriage,
like churchgoing, it is a tough-minded commitment to bring forth
God's love in the world.
 &HT;    In the Gospel of Luke, Mary announces the coming of God's
kingdom through her child: ``He has shown strength with his arm; he
has scattered the proud. He has brought down the powerful from
their thrones, and lifted up the lowly; he has filled the hungry
with good things, and sent the rich away empty.''
 &HT;    She's not ``Mother Mary, meek and mild.'' She's a biblical
prophet thundering away at the wealthy and indifferent.
 &HT;    Jesus is not just her sweet baby. For Christians, Jesus is the
embodiment of God's vision for humanity -- perfect justice and joy
forever. The prophet Isaiah describes this vision as a New
Jerusalem in which God's people find dignity, prosperity and peace.
There, ``the wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall
eat straw like an ox.''
 &HT;    When the angels announced Jesus' birth, they proclaimed that
God's New Jerusalem had come. The long-expected Kingdom could now
be found among humankind. This child was its prophet, priest and
king.
 &HT;    Every Christmas Eve, we sing that proclamation: ``Hark, the
herald angels sing! Glory to the newborn King! Peace on earth and
mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled.'' It is here! It is here!
The Kingdom of God has come!
 &HT;    But where?
 &HT;    As we step over the homeless on the way to the parking lot? As
we lament wars and rumors of wars? As children starve on this
Christmas Eve? As people die? The divorced and widowed cry at home
alone? Just where is the Kingdom of God?
 &HT;    It is, of course, a mystery how that Kingdom could be here and
not be here at the same time. Some people say, rather
disingenuously, that God's' kingdom is in our hearts. But the
Hebrew and Christian prophets proclaim a real kingdom, a physical
place of union and harmony with God, one another, and all creation.
 &HT;    Living into that reality is the stuff of church (and synagogue,
temple and mosque as well). God's reign is being brought forth and
worked out by God's people. It is commitment to make a more just
world in Gods image, to serve others, to love our neighbors as
ourselves.
 &HT;    We cry, yes. But not out of nostalgia. We cry because it is hard
to live as Christmas Eve people -- believing the truth of the
angelic proclamation and acting on it every single day.
 &HT;    And I will be there on Christmas Eve just as I have always been.
Singing my heart out, teary-eyed, and praying for the grace to do
it better this coming year.

CHRISTMAS: WHAT IF MARY HAD SAID NO TO THE ANGEL?

   (Commentary)

 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``Hail Mary, full of grace: The Lord is with thee. Blessed art
thou among women.''
 &HT;    These words, second nature to Catholics, always seem foreign to
me. Growing up Methodist, I rarely heard anything of the Virgin
Mary.
 &HT;    Except, of course, at Christmas.
 &HT;    As a child, I eagerly awaited unpacking the creche. Year after
year, I reverently woke Mary from her attic slumber, unwrapping her
from yellowed newspaper. Oddly comforting, she never changed. Her
blue robes flowed around her, arms crossed gently on her breast,
and eyes cast downward watching her baby son in wonder. She
embodied motherly love.
 &HT;    However, as I grew up, my childhood affection for Mary waned.
Her example of submissive motherhood offered little inspiration to
a baby boomer career woman. As feminist theologian Mary Daly put
it, ``The myth of the Incarnation logically implied the usurpation
of female power.''
 &HT;    In recent years, however, Mary's story has impressed me anew.
 &HT;    Two thousand years ago, an angel visited a young girl anxiously
awaiting her own marriage. ``Fear not, Mary,'' the angel said,
``for you have found favor with God. You will conceive in your womb
and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus.''
 &HT;    Astounded, Mary asked, ``How can this be, since I am a virgin?''
 &HT;    The angel replied, ``God's spirit will come upon you and the
power of the Most High will overshadow you.''
 &HT;    Then the heavens waited.
 &HT;    Would she agree?
 &HT;    Although we don't often consider the possibility, Mary could
have said no. If I had been her, I would have. God's favor?
Pregnant out of wedlock? What of Joseph? What about the wedding?
What would my parents say? No, thank you.
 &HT;    God asked her to give up love, honor, happiness and reputation.
To accomplish God's will, she would become a social outcast.
 &HT;    The heavens waited. History hung on the word of a teenage girl.
 &HT;    ``Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me
according to your word.''
 &HT;    Yes! Yes! Yes! The word reverberated throughout the universe.
Angels rejoiced. Because of one girl's yes, God's son would be
born.
 &HT;    Mary responded not in fear, but in love. ``My soul magnifies the
Lord, my spirit rejoices in God my Savior!'' Not a submissive
woman, she risked everything with an extraordinary yes.
 &HT;    Mary's yes _ giving birth to Jesus _ transformed the world. What
if she had said no?
 &HT;    No is a powerful word. Filled with deadening power, no kills
love, creativity, and possibilities. Mary's no would have denied
the world Jesus.
 &HT;    Yes opens doors. Yes breathes life into impossible dreams. Yes
hopes when hope is not seen. Yes embodies courage.
 &HT;    Visionaries hear and speak yes when common sense says no. Martin
Luther King's yes to racial equality. Desmond Tutu's yes to a
democratic South Africa. Yitzhak Rabin's yes to Mideast peace.
 &HT;    The great theologian Karl Barth believed that ``no'' is sin.
Human beings say no to God and no to one another. In spite of our
no, Barth insisted that God said yes to us. Entering into human
history, God overcame every no with the resounding yes of a baby
born into the world.
 &HT;    When the baby grew to a man, he said yes, too. Saying yes to
God, Jesus submitted to humiliation, pain and death _ all for the
love of his brothers and sisters.
 &HT;    If not for Mary's yes, God's yes would have been silenced. No
wonder generations have blessed her.
 &HT;    This holiday season, I suggest we change ``just say no'' to
``just say yes.'' When we say yes to God, yes to love, and yes to
each other, healing and reconciliation come.
 &HT;    The Christmas story proclaims God's yes: Love and peace are born
into the world. Truly, good news of great joy for all people!

HIGHER RETURN REQUIRES ASUMING MORE RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 62 and retired. My combined pension and Social Security
give me $21,000 a year. My wife, who doesn't plan to retire, has a
part-time job earning $12,000 a year. Combined, this is enough to
live on, since we own our home and take only one mini-vacation a
year. I currently have an IRA CD at 5.5 percent worth $90,000 that
will mature in two months. I would like to transfer this to my IRA
account at Schwab, which now consists of $5,000 in Janus Balanced
and $5,000 in American Century Growth. My plan is to divide the
money evenly among Janus Balanced, American Century Growth, and a
GNMA fund. I will not need any of this money for at least five
years, since I have $55,000 in savings bonds for any emergency. I
am a cautious investor, but can I realize a safe return of 7
percent to 9 percent with little risk, or should I put the entire
$90,000 in a GNMA fund and take the safer yield?
</P>
<P>
   J.C., East Boston, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's hard to give you an answer without coming to an
understanding of risk. What you're proposing is dividing that
$90,000 just about evenly between stock market and fixed-income
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever you are dealing with the stock market, you can't make a
projection of growth and categorize it as safe or having little
risk. This is particularly true now, when the stock market has been
spurting ahead at nearly unprecedented levels for half a decade;
the prospect for a cooling off seems almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   So if the operative words in your letter are conservative, safe,
and little risk, then your plan is probably too aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Why not consider as an alternative putting half of the money
into the GNMA fund (and I would counsel the Vanguard GNMA as the
fund of choice in this category) and then divide the rest of the
money between American Century Growth and Janus Balanced or another
balanced fund.
</P>
<P>
   I say another balanced fund because Janus Balanced isn't your
run-of-the-mill balanced fund. Although Morningstar rates it
average for risk, it also terms its portfolio quirky and notes a
dominance of expensive growth stocks and high-yield (or junk)
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   It wins four stars, for an above-average overall rating from
Morningstar, as can be attested to by its 19.44 percent
year-to-date return as this is written.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a more conservative balanced fund, you might
consider Vanguard Balanced Index, which also wins an above-average
overall grade from Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   But the fund analysis company says the fund doesn't take a lot
of chances. It's year-to-date return stands at 11.23 percent, but I
suspect the situations would be reversed in a sour market.
</P>
<P>
   With the toned-down portfolio, I think the prospect for average
annual returns in the 7 percent to 9 percent range are quite good _
but again, since you would have 37.5 percent to 40 percent stocks,
it wouldn't be reasonable to use either the words safe or little
risk in connection with it.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce risk still further, you might cut the position in the
growth fund to 15 to 20 percent, increasing either the GNMA or
balanced fund position. But of course as you reduce the level of
risk, the prospects of getting closer to the 9 percent range of
your projected returns decreases.
</P>
<P>
   One final thought. If you could arrange your affairs so that you
wouldn't need to draw upon the IRA account for a longer period of
time _ say until you reach the age of mandatory withdrawals after
70 1/2 _ your original proposal looks a good deal safer. The longer
your investment time frame, the higher level of risk you can
prudently take.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 50-year-old recent widow and I make $40,000 a year and
rent a modestly priced but nice apartment. Beginning in January, I
will fund my 401(k) account with 15 percent of my earnings, and my
employer will match 4 percent. I will continue at the same levels
until I am 60, during which time I anticipate my salary will
increase at a rate of 3 percent a year. I am in the process of
selling my home in Maryland, from which I will net $150,000. I also
have $30,000 that I inherited from my late husband's IRA. As a
widow, at age 60 I will be able to draw Social Security against my
husband's earning record, and at 62 or 66 I can switch to drawing
against my own record. I enjoy the relatively high wages of
Southern California, but since real estate here is so expensive,
when I retire I plan to move to Albuquerque, where the cost of
living is much lower _ I could buy a very nice house there for
$100,000 in today's dollars. My goal at age 60 is to buy two
mortgage-free houses in Albuquerque: one to live in and one to
rent. I have a fairly simple standard of living and believe I will
be able to live quite contentedly on my Social Security plus rental
income. Does this sound realistic? Where should I invest my 401(k)
funds? What should I do with the $180,000?
</P>
<P>
   J.J., Orange, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's start with the 401(k). If you invest the money in a
balance of conservative growth and balanced funds, you might expect
average annual returns of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With total contributions between yourself and your employer of
14 percent of your earnings (which would increase from $40,000 to
$52,188 based on your projection) you would accumulate a total of
$128,419 after 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, the monthly contributions from yourself and
your employer would slowly grow from $633.33 in the first year to
$826.31 in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   If your $30,000 in the IRA account were similarly invested, you
could expect an accumulation of $64,767.
</P>
<P>
   And if the $150,000 were similarly invested, this time in index
funds _ which tend to be fairly tax-efficient _ you might attain
after-tax returns of about 6 percent and therefore amass $268,627
in that account.
</P>
<P>
   (One way to improve the overall tax situation would be to put
$2,000 of your taxable money _ that $150,000 pool _ into a Roth IRA
each year, thus entirely sheltering that money from future
taxation.)
</P>
<P>
   The upshot would be that you would have plenty of money
available to buy real estate in Albuquerque. If the price of
Albuquerque real estate advances at a 3.5 percent rate for the next
10 years, a house that costs $100,000 now would cost $141,059 then.
</P>
<P>
   I don't question that it would be a nice thing to buy yourself a
house at that point, but I suggest you think carefully about the
idea of a rental property.
</P>
<P>
   If you put the $141,059 that a rental house would cost into a
fixed-income mutual fund yielding 6.5 percent, it would bring you
an income stream of $9,168 a year, or $764 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The question I would then ask is this: Are you sure that after
paying for insurance, taxes, maintenance, repairs, and facing the
countless unforeseeable headaches that can go with being a
landlord, do you think you could net as much as $764 a month
through renting the property?
</P>
<P>
   True, one advantage of a rental property is that you can
increase the rental level to offset the effects of inflation;
equally true, there's a reasonable chance that the property will
gain in value, provided you carefully maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   But one advantage of a position in a GNMA fund is that you
wouldn't have to worry about sloppy tenants, deadbeat tenants, new
furnaces, property tax increases, and so forth, on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, unless you have a lot of experience in real estate
and know all of the ins and outs of that business, I would think
that investing the money would yield you a more certain, and
perhaps higher, income stream.
</P>
<P>
   As for target investments, I would put all of the money in
conservative but growth-oriented stock and balanced funds. With
your 401(k) you will be limited by the options presented in the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   For your own investments, I'd suggest a mixture of
value-oriented large-cap stock funds such as Vanguard Windsor II or
Vanguard Index Value, and balanced funds, which divide their assets
among stocks and bonds. Good examples in the same family are
Vanguard Balanced Index and Vanguard Star.
</P>
<P>

----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Correction: There have been an enormous number of mergers in the
mutual fund industry, but in last Monday's column I inadvertently
included one that hasn't happened. The American Fund family and the
American Century group are entirely different mutual fund
companies.

   SOFIA, Bulgaria _ A few months before Bill Clinton became the
first US president to visit this former communist country,
Western-leaning reformers set out to demolish what they considered
an embarrassing reminder of their past: Georgy Dimitrov's tomb.
</P>
<P>
   The mausoleum built in 1949 to hold the body of Dimitrov, the
Bulgarian communist leader, was modeled after Lenin's tomb and was
used as a stage from which stern commissars presided over glum May
Day parades in which workers were obliged to march.
</P>
<P>
   The first dynamite charge rocked the center of town in August,
but the mausoleum didn't budge. For seven days, demolition crews
used more and more explosives until they were able to destroy an
edifice that, it turns out, was built to withstand a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the fiasco, Galena Haritonova, a 30-year-old
Sofia resident, recalled that it took only six days to build the
mausoleum, one day less than it took to destroy it. There was a
lesson there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just blow up communism,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the fall of communism throughout a dozen Central
and Eastern European countries, more people are coming to that
conclusion. Even some economists who argued for the ``big bang,''
an immediate replacement of state ownership by privatization, are
beginning to accept that, like Georgy Dimitrov's tomb, it is
impossible to obliterate overnight a way of thinking and a way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   As Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has acknowledged,
communism was as much a cultural phenomenon as an economic system.
And if economies can in theory change overnight, cultures do not.

former Yugoslavia suggest that the countries of Central and Eastern
Europe are having varying degrees of success in their transition to
free-market democracies.
</P>
<P>
   There are some trends. Those countries physically closer to
Western Europe, such as Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic,
are doing better than others. No surprise they were the first
ex-communist countries to join NATO. The lure of joining the
European Union is also providing an incentive for former communist
countries to open up their markets and change their laws and
institutions, even in Romania and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme nationalism, which Marx considered as insidious as
capitalism, has destroyed Yugoslavia and is spreading. Women, who
were by ideology the equals of men under communism, are worse off.
Gangsters have adapted to the free market better than most,
assisted by police forces that are inexperienced at fighting, or
corrupted by, organized crime. Educational achievement has dropped
in most countries.
</P>
<P>
   And while the air is much cleaner, due as much to closed
factories as improved environmental measures, more than two dozen
of the world's most accident-prone nuclear reactors are spread
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   If Eastern Europe is not as gray as it used to be, people joke
that this part of the world is redder than ever. The disappearance
of the ubiquitous red communist flag has been more than made up for
by the red signs of Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and Pizza Hut.
</P>
<P>
   People here and in other former communist countries enjoy the
freedom to travel and to buy what to them is a dizzying array of
goods. Personal freedom means that in Vratza, a small town in
northern Bulgaria, there is a Playboy Club boasting of ``go-go
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   But while many people find it difficult to calculate the gains
they have made in personal freedom, many have calculated the rise
in prices and drop in buying power. While everyone had a job under
communism, even meaningless ones, some 25 million people in the
former Soviet bloc have lost their jobs under the free market,
creating a regional jobless average of 10 percent. The
cradle-to-grave social net has collapsed in many places.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development found that the percentage of people living in poverty
in Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic rose from 1
percent in 1988 to 12 percent by 1995. In that same period, it went
from 2 percent to 15 percent in Bulgaria and 6 percent to 59
percent in Romania. That same report found that life expectancy had
increased in that first group of countries, but had remained mostly
constant or dropped in the other parts of Central and Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A decade on, there is a growing nostalgia for the certainties of
life under communism. Speaking in Prague at a conference, Polish
newspaper editor and former dissident Adam Michnik described that
contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to live like the upper middle class in Manhattan,
have the social security guarantees of the communist system, and
work as they used to, which is not at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a beaten stool outside her farmhouse in the northern
Bulgarian village of Hurletz, Nikolina Varbanova, 79, stroked a
kitten in her lap and offered a common assessment, especially among
anyone over 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was better before,'' she said as a few of her goats grazed
nearby. ``Pensions are low. Prices are higher.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her 82-year-old husband survive on about $35 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Younger people have taken to the changes more easily. At New
York Radio City, a private club in Sofia that provides members with
a distinctly American bar and restaurant, they're expanding to
accommodate a growing membership that includes people from 27
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Tyron Lowry, the American general manager, came back to Sofia
this year after being here in the mid-1990s and noticed the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``More smiles, more confidence,'' he said. ``People used to walk
arm in arm, down the street, holding onto each other. Now they're
spreading out, stretching out.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   A tale of two Miroslavs
</P>
<P>
   KLADNO, Czech Republic _ This is a story about two men named
Miroslav. They grew up only 15 miles apart. But their lives have
been dramatically changed by the fall of communism, one for the
better, the other for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Miroslav Vrtic, 44, will always equate the collapse of communism
with the collapse of his mother. When he told her he had lost his
job at the newly privatized steel mill, she fell to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She died three days later,'' he recalled, stamping out one of
the cigarettes he chain-smokes. ``There are some things that will
literally break your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a half-hour's drive from the ghost town that is the Poldi
steel mill, Miroslav Singer sits in his office in Prague. Singer
was born in 1968, the year of the student uprising that was crushed
by the Red Army. While not dissidents, his family was regarded
suspiciously by the authorities. His father, an engineer, refused
repeated entreaties to join the Communist Party, which controlled
access to education and jobs. Singer's future was bleak.
</P>
<P>
   But the Velvet Revolution 10 years ago changed all that. The
doors to the good schools that had been blocked to those like
Singer were opened. Singer got a scholarship to the best high
school in Prague, then studied at the Prague School of Economics.
With the Iron Curtain down, he took advantage of the ability to
travel, gaining a doctorate in economics at the University of
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Today, sitting on the fourth floor of a building that houses the
corporate offices of Gillette, Lucent Technologies, Duracell,
Braun, and Barclays Bank, Singer heads the investment branch of
Expandia Bank. He is a post-communist yuppie, evidence of what can
happen when the marketplace, both in goods and ideas, is open.
</P>
<P>
   But, voicing a concern heard throughout the region, Singer
worries that too many former apparatchiks, or officials in former
Communist regimes, have moved into positions of authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not their ideology. The problem is they are
stupid,'' he said. ``They form networks that are ignorant at best,
and corrupt at worst. Bureaucrats and politicians can be
incompetent. But those who run corporations cannot be.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an incentive under the communist system to marry young
and have children because it guaranteed getting an apartment.
Singer and his wife, Jana, a financial manager for Philip Morris,
have delayed having children until they feel financially able to
provide for them.

THE BEASTLY BIAS OF BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a structured discussion about banks last summer
in a politically hip place called Iowa, a dozen or so Republicans
were asked which animal banks reminded them of.
</P>
<P>
   The answers opened a window on an issue that never goes away _
the way credit is dispensed in a society that needs it to grow and
prosper, and the continuing, strong public perception that this
crucial dispension remains rooted in unfairness and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The perceptions both mirror and clash with changing realities,
notes John Taylor, the Massachusetts activist who heads the
National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which coordinates the
activities of those battling for a level playing field.
</P>
<P>
   But down deep, adds the Boston-Washington commuter, ``The
American public believes that race and gender bias exist in the
banking industry, and in fact that is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the animals.
</P>
<P>
   Said two women in the Iowa discussion group, banks are lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think lions tend to think of themselves as king of the
jungle, controller of all,'' one said. ``I think when you generally
deal with a bank, that's a lot of times the feeling that you get.
And then again, the intimidation thing, the charges that we have no
control over, kind of like the smaller animal being eaten by that
lion.''
</P>
<P>
   Another GOP voter, male, picked an elephant: ``They're just very
big and don't pay attention to the smaller ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion or focus group (one of four the coalition held
around the country this year, including in equally pivotal
Manchester, N.H.) was part of a national study of public attitudes
toward banks that also included a polls of 800 voters, with
additional surveys of 200 African-Americans and 200 Hispanics. The
study was bipartisan, coordinated by Republican pollster Frank
Luntz and Democratic consultant Jennifer Laszlo, and consistently
revealing.
</P>
<P>
   The general public attitudes of intimidation and mistrust were
complemented in the polling results. Remember, they come just two
years after a federal study found blacks twice as likely as whites
to be turned down for loans without regard to income, with similar
research showing patterns of discrimination toward other minorities
and women. Some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   --Some 15 percent said they themselves or someone they know has
been discriminated against in applying for a loan.
</P>
<P>
   --Among blacks, the number was nearly twice that, or roughly
one-third. Of those who had personal or second-hand experiences to
relate, two-thirds said it was race, and not gender or income or
credit history, that was the cause.
</P>
<P>
   --73 percent of the whites said they had never been turned down,
almost a 20-point difference from Hispanics (52 percent) and blacks
(58 percent).
</P>
<P>
   --And by 5-1, white males were believed to have an absolute
advantage in the bank loan system. When asked if a white man and a
minority with the same credit history apply for a home mortgage or
small business loan, roughly half overall said they believe the
white male would be favored, while reverse discrimination believers
did not get outside of single digits. Needless to say, the results
were much more pronounced among minorities.
</P>
<P>
   --The poll also disclosed equally strong perceptions about
gender discrimination. Among whites, for example, voters by 60-8
percent believe that with two loan applications at issue, the male
would be more likely to get the dough. Elements of these
perceptions could also be found in attitudes about single-parent as
opposed to two-parent families.
</P>
<P>
   As a man in a Texas focus group put it, ``We really tend to look
at men as business people and women as cooks.''
</P>
<P>
   John Taylor's remark that a lot of these perceptions are at
variance with reality is instructive here. Ticking some of them
off, he noted that a person with a job has got huge odds in his or
her favor of getting credit. It's also true that the working poor
now have statistically documented, excellent track records in
making their loan payments; indeed, some in the industry believe
that good payment records vary inversely with income.
</P>
<P>
   It is further the case that the credit industry has been and is
changing rapidly for the better. There is much more sophistication
about loan products, about the potential of low-income people and
neighborhoods. And the smart institutions are becoming
astonishingly aggressive in their outreach.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still discrimination, a lot of it. Taylor believes
its roots are to be found in the same perceptions among lenders
that afflict the rest of the society _ the idea that there is
something negative associated with nonwhites, with women on their
own, with the foreign-born.
</P>
<P>
   At the national level, the recent rewrite of the banking laws
included a lease on life for the basic law in this area, the
Community Reinvestment Act. But the new law will also relax that
data collection requirements that have given responsible activists
like the NCRC the ammunition to demand change.
</P>
<P>
   The study released last week reminds us all that the battle
against discrimination and bigotry never ends, because the
conditions that breed it survive. It is encouraging and troubling
at the same time, and food for activism as well as thought.

COLUMNISTS' CHOICE: PIVOTAL FIGURES OF THE MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five Globe columnists were asked to write briefly about their
choices for the most important individual of the millennium. Their
selections:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL; 
DAVID NYHAN: William Shakespeare &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Choosing the most significant individual of the past 1,000 years
is in the nature of picking one atom out of all the planet's
molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Do you pick a conqueror? A ruler? A savant? A sage? An inventor?
Yes, all of those. William Shakespeare is my man for all 10
centuries, all 4,000 seasons. He conquered kingdoms, time, death,
with mere words, firing us with the ambition to do likewise. He
rules still over the human imagination, as no other this
millennium. Wise in the ways of the heart and the wiles of the
world, he handcrafted English as we came to know it, the language
for the world. No king, no commoner, no gravedigger, no damsel
demure, is immune to his powers. He was the Internet before the
Internet. He connected all our dots.
</P>
<P>
   He invented windows into the overlapping desktop of the inner
being, showing us how to keep peeling back the onion of life,
revealing ever and anew the layers that lie beneath the layers we
see. The Bard of Avon created the way we look inside ourselves.
Before psychology was named, or psychiatry invented, back when
potions were magical and not merely medical, he devised the
vocabulary for explaining life to those who have to live it.
</P>
<P>
   He mapped the realms of spirit and soul. Before anyone explained
the heavens, he elucidated the interior life of all who tread the
earth. He armed us with the words and the understanding to sip the
sweetness and sadness of our earthly span. He enobled with stirring
language the grinding routine of daily existence. He enabled us to
explain our baffling conflicts of instinct and desire to each
other, and to ourselves, if only we'll pay heed. He enriched not
just the theater, or the language, or the culture, but the context
in which we all live. He is the Universal Man, against whom no
barriers stand, as sustaining and invigorating to every race and
age as to languid English layabouts punting idly on the Isis.
</P>
<P>
   No adventurer, monarch, artist or thinker comes close to his
impact, if you measure the weight of burdens lifted from hearts and
minds by the timeless insights he hammered into the most evanescent
of art forms, stage dialogue. We are all players, on our common
stage. But he, more than any other, is the playwright who dictates
the script, no matter how highly endowed or lowly born our station.
</P>
<P>
   In war and peace, whether witnessing the tender ripening of
first love or the expiration of last breath, he gave us the
language and the light to lift our self-image out of the dust to
take its place up there, out there, freed from earthly bonds to
roam the firmament.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-------- &QC; 
 &QL; 
DERRICK Z. JACKSON: Prince Henry the Navigator &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal knew there was money to
be made in West Africa. The problem was how to get there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1415, Henry and his brothers conquered the Moroccan city of
Cueta. There, Henry heard of gold and black slaves in Guinea. He
wanted a sea route to this treasure.This was easier commanded than
done. Visions of the Atlantic Ocean south of the Canary Islands
were apocalyptic, with the sun supposedly turning white skin black
and the sea into fire.
</P>
<P>
   Henry did not sail himself but funded improvements in maps,
shipbuilding, and navigation, hence his nickname. But captains
remained spooked. From 1424 to 1434, 15 voyages failed to get past
the Canaries. Tired of excuses, Henry made Gil Eannes promise to
sail past a spot called Cape Bojador. Eannes reached it the cape
and found none of the horrors previously feared. Eannes pushed
farther south the next year and saw traces of people. By 1441,
captains Antao Goncalves and Nuno Tristao made it down to what
today is Mauritania. They traded with some Muslims and captured 12
black people.
</P>
<P>
   The number seemed insignificant. According to ``The Slave
Trade,'' by Hugh Thomas, they were captured more to show off to
Henry than to enslave. But upon the viewing, Henry obviously
salivated. His court chronicler, Gomes Eannes de Zurara, wrote:
``How great his joy must have been . . . not for the number of
those captives, but for the hope, O sainted Prince, you had for
others in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the captured Africans was a local chief who agreed to be
freed on the condition he lead the Portuguese back his homeland to
provide yet more slaves. Three years later, a ship went to a West
African village where the Portuguese ``attacked them, killing and
taking all they could.'' Some Africans drowned themselves rather
than be caught. The ship returned to Portugal with 235 slaves.
Zurara wrote, ``What heart could be so hard as not to be pierced
with piteous feeling to see that company?''
</P>
<P>
   The lament was a crocodile tear. During the next decade,
thousands of Africans were enslaved and the Atlantic slave trade,
the foundation for the economic might enjoyed 550 years later by
Europe and the United States, was begun.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States alone, the value of slave labor in modern
dollars has been calculated by economists to be $1.4 to $4.7
trillion. At the beginning of the new millennium, the average white
American baby boomer will inherit $65,000. The average
African-American baby boomer will inherit only $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Henry's joy, and the Western world's prosperity became great.
Most nations of color and most people of color in the diaspora
remain in a depleted and disparate state of disarray. Henry's
sailors discovered that the African sun did not turn their skins
black. But black skin became the black gold of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   (Help on this came from Ronald Bailey, professor of
African-American history at Northeastern University.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL; 
THOMAS OLIPHANT: Martin Luther &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hands down. Here's why.
</P>
<P>
   There was no more central question in the second millennium AD
than the status of the individual _ in the family, the group, the
church, the state, humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Before Martin Luther, the individual was lint. After Luther,
everything was different and possible.
</P>
<P>
   This copper miner's son worked through a wrenching crisis of
faith, refused to countenance the excesses of his all-powerful
church, and emerged with a fresh doctrine that put the individual
at its core after God _ a revolutionary proposition in theory and
in subsequent fact. It liberated people by the millions and also
killed people by the millions.
</P>
<P>
   This immensely influential body of thought is a hub. From it,
the spokes lead to modern democracy, to nationalism and markets,
even to expressive music and mass education. But the spokes also
lead to virulent anti-Semitism, the wild zeal of absolutists in
religion and government all claiming divine authority, and thus the
periodic eruptions ever since of all-out warfare that began in the
year of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Luther is the pivotal figure in a millennium about which
ambivalence is in order, the gene from which Jefferson and Hitler
were possible. His soaring hymn, ``A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,''
celebrates the power of the people as a congregation to express
their faith; but its seeds perverted in nationalism also sprouted
as ``Deutschland Uber Alles.''
</P>
<P>
   Luther was all of 34 when his doubts and his anger merged in
reaction to a friar traveling in his northern Germany, selling
indulgences to help pay for the completion of St. Peter's in Rome.
Who knows if he in fact nailed his 95 theses to the door of Castle
Church in Wittenberg, but his protest (the word would never be the
same) lit a lot of dry wood. Who knows for that matter if he really
uttered the famous declaration (``Here I stand, I cannot do
otherwise'') when summoned to recant before Emperor Charles V four
years later, but his refusal inspires to this day.

VISUAL ARTS: DEFINING THE LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a long-running show in London's West End, ``The Complete
Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged),'' which squeezes all the
Bard's plays into 97 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the equivalent condensation of 20th-century visual arts.
In the beginning, Paris ruled. Impressionism had paved the way for
other groundbreaking movements. Picasso and Matisse, titans who
remain unsurpassed in the century's painting, emerged, along with
Cubism and Fauvism.
</P>
<P>
   Europe retained a shaky sort of supremacy during and after World
War I, inventing Dada and Surrealism to deal with the unreality of
life. But the next conflagration left that life a complete
shambles. After World War II, the capital of the art world moved
from Paris to New York; some of Europe's leading avant-garde
artists had already made the leap. By 1950, Greenwich Village had
become what Montmartre had been half a century before. Abstract
Expressionism, Pop, and other modes were born and bought, the lag
time between the two steadily shortening, until, in the craziness
of the '80s, millionaires were putting themselves on waiting lists
for paintings by recent art-school grads.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last couple of decades, the notions that the art world
has a single capital and that art is based on a neat succession of
styles have faded. Diversity _ in geography, in media, and in just
about everything else _ is held up as the new god.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us up to now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Art is unavoidable
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of alternative histories, of course. (That's
what keeps the art book business booming.) Another way to look at
20th-century art is through the sheer proliferation of images. In
centuries past, you could avoid art. All you had to do, if you were
an average person without a private collection, was stay out of
museums and churches and away from the fancier areas of town where
you'd be confronted with sculpture in parks and plazas, and you'd
be safe.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, that changed. Endlessly reproduced, art is
now unavoidable. Monet and King Tut turn up on tea towels and on
the sides of buses, advertising the blockbuster shows that, like
the image glut, represent one of the radical shifts of the
20th-century art world. Mass market imagery goes beyond reproducing
masterpieces, though. Posters, billboards, and magazine ads became
as visually innovative as ``high'' art in the 20th century, and the
distinction between ``high'' and ``low'' has been worn down almost
to the point of meaninglessness.
</P>
<P>
   With advanced technology, the distinction between authentic art
and imitations has also blurred. The scariest example is the
Polaroid Replica, a substitute for real brand-name art for those
who can't afford it _ i.e., almost everybody. The Polaroid
duplicates the scale and even the texture of the original. One of
the things traditionally prized about a painting is its uniqueness;
does cloning devalue it? What's sad about Polaroid Replicas is that
for the same amount of money, you can go to an art-school sale and
buy something created by a human hand, head, and heart.
</P>
<P>
   Art now invades your home via the Internet, where you can
purchase paintings without having seen them in the flesh, or check
out a museum Web site that allows you to rotate a piece of
sculpture 360 degrees, viewing it from all sides. CD-ROMs have made
accessible some art that you can't really see even in situ. The
installation at Pennsylvania's Barnes Foundation, for instance, is
so eccentric that some paintings _ those hung high over doorways,
for instance _ are better seen on a computer screen, where you can
also enlarge and home in on details. Art created for the computer
screen is still in its infancy, though; maturity will have to wait
for the next century.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shifting definitions
</P>
<P>
   For most of our century, there was faith in progress in art just
as there was in progress in the American economy. One thing would
always lead to another, and things would always get better. That's
the way art and art history were taught. Then, with the Vietnam
era, those certainties eroded.
</P>
<P>
   Definitions and demarcations began to shift. With the Happenings
of the 1960s, performing and visual arts merged _ an extension of
their joint ventures earlier in the century, under the auspices of
the impresario Serge Diaghilev. Multimedia collaborations among
giants such as John Cage, Merce Cunningham, and Robert Rauschenberg
constituted some of the most exciting art of the day. With
performance art, the boundaries between disciplines blurred
further, until you couldn't say who was the choreographer and who
designed the decor. Everybody tried everything.
</P>
<P>
   By the '60s, visual art was no longer a tidy progression of
styles in painting and sculpture. Painting in oils and sculpture in
bronze or marble weren't necessarily where the action was anyway.
In 1917, Marcel Duchamp had decreed that a urinal he dubbed
``Fountain'' was in fact sculpture; more recently, there has been a
flood of bathroom art, including Robert Gober's sinks and Kiki
Smith's crouching female urinating glass beads. Any material can be
made into art, and any subject can as well.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most ambitious categories of art in the second half of
the century was the Earthwork, which attempted nothing less than
altering the topography of the planet. Robert Smithson's 1,500-foot
black basalt ``Spiral Jetty,'' which curls its way into the Great
Salt Lake, is a tangible epic, an homage to myths about the lake's
origins, and an on-again, off-again presence, depending on the
rising and falling of the water. Is a work like ``Spiral Jetty''
really new? It's not much of a stretch to trace Earthworks back to
Stonehenge and before.
</P>
<P>
   Sculpture in neon, video, and light itself is another important
development of the late 20th century. Some work based on new
technology initially looked like science projects run amok, carried
away with whizbang gimmickry. A lot of it matured most
gratifyingly, though. Video artist Bill Viola, for instance, has
conquered technical difficulties to create grand-scale, weightless
images of birth and death, fire and rain, the elements of
existence. Bruce Nauman, who has worked in many media, including
himself, bathes those who venture into his quirky spaces in neon
light. James Turrell has spent more than two decades reshaping
Roden Crater, an Arizona volcano, into a place that frames and
concentrates light from sun, moon, and stars.
</P>
<P>
   There's an idealism in Turrell's megaproject, which no one will
ever buy. But the century has also seen plenty of art greed. The
art market boiled over in the 1980s, the hysteria exemplified by
the fate of van Gogh's ``Irises,'' sold at Sotheby's in 1987 for a
then-record $53.4 million. The buyer was Australian entrepreneur
Alan Bond, who, it turned out, couldn't afford the painting.
Sotheby's, which had lent him half the money in a move denounced as
ethically dubious, reclaimed it and sold it once more, this time to
the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The world's richest museum, the
Getty can afford anything _ although, of course, not everything is
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting in the 20th century has been degraded by the
commodification of art. Gone are the days when
collector-intellectuals such as Gertrude Stein and her clan from
America, and the Shchukin and Morozov families from Russia,
converged on Paris to compete for still-wet canvases by Picasso and
Matisse. Now we've got buyers like British ad tycoon Charles
Saatchi, who scoops up a museum's worth of new art only to dump it
on the market a few years later, sending some of the artists into
spirals of depression.

   The photo revolution
</P>
<P>
   The granddaddy of the technology that is revamping art on what
seems an almost daily basis is photography, a 19th-century
invention that continued to change visual experience profoundly and
permanently through the 20th. Photography revolutionized the
practice of art history, through the color slide. It led to one of
the century's biggest publishing phenomena, the lavishly
illustrated coffee-table art book. Aerial photography helped free
painters from the horizon line. And photography brought other media
to broad public attention: Hans Namuth's photographs of Jackson
Pollock dancing around his studio splashing paint helped build the
legend of ``Jack the Dripper.''
</P>
<P>
   From Edward Steichen to Cindy Sherman, photography in the 20th
century grew from an art that imitated painting to one capable of
all kinds of tricks painting couldn't perform. Photography entered
the unlimited realm of ``mixed media.'' The pristine print was no
longer the goal. Artists once hand-colored black-and-white
photographs to make them look ``real''; now they paint them for
other reasons, and even bend them into sculpture. The 20th century
has also seen the development of play-acting in photography, from
F. Holland Day posing as the crucified Christ at the beginning of
the century to the contemporary Japanese artist Yasumasa Morimura
inserting his obviously Asian face into reproductions of paintings
by Titian, Rembrandt, and van Gogh. Photography made bigger strides
in the 20th century than either painting or sculpture, pace the
advent of abstraction. (The abstract photograph came along, too.)

<P>
   Abstraction is what many would cite as the defining feature of
20th-century art as we know it in the West. But that's murky
territory: Islamic painting, for instance, has been abstract for
centuries. The identity of the painter of the first completely
nonrepresentational canvas in the West in the early years of the
20th century is uncertain. It may have been the Russian Kasimir
Malevich, or the American Arthur Dove. What is clear is that
paintings that confined themselves to a single hue or geometric
motif opened the floodgates of possibility: Art was no longer tied
to observable reality; color and shape could exist independently.
</P>
<P>
   Abstraction also opened the floodgates of ridicule. People had
lampooned Impressionism in the 19th century. But in the 20th, the
divide between advanced art and the general public widened. There
were loads of ``You-call-that-art?'' controversies, centered around
religion, sex, or even, in the case of Damien Hirst's pickled
sharks and goats, accusations of cruelty to animals. There were
jokes about the ``hoax'' of Minimalism, a '60s style that has worn
better than anything else in the second half of the century. It's
Minimalism's contemporary, Color Field Painting, that, at century's
end, looks like just so much wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Hostilities between the art world and a skeptical public
escalated through the 1900s. Never before had ordinary people in
such large numbers felt so alienated from art, felt they didn't
``get'' it. This happened, ironically, even as the art world
increasingly co-opted ordinary people's turf. Consider Warhol's
soup cans.
</P>
<P>
   Another way visual artists have edged closer to everyday life is
to design functional, albeit often utopian, environments: Examples
are Andrea Zittel's ``Living Units'' and ``Pit Beds'' and Joep van
Lieshout's mobile homes that range from decadent to austere. Many
artists who yearn to be useful work in traditional ``craft'' areas.
There's been a late-century resurgence in glass, ceramics, and
handmade furniture, some by ``crossover'' artists trained in
``fine'' art. Their work answers a craving, in an age of
mechanization and mass production, for the handmade and unique.
</P>
<P>
   Scale became a signature of modern art. Early in the century,
Monet's paintings blanketed whole walls, as Abstract Expressionist
canvases did 50 years later. Later, art got even larger, whether it
was Christo wrapping the Reichstag, the vast Cor-ten steel
sculptures of Richard Serra, Rauschenberg's ``The 1/4 Mile or 2
Furlong Piece,'' or Maya Lin's haunting Vietnam War memorial, a low
black granite wall snaking its way into the earth. Lin's 1980
monument acts as balm on a century's worth of angry political art,
from Leon Golub's brutal paintings of torturers and their victims
to the Socialist Realism imposed on artists in Communist countries.

<P>
   The blockbuster exhibition
</P>
<P>
   Art on a huge scale, and the advent of the blockbuster
exhibition that drew huge numbers, were dual impetuses behind the
20th century's museum-building boom. Existing art museums sprawled
ever larger, adding new wing after new wing. The truism about
architecturally splashy new museums is that the building counts as
the biggest work in its collection.
</P>
<P>
   Museums were relatively staid places before the advent of the
blockbuster, epitomized by the 1972 ``Treasures of Tutankhamen'' at
New York's Metropolitan Museum, staged by that great showman Thomas
Hoving. A quarter-century later, the appetite for big-budget
big-name shows had increased to the point that tickets for a
particular time of day had to be ordered in advance. Impressionism,
Egypt, ancient gold from practically anywhere, all are reliably big
at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbusters can be cynical displays of whatever museum
development departments think the public wants to see. Or they can
be breathtaking, bringing together works that will never, within a
single lifetime, share the same space again. The 1995 Vermeer show
organized by the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., and the
Mauritshuis in The Hague is a case of the latter, with most of that
master's slim output under one roof for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeer became an art star only in the 20th century; before
that, he'd been a ``lost'' painter, then a rediscovered one. The
notion of an art star is largely a 20th-century invention, with
Picasso the brightest in the firmament. Later artists, including
Warhol and Jeff Koons, made stardom a primary goal; art was merely
a means. They themselves became art.
</P>
<P>
   The museum building also achieved celebrity status. Projects
like the Grand Louvre in Paris or the vast branch that London's
Tate Gallery will open in a former power station on the Thames next
spring make headlines. Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain is
a twirling titanium pirouette that has quickly become the city's
symbol. Richard Meier's Getty Center is an arrogant, austere,
off-putting, off-white pile overlooking Los Angeles. I. M. Pei's
Miho Museum in Shiga, Japan, is the best thing he's ever done, and
one of the most humble, most of it built underneath a national
park. Stephen Holl's Kiasma museum in Helsinki is a curvaceous,
futuristic masterpiece for the electronic age. Thousands of people
make pilgrimages to these buildings; many go with little thought of
what's inside.
</P>
<P>
   Museums are being designed to accommodate not only existing
collections and new ones, but also the rewriting of art history.
African or Native American art that once was relegated to the
dioramas of ethnographic museums is now entering museums of fine
arts. Museums that once smugly identified themselves as
``encyclopedic'' are realizing they're not, and hastening to
acquire, say, South American art.
</P>
<P>
   There are endless curatorial debates over how to display and
categorize art that plays by different rules than those that
prevail in the West. Some African cultures, for instance, value
tradition and continuity over innovation and artistic ``progress,''
so a 100-year-old object will look like one made today. How does a
museum convey that idea? Should contemporary Asian art go in a
department devoted to contemporary art from around the world, or in
one that traces the development of Asian art from its origins to
now? Should departments be divvied up according to geography, era,
or medium? Defining ``contemporary art'' has proven particularly
tricky. And a few years back, museums with departments of
20th-century art started nervously looking ahead to the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The canon is expanding _ and fast. The standard joke about
``Outsider Art,'' subject of a slew of museum shows in the past
decade, is that it's now ``In.'' Since its first publication in
1962, H. W. Janson's ``History of Art,'' the premiere college text
on the subject, has undergone regular revisions, most notably to
add women and African-American artists. Those two groups, and
minorities in general, are still pitifully underrepresented in
museum collections and in high-profile exhibitions, though. We're
not yet over the cult of the Dead White Male.
</P>
<P>
   While Western museums scramble to acquire art from corners of
the world they didn't used to consider, some of those corners are
developing into important centers themselves. Sao Paulo,
Johannesburg, and Istanbul now hold respected biennials. There are
pockets of cutting-edge artists all over the globe; in countries
where governments still dictate art's content and style, some
survive underground. Some Western governments, most notably ours,
have little power to control art because they're unwilling to fund
it. For the most part, art in America has to pay its own way: Hence
the $17.50 ticket to the blockbuster show.
</P>
<P>
   The world's museums are winding up the century with a lot of
apologies for housing Nazi loot, and art whisked out of Third World
countries under dubious legal circumstances. There's a lot of
defiance, too. War and Colonialism mixed up what went where.
Sorting it all out is impossible; making the effort is a moral
imperative. At the beginning of the 19th century, the seventh Earl
of Elgin brought great marble figures from the Parthenon to
Britain. At the close of the 20th, a leading British newspaper, The
Guardian, has broken ranks and called for their return.

IT'S NOT EASY TO GET A TREE IN THE HOLY LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ We just wanted to buy a Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   My 2 1/2-year-old son, Will, is starting to get the idea of the
holiday season. And when his mother asked him what to put on his
wish list for Santa Claus, a tree was No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A Christmas tree in the Holy Land. Nice image, especially this
year as Christianity celebrates its third millennium in the land
where it began.
</P>
<P>
   Well, we had no idea what we were in for.
</P>
<P>
   In this arid land of conflict and memory, even Christmas trees
bend with the weight of history.
</P>
<P>
   Many religious Jews here view them not as a warm holiday
tradition, but as a pagan German symbol that speaks of a menacing
past. The Chief Rabbinate even ruled it would rescind the
``kashrut,'' or kosher certification, of any hotel displaying one
in its lobby, a move that would put a hotel out of business.
</P>
<P>
   So I called Rabbi Yaakov Sabag, chief of the kosher division of
Israel's rabbinate to find out how a yuletide fir would violate
Jewish dietary laws.
</P>
<P>
   His reponse was, ``There are some Jews who find the Christmas
tree offensive. It is a symbol, a symbol like a swastika . . . a
symbol of the grave history of Christianity in relation to
Judaism.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa! We're just talking about a Christmas tree here, right?
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli friends, religious and secular alike, assured us
this rabbinical ruling was absurd. To them it was one more
infuriating example of the Chief Rabbinate overextending its
authority. My neighbor, the learned theologian Rabbi David Hartman,
called it ``just plain stupid'' and was indignant at the image of
intolerance it projected for Christian tourists and residents.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Uri Mor, who handles relations with the Christian
community for Israel's Religious Affairs Ministry, if he thought
this Christmas tree ban was a sign of intolerance. He did not
really answer.
</P>
<P>
   But he informed me that the Jewish National Fund provides free
Christmas trees as a gift to all foreign correspondents. The Globe
does not like us taking gifts, so that was out.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Palestinian friends pointed out that the Jewish
National Fund carries its own historical baggage. Since the
founding of Israel the JNF was the powerful agency carrying out
``land reclamation,'' as Israelis refer to it, or, in some
instances, ``land confiscation,'' as the Palestinians call it.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so what about going up to see our kibbutz friend, Uri
Zelzion. Perhaps he would allow us into their beautiful orchards to
take a small tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' he shouted. ``You don't cut down trees in Israel, you
plant them.''
</P>
<P>
   Chopping down a perfectly healthy sapling pine tree, to put it
mildly, cuts against the grain of Zionism. For the Zionist
movement, trees are a kind of religion all their own, with an army
of believers in Jewish congregations throughout America who pay $10
to plant a tree in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, we were confused. And desperate.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Julie, Will, his little brother, Ry, and I set out for
the 10-minute drive through the military checkpoints and pot-holed
roads that lead to Bethlehem, where the real Nativity story took
place.
</P>
<P>
   There my wife and I did what we never thought we'd do in our
lives. We bought a fake Christmas tree. The kind that comes in a
box and has to be assembled. Buying a simulated pine in a town with
such a profoundly real connection to the Nativity story made the
experience even more humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   Our sons, who actually loved the fake Christmas tree store, were
mesmerized by the blinking lights and shiny bulbs on the floor
models. We chose a ``Fox Tail Fir'' complete with plastic pine
cones. At $50, we made a healthy contribution to the suffering
Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
   We brought it home. We struggled to assemble it, and we had fun
decorating it. In the end, it looked enough like the trees our son
had been drawing in nursery school. He loves it. And in the end,
that's what a Christmas tree, real or plastic, is all about.

JEWISH COMMUNITY ADAPTS TO ITS DOMINICAN HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOSUA, Dominican Republic _ Midway through the Shabbat service,
after belting out Judaism's most sacred prayer, Benny Katz uttered
several words that most Jews would say qualify him as Christian.
</P>
<P>
   With his son shaking a scratchy-sounding noisemaker, his niece
jamming on a keyboard and other relatives on a tambourine and on
drums, Katz, accompanied by a bouncy merengue beat, blew into a
ram's horn and asked his small congregation to repeat after him:
</P>
<P>
   ``Glorious is Jesus. He is our God!'' he chanted, dancing among
15 answering congregants along rows of assembled lawn chairs on an
open-air patio next to his home. ``Hallelujah, Jesus. We are
following your path.''
</P>
<P>
   Few statements so succinctly show the assimilation of the
second- and third-generation remnants of the once-thriving Jewish
community here, historically important because it was accepted in
this Caribbean nation when other countries such as the United
States turned their back on Jewish migrants during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Katz is the son of one of the first of 645 Jews to immigrate
during World War II to the Dominican Republic's north coast.
Thousands more who received Dominican visas left Europe and
illegally entered countries such as the United States and
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   While Katz's father's family was never very religious, they were
traditional Jews who kept the High Holy Days and believed that the
messiah has yet to come. Katz, however, said he believes Jesus was
and will be the messiah.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of assimilation is common worldwide, specialists
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not worried about there being some assimilation,'' said
Benno Weiser Varon, a Jewish history professor at Boston University
who once served at the Israeli ambassador to the Dominican
Republic. ``In Latin America, this is a minority. There is a strong
Jewish community in South America, especially in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would accept them as Jewish, even though some very
Orthodox rabbis might not.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many descendants of the pioneering Jews who in 1940 began
taming this patch of raw, tropical jungle into arable land, Katz
married a non-Jewish Dominican. Today, however, his wife, Alicia,
wears Star of David earrings and leads Shabbat services, singing
prayers in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   She considers herself and her children Jewish, although she has
not formally converted. There are now only a few more than 70 Jews
or those who consider themselves Jews living in Sosua, and nearly a
quarter belong to the Jews for Jesus sect. Most of the others are
secular.
</P>
<P>
   Other than posting traditional mezuzas _ small cases containing
a Biblical verse _ on the doors of their homes, they exhibit few
signs of their religion. Katz sees no contradiction between the
mingling of Catholic and Jewish traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just as Jewish as anyone else who believes in the
Torah,'' said Katz, 36, a mechanic and motorcycle racer, who wears
the traditional skull cap and shawl during the services his family
holds each week. ``We just believe Christ is our savior.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz's 82-year-old father, Martin, one of only two of the
initial Jewish refugees remaining in Sosua, is not concerned about
his son's deviation from tradition. Nor is Martin Katz's friend,
Arturo Kirchheiman, 91, the other pioneer still living here, who
jokingly calls himself ``the godfather of Sosua,'' because he
helped develop the town and make it a tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   Both smiled and shrugged when asked about Benny Katz's
nontraditional beliefs. To the two elderly pioneers, both of whom
married Catholics and at one time raised pigs to sell as pork
throughout the Dominican Republic, assimilation is part of the
community's natural evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son and his son were bar mitzvahed,'' said Martin Katz, who
still speaks Spanish with a German accent. His son and grandson did
their bar mitzvah with a rabbi visiting from elsewhere in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's enough. Our traditions will continue, even if they
change some,'' Katz added. ``But the Jewish community's future in
Sosua is not bright. There are so few of us left.''
</P>
<P>
   With only 63 cents in his pocket, Martin Katz arrived in Sosua
on an Italian ship after fleeing his home near Frankfurt. Before
departing from Genoa, Italy, in 1940, the 22-year-old clothing
designer had little idea where the Dominican Republic was. He knew,
however, that he was one of the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, Kirchheiman, at age 32, sailed from
Portugal on the third of nearly a dozen ships that ferried European
Jews to Sosua. Months had passed since he had escaped from his
Hamburg home, a time passed in hunger, imprisonment, and
negotiations for his freedom with German forces in southern France.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, Kirchheiman, and thousands of other Jews mainly from
Germany and Austria benefited when the Dominican dictator Rafael
Trujillo declared his government would issue 5,000 visas to the
stranded European Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo's generosity _ when no other nation would welcome
Jewish refugees _ remains a mystery. Three years earlier, the
Dominican leader had ordered 30,000 Haitians killed in an effort to
halt the mainly mulatto Dominican population from becoming
darker-skinned. The Jews here say he either wanted to atone for his
bloodshed or to help ``whiten'' the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jews arrived, with help from international Jewish
organizations, each settler was given 80 acres of land, 10 cows, a
mule, and a horse. Although many of them had no background in
farming, they learned quickly. Today, Productos Sosua, the Jewish
cooperative for which Katz and Kirchheiman worked for many years,
produces most of the Dominican Republic's meat and dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success in overcoming a dense jungle and surviving
multiple strains of malaria, typhoid, and other debilitating
diseases, Sosua's Jewish community may not be able to surmount the
more benign obstacles of assimilation and migration.
</P>
<P>
   While the community is refurbishing its little-used synagogue
and a small museum preserves the early settlers' history, Sosua has
evolved from a small farming town to become one of the Dominican
Republic's centers of tourism. The tourists, many of whom are
German, come to enjoy Sosua's beach and aquamarine bay.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Jews who arrived here and their descendants have
moved to the capital, Santo Domingo, or immigrated to Miami and New
York. Only 300 Jews remain throughout the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Benny and Alicia Katz, despite their belief in Jesus and the New
Testament, say they are upholding his father's traditions,
observing Shabbat on Friday nights and High Holy Days such as Yom
Kippur, the Day of Atonement, and Rosh Hashonah, the Jewish New
Year.
</P>
<P>
   Benny only recently found Jesus. Driving home a few years ago on
one of the Dominican Republic's perilous mountain roads, Katz said
he had heard strange voices in his head telling him he would not
make it back to Sosua.
</P>
<P>
   So he called on Jesus for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Jesus, if you help me get home safely, I will serve
you the rest of my life,' '' Katz said. ``It's what has kept our
family together.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush is proud to call himself ``the
law-and-order governor.'' And rightly so. In five years in office,
he has overseen the executions of 113 death row inmates, more than
any other governor in any state since the death penalty was
reinstated in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But the relentless efficiency of his state's death row machinery
is about to intersect, vividly, with Bush's pursuit of his party's
presidential nomination. In the five weeks before the Iowa and New
Hampshire presidential contests, Texas is scheduled to execute
eight more people, among them convicts whose cases put the debate
about the death penalty into high relief.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the eight committed their crimes as juveniles. One claims
to have been convicted on the basis of a faulty DNA test. One is a
paranoid schizophrenic whose condition went untreated _ until he
killed.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Johnny Paul Penry.
</P>
<P>
   Even supporters of capital punishment have been troubled by the
Penry case. There is no excusing his heinous crime: In 1979, while
on parole for a previous rape conviction, he broke into the home of
Pamela Carpenter, raped her, and then stabbed her to death with the
scissors she was using to make a Halloween costume for her niece.
</P>
<P>
   But Penry has the intellectual capacity of a 7-year-old. He
never got past the first grade and spent his childhood years in and
out of mental institutions. Court records describe how his mother
beat him as a baby and dipped him in scalding water. She forced him
to eat his bodily wastes, according to those records.
</P>
<P>
   Penry's execution is sure to gain national attention, for it was
in his case in 1989 that the US Supreme Court issued a
controversial ruling that the death penalty for retarded
individuals is not a constitutionally prohibited ``cruel and
unusual punishment.'' He is scheduled to die by lethal injection on
Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not spoken publicly about the Penry case and, in
keeping with his normal practice, he would not examine the facts of
the case until the date set for execution. Bush has never granted
such a reprieve. And it was the governor's opposition last spring
that led to the scuttling of a bill that passed one house of the
Texas Legislature. It would have banned executions of the mentally
retarded.
</P>
<P>
   The case of another Texas convict, Larry Robison, who has been
diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, poses another issue: whether
the mentally ill should be executed. In a bloody rampage, Robison
slaughtered two men, two women, and an 11-year-old boy near Fort
Worth in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Before he launched his murderous spree by decapitating and
sexually mutilating his male housemate, Robison had no history of
violence. His illness had been diagnosed when he was 21, but he was
turned away from treatment because he lacked health insurance. He
has requested Jan. 21 as an execution date, because he wants to die
on a night of a full moon.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled executions of Glen McGinnis (Jan. 25) and Anzel
Jones (Jan. 26) and David Hicks (Jan. 20) offer other windows onto
the death penalty and how determinedly Texas and Bush enforce it.
McGinnis and Jones were both juveniles, 17 years old, when they
committed their brutal crimes. Hicks, meanwhile, claims that faulty
DNA analysis helped convict him of a crime he did not commit _ the
rape and murder of his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty has not yet emerged as a campaign issue in a
nation where roughly two of three voters, and three of four
Republicans, endorse the practice. Here in Texas, the most
prominent victims' rights organization speaks for many when giving
Bush its whole-hearted support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has been a very receptive and reasonable
governor when it comes to issues of crime and criminal justice,''
said Dianne Clements, president of Justice for All, the
Houston-based victims group. ``There is poll after poll that proves
the citizens of Texas support the death penalty, the ultimate
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clements defends the use of the death penalty, even in those
cases where the offender was 17 at the time of the crime, or
mentally disabled. ``If they are competent to be convicted, then so
be it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But death penalty opponents contend that Bush's record-setting
embrace of capital punishment may yet be a negative factor for him
in the 2000 election. He shows a callousness, they say, toward the
solemn issues that arise from government's ultimate power: taking
the life of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the overall support given to capital punishment in the
polls, ``the realization is growing that the death penalty, like a
lot of other things that government does, has serious problems,''
said Stephen Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human
Rights in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``People reasonably expect that the governor of Texas ought to
be concerned about executing the mentally retarded, or those who
had poor legal representation,'' said Bright. ``If you are going to
be executing those who were children when they committed the crime,
or people who are mentally ill, the governor ought to at least be
engaged. You don't get the sense that Bush is engaged at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush reinforced such doubts when, in a magazine interview last
summer, he mocked the eleventh-hour plea for mercy by a convicted
double murderer, Karla Faye Tucker, imitating her by whimpering
``Please, don't kill me'' with pursed lips.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, whose born-again faith and repentance for her crimes was
cited in requests for mercy made to Bush by such figures as Pope
John Paul II and televangelist Pat Robertson, was the first woman
to be executed by the state of Texas since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   And in a recent case that spurred headlines across the country,
Texas authorities used an airplane and a team of medical attendants
to fly David Long from the intensive care ward of a Galveston
hospital to the death chamber in Huntsville on Dec. 8 so he could
be executed on his appointed date. He had tried to commit suicide
by taking an overdose of anti-psychotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting him on life support and flying him out of the hospital
so they can kill him? People are asking, `What the hell are they
doing down there?' '' said George Kendall, who heads the NAACP's
death penalty project in New York. ``There is a growing volume of
cases in Texas that make it sound like however the system is
supposed to work, this is not it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the well-publicized releases of dozens of death
row inmates found innocent by DNA testing has sparked a national
movement for a moratorium on capital punishment, and led to a
slight downtick in support for the practice in public opinion
polls, foes of the death penalty hope to use the upcoming primary
season to publicize their cause and pressure Bush to intervene on
behalf of those scheduled to die.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's legislative record raises further issues. Despite
repeated judicial criticism of the way that Texas provides legal
services to indigent defendants in capital punishment and other
criminal cases _ via a court-appointed patronage system _ Bush
vetoed a bill that would have reformed the system and established
an independent public defender's office this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter on the death penalty in his campaign autobiography,
Bush says that he treats his ``profound'' responsibility in capital
punishment cases ``thoughtfully and carefully,'' but that he limits
his decisions on whether to intervene to two matters: ``Is there
any doubt about this individual's guilt or innocence? And, have the
courts had ample opportunity to review all the legal issues in this
case?''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of political philosophy, Bush says, he does not
believe he has the right to ``replace the verdict of a jury with my
own'' in order to show mercy, or for potentially mitigating factors
like age, mental illness, or mental retardation.

 AUSTIN, Texas: ... mental retardation.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I support the death penalty because I believe, if administered
swiftly and justly, capital punishment is a deterrent against
future violence and will save other innocent lives,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, as governor, is the only candidate who has to concern
himself with particular death penalty cases, but he is far from
alone in his general views. All five of his Republican adversaries
support the death penalty, as do Vice President Al Gore and former
Senator Bill Bradley, the two men squaring off in the Democratic
primaries. Bush's Democratic opponents in the last two
gubernatorial elections each sought to show that they were tough on
crime by enthusiastically endorsing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is strong support for capital punishment in Texas,''
said Tony Fabelo, who as director of the Texas Criminal Justice
Policy Council serves as the Texas governor's top adviser on
criminal justice issues. And Fabelo said Bush is no one-trick pony,
and should be credited for the way that his reform of the juvenile
justice system and his ambitious prison construction program have
helped cut the Texas crime rate and modernize its institutions.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP pollster, William McInturff, who conducts public opinion
surveys for the campaign of Senator John McCain of Arizona, said
the governor risks little damage in approving the executions in
January. The electorate's general position on capital punishment,
said McInturff, is akin to that of one voter who told the pollster,
``I'll tell you where I stand on the death penalty: right next to
the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting how President Clinton showed he was tough on crime during
the 1992 campaign by approving the execution of Rickey Ray Rector,
a mentally retarded Arkansas man, McInturff said that the only
political risk when applying the death penalty is ``that you don't
want to appear you are being glib with that responsibility.'' And
after the fallout over his comments about the Tucker case,
McInturff said, ``I'm sure governor Bush is most attuned to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Texas has a system of government that curbs the
governor's power, Bush can technically give a death row inmate just
a 30-day reprieve from execution. But he appoints the Texas Board
of Pardons and Paroles, which has the authority to grant clemency
requests and commute sentences and has never varied from Bush's
position on the 113 executions and one act of clemency during his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has the authority, though he has never had to use it, to
overrule an act of clemency by the board. ``My appointees . . .
reflect my no-nonsense approach to crime and punishment,'' Bush
said. In the single case of clemency, Bush and the board agreed
with the Texas attorney general that crazed serial killer Henry Lee
Lucas had made a phony confession to the 1979 rape and strangling
of an unidentified woman for which he was sentence to death.
</P>
<P>
   The probation and parole board holds no public hearings, votes
by phone or fax, and does not explain its reasoning. The secretive
and casual nature with which the board makes decisions spurred one
federal judge last year to call it ``appalling'' and ``incredible''
and an ``extremely poor'' process.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Texas system of having elected judges appoint
their favorite lawyers for impoverished defendants was called a
``farce'' and a ``travesty'' by another federal judge after a
series of abuses _ including defense lawyers who slept in court or
abused cocaine _ came to light last year. The problem was
exacerbated when the federal government cut off all funds to
resource centers that provided help to death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush publicly defended the state's clemency and indigent defense
systems. He vetoed the bill to create a new public defender's
office, and without his support the proposed legislation to reform
the clemency process died in this year's legislature, along with
the bill to ban executions of the mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the tangential ways Bush helps create an
atmosphere,'' said Maurie A. Levin, an Austin lawyer who represents
death row inmates. ``To me, killing a retarded guy and a juvenile
in the same month when you are running for national election says a
lot about you.''

   ``I just voted against a national day of prayer, fasting and
`humiliation before God,''' says Loretta Sanchez, rolling her eyes
as she walks off the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.
``These are the votes we're taking these days: `I can hang up more
commandments than you can.'''
</P>
<P>
   The California Democrat is disgusted, yes, but three years after
a vicious campaign battle with one of the loudest voices in
American conservatism, Bob Dornan, Sanchez also finds her
right-wing opponents strangely amusing. Even Helen Chenoweth, the
pro-militia congresswoman from Idaho who called for that national
day of ``humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a wacko. But she probably meant `humility,''' says
Sanchez, who's willing to give Chenoweth the benefit of the doubt
because ``it's part of being Catholic. We always feel guilty, and
we always wear a slip.''
</P>
<P>
   Petite, flirtatious and easy to underestimate, Sanchez, 39, has
gone from being a political unknown largely written off by the
Democratic establishment to co-chairman of the party.
</P>
<P>
   She's also high on Hillary Rodham Clinton's list of pals to help
campaign in New York's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever got anywhere by slaying an ant,'' says Clinton
campaign strategist James Carville, ``and she's a dragon killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez proved her feistiness in 1996, when she ousted Dornan
from his House seat by fewer than 1,000 votes. Stunned by his loss
after 10 terms, Dornan convinced the Republican leadership to
launch a congressional inquiry, with an idea of throwing Sanchez
out of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost me $800,000 to win my first election and another
million dollars to hold onto my seat,'' she says of the 17-month
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Dornan came up with proof that more than 500 noncitizens had
voted, but unable to prove the election results wrong, the
Republicans dropped the charges. Then Sanchez whipped Dornan again
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez is generating less buzz about her legislative program _
as a junior member, she doesn't have much of an agenda to speak of
_ than about her ability to ignite the Hispanic vote, which could
play a key role in a presidential race between Vice President Al
Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   She admits that getting the growing demographic group to the
polls is a challenge, because, she says, ``a lot of Hispanics come
from a system where politics is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez's own father, based on his experience growing up in
Mexico, warned her against running for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good politicians get shot,'' he told her, ``and the bad ones
are bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Married for 10 years to securities trader Stephen Brixey,
Sanchez holds an MBA from American University and got her early
education compliments of the Great Society's antipoverty program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a Head Start kid, but I never realized I was poor,'' she
insists, smiling demurely as she moves in to attack. ``I didn't
know the program was aimed at the disadvantaged until 1993, when I
read in the paper about the Republicans not wanting to fund it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Sanchez's reputation for such sugarcoated toughness that
makes her a favorite with Democrats and moderate Republicans alike,
and she has wasted no time making powerful friends.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo gushes, ``She's junior in terms
of time served in Congress, but she's senior in terms of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore gave her the cushy job of helping dispense money to
candidates from his PAC. But she bristles when asked whether the
vice president is entitled to next year's nomination by dint of his
eight years served.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't go to Al Gore just by virtue of inheritance,''
she says. ``You're talking to a person who nobody thought would
win, especially not in the primary, when the party was helping
someone else. As a Democratic chairperson, my role is to ensure
those people who want to run have the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sanchez admits the vice president needs to loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's in my district, he's not stiff,'' she says. ``But
then I turn on CSPAN and see him campaigning in New Hampshire and I
say, `Oh my God, what is this guy doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez is anxiously awaiting next summer's Democratic
convention in Los Angeles _ politics aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only been to one before, in Chicago in 1996,'' she
recalls. But as a dark horse, she adds, ``I didn't get to see any
of the fun stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Sanchez will be getting invitations to all the best
parties, along with Barbra Streisand, Rob Reiner, Warren Beatty and
Annette Bening _ all of whom contributed to her second race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean I can pick up the phone and say, `Hi, I'm
Loretta. Can you come over and do a concert now, Barbra?''' she
says, pausing to consider her own celebrity status. ``But I'm sure
some of them would say yes.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Calvin Klein has another musical production on his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, once again, there will be hardly a super in sight _
with the exception of Christy Turlington for underwear. The CK
Calvin Klein Jeans campaign, shot again by Steven Klein, features
cutting-edge musicians who are not household names yet, but are
making waves in the music scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Calvin Klein Jeans ads are still edgy, contemporary and
not mass,'' said Calvin Klein, in a recent interview at his office.
The ads are built around Klein's new ``Dirty Denim'' collection,
which hits stores this month.
</P>
<P>
   While Klein declined to discuss his spring print budget for CK
Jeans, CK Collection, Calvin Klein Collection and Accessories and
Underwear, he said the print buy is even with last year, but he'll
spend slightly more overall with additional outdoor, postcards and
online banner ads.
</P>
<P>
   Among the musicians featured in the jeans campaign are Joshua
Todd of Buck Cherry, a punk and hard rock blues band; Lisa (Left
Eye) Lopez of TLC, who is coming out with her own solo album; Macy
Gray, a rhythm and blues and soul artist; David Silveria of Korn, a
hard-core rock band; and Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley of
Ash, a U.K. group.
</P>
<P>
   There's also Moby, a techno artist; Shakira, a Latin-American
pop-rock singer and songwriter; Delores O'Riordan of the
Cranberries; D.J. Rap, a U.K. deejay; and Ja Rule, a hard-core
rapper who plays the lead in Madonna's upcoming movie, ``Ghetto
Superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads were shot in a New York studio, using a variety of
striking backgrounds, ranging from colorful sunsets and mountains
to bolts of lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said that while fashion designers may have their own brand
of hang-ups and attitudes about who they're grouped with in certain
situations, musicians are even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have tremendous attitudes about who's cool and who's
not,'' said Klein, adding that many wanted to know who else was in
the campaign before they agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very aware of who else is doing this campaign,'' said
Klein. The designer said he wanted to limit the campaign to people
``who are critically well accepted, but are just not that well
known.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he think being in the Calvin Klein campaign will help their
budding musical careers?
</P>
<P>
   ``If it does, great. I think people are doing it to be a part of
it. They think it's fun and cool. And we think they're so cool and
talented.''
</P>
<P>
   And what budding rocker or rapper wouldn't want a double-page
spread of themselves in a fashion, music, entertainment or men's
magazine or, for that matter, a huge billboard overlooking Ninth
Avenue?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love nothing more than having a great picture of myself in
an ad,'' admitted Klein.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's so much fun about this?'' he added. ``I just
got a letter from Liz Phair (who's featured in the current fall
campaign), and she's really cool. We're photographing portraits of
these people, and we put on their makeup and clothes. They thank us
for being part of such a really glamorous campaign. They think it's
glamorous to be in our campaign, and I have such respect for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of denim and jeans, I automatically think of
music,'' Klein added, in that both have universal reach.
</P>
<P>
   The jeans ads will run in a host of magazines, including Rolling
Stone, Spin, Vibe, Alternative Press, Teen People, Seventeen, YM,
InStyle, Interview, Time Out and Paper.
</P>
<P>
   In January, five different ads will appear on the back cover of
Rolling Stone, which will be shrink-wrapped with the musicians'
respective CDs for newsstand sales.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ads will break in February magazines, and the images
will also appear on walls _ a new one will go up on 14th Street and
Ninth Avenue on Jan. 15 _ and Max Racks postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a tie-in begun this fall, the musicians will also
appear on the CKJ Network, which is part of MTV.com. Each of the
artists decided which songs they wanted to put on the Web site,
which can be downloaded, and browsers can also find information
about the members of the ad campaign. The new series goes up Jan.
15.
</P>
<P>
   While musicians are the driving force in the CK Jeans campaign,
actors are the focus in the CK Calvin Klein sportswear ads.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the CK campaign are Chris Klein, who appears in
``American Pie''; Elodie Bouchez, featured in ``La Vie
Revedesanges,'' for which she won the Best Actress award at the
Cannes Film Festival; Jimmy Fallon, who appears on ``Saturday Night
Live,'' and Vanessa Shaw, who was in ``Eyes Wide Shut'' and will
appear with Sean Penn in the upcoming film ``Los Angeles Without a
Map.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the actors are photographed against a graphic backdrop
that resembles a burning city.
</P>
<P>
   ``And people say I don't like colors,'' said Klein, when a
visitor took note of an apocalyptic firestorm image in several of
the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Klein said he went with actors who aren't major stars
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more interesting to discuss. This is an American
thing. We always want something new and fresh, the next new thing.
Especially in the fashion business. The other side of that is when
you choose someone who's so well known, it shows no creative
thought at all. To use Gwyneth Paltrow in advertising right now,
you don't have to be a genius. You just have to spend millions of
dollars. If you wanted to use her before she became a star, it's
much more interesting,'' said Klein, an obvious reference to his
idea to feature Paltrow several seasons ago before she was a major
star. The timing for Calvin didn't work out then, but this holiday,
Paltrow appears in the Christian Dior handbag campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As for Calvin Klein Collection, Klein chose Collette, the
Russian model who opened and closed his spring runway show. Klein
considered using her as the Collection model for the fall campaign,
but he was afraid she was too thin and he'd get too much flak.
Well, she's still thin, but Klein insists she's put on weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little concerned about the weight. She's gained
weight. She's a very healthy young woman,'' said Klein.
</P>
<P>
   The men's campaign has Justin Chambers, who appeared previously
in Contradiction for Men, Men's Collection and jeans ads.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the Calvin Klein Underwear business, which, as
reported, added J.C. Penney to its list of clients, Klein refused
to talk about it and deferred all questions to Linda J. Wachner,
who owns the Calvin Klein Underwear business. The ads are sexy and
steamy, though, and once again star Christy Turlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those photographs are really sexier than in the past,'' said
Klein. ``They're in a place where there's not a lot of furniture,
and there's a sense of them being in their place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Underwear ads were shot by Mario Testino and focus on
Klein's women's foundation business. The male ads, which feature
Michael Walton, highlight the new microfiber briefs and trunks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women's underwear ads show images of Turlington lying
on a shag carpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's gotten much more confident and not as afraid,'' said
Klein. ``She was always very controlled and gorgeous. She's growing
up and a woman now. She's a real sexy woman now.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Calvin Klein has another musical production on his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, once again, there will be hardly a super in sight _
with the exception of Christy Turlington for underwear. The CK
Calvin Klein Jeans campaign, shot again by Steven Klein, features
cutting-edge musicians who are not household names yet, but are
making waves in the music scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Calvin Klein Jeans ads are still edgy, contemporary and
not mass,'' said Calvin Klein, in a recent interview at his office.
The ads are built around Klein's new ``Dirty Denim'' collection,
which hits stores this month.
</P>
<P>
   While Klein declined to discuss his spring print budget for CK
Jeans, CK Collection, Calvin Klein Collection and Accessories and
Underwear, he said the print buy is even with last year, but he'll
spend slightly more overall with additional outdoor, postcards and
online banner ads.
</P>
<P>
   Among the musicians featured in the jeans campaign are Joshua
Todd of Buck Cherry, a punk and hard rock blues band; Lisa (Left
Eye) Lopez of TLC, who is coming out with her own solo album; Macy
Gray, a rhythm and blues and soul artist; David Silveria of Korn, a
hard-core rock band; and Tim Wheeler and Charlotte Hatherley of
Ash, a U.K. group.
</P>
<P>
   There's also Moby, a techno artist; Shakira, a Latin-American
pop-rock singer and songwriter; Delores O'Riordan of the
Cranberries; D.J. Rap, a U.K. deejay; and Ja Rule, a hard-core
rapper who plays the lead in Madonna's upcoming movie, ``Ghetto
Superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads were shot in a New York studio, using a variety of
striking backgrounds, ranging from colorful sunsets and mountains
to bolts of lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said that while fashion designers may have their own brand
of hang-ups and attitudes about who they're grouped with in certain
situations, musicians are even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have tremendous attitudes about who's cool and who's
not,'' said Klein, adding that many wanted to know who else was in
the campaign before they agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very aware of who else is doing this campaign,'' said
Klein. The designer said he wanted to limit the campaign to people
``who are critically well accepted, but are just not that well
known.''

budding musical careers?

   ``If it does, great. I think people are doing it to be a part of
it. They think it's fun and cool. And we think they're so cool and
talented.''
</P>
<P>

AMBASSADOR UNDER FIRE IN STATE DEPARTMENT REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They called themselves Friends of Bill, the cadre
of people around the country who had met Bill Clinton, liked Bill
Clinton, and proudly wore big ``FOB'' buttons announcing their
loyalty during Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years into Clinton's presidency, the FOBs have gotten
their reward, and many now call themselves ambassadors to European
and Caribbean posts.
</P>
<P>
   Of 170 current ambassadors, 61 are political appointees, the
largestpercentage in recent history. Not since the tenure of Ronald
Reagan has the percentage of political appointees _ 36 percent _
been so high. Nor does the Clinton count include political
appointees to sunny posts such as Bermuda, where the United States
has a representative _ in this case, former New Hampshire
Democratic fund-raiser Robert Farmer _ but no ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   While even career foreign service officers admit that certain
political appointees serve with distinction, many worry about the
damage that can be done when the chief United States representative
to a foreign nation is not a practiced diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   In a blistering internal State Department report, James C.
Rosapepe, the US ambassador to Romania and a Clinton supporter, is
accused of failing to inform Washington of key developments in
Romania, giving too much weight to the domestic Romanian agenda,
and pressuring US agencies and contractors to hire people he
selects.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important functions of a US embassy is to keep
the State Department posted on a country's internal politics and
trends. But Rosapepe's reporting is so inadequate and ``slanted''
that ``we really have no idea what is going on there,'' said an
official quoted in the report, prepared by the department's
inspector general and obtained by the Globe last week.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials have been forced to rely on their
personal Romanian contacts to find out what is really happening in
the politically and economically volatile nation. ``Those who need
to keep up on Romanian events have developed their own sources, and
the embassy is not first among them,'' said the inspector general's
report.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Romania, Rosapepe, a former Democratic state legislator
from Maryland, has displayed a lack of diplomatic discretion, the
report indicates. The ambassador includes Romanian nationals in
many embassy meetings, has discussed US budget figures with
potential contractors, and sometimes brings only a Romanian embassy
employee and not a US Foreign Service officer to high-level
meetings with the Romanian government, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Rosapepe, reached in Bucharest, said it would be improper for
him to discuss the report. But allies of Rosapepe's in the
diplomatic corps defended Rosapepe's general performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done a great job . . . in a difficult situation,'' said
Richard Schifter, special assistant to the secretary of state for
Southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find him to be energetic, innovative, flexible and highly
respected by the folks he deals with in Romania,'' Richard Sklar,
US special representative for the Southeast European Initiative,
said by telephone from Rome. But, Sklar added, ``I know nothing
about the report and it is none of my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosapepe is hardly the first US ambassador to be criticized. But
the fact that he is a political appointee makes his case
noteworthy, as critics complain that Clinton has been overly
generous in handing out plum ambassadorships to friends and
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as this administration has used the Lincoln Bedroom as a
little prize for funders, it has given out ambassadorships in the
same manner,'' said Larry Birns, head of the Council on Hemispheric
Affairs, a liberal foreign policy group.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials defended the practice of making
political appointments. ``I really believe that for key jobs in
dealing with important governments, you want someone who has had
experience outside government,'' Schifter said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, political appointments are made to posts that are
pleasant places to live, such as Western Europe and the Caribbean.
Currently, every European ambassadorship except two is held by a
political appointee; posts in difficult or dangerous places, such
as the Balkans and most of Africa, are almost universally held by
career diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   New Englanders who have received ambassadorships based on their
relationship to the Clinton administration include Jean Kennedy
Smith, former ambassador to Ireland; New Hampshire Democrat George
Bruno, formerly ambassador to Belize; and former Boston mayor
Raymond F. Flynn, who was ambassador to the Holy See. Current
ambassadors from the region include former US representative
Richard Swett of New Hampshire, now ambassador to Denmark; Boston
civil rights activist Charles Richard Stith, ambassador to
Tanzania; and New Hampshire lawyer Edward E. Shumaker III,
ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago.
</P>
<P>
   Saving the cushier posts for friends and supporters of the
president ``has a long-term effect on morale'' in the foreign
service, said Marshall Adair, president of the American Foreign
Service Association, which represents career employees. ``It's hard
to build and maintain an effective professional diplomatic service
if people don't believe they have a chance of getting the top
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has politicized the process as well. The chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, Republican of
North Carolina, has held up numerous Clinton appointments, often
because of an unrelated foreign policy disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress needs to impose some discipline on itself . . . and
the administration has to exercise some control in giving out
assignments as a way of paying back good contributors,'' Adair
said.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official who asked not to be named said that
it was ridiculous to try to set an arbitrary limit on political
appointees ``because it all comes down to the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosapepe's assignment was unusual in that Romania is considered
neither a comfortable posting nor a stable nation. Just last week,
the Romanian government slipped into crisis when the president
fired the prime minister, who then refused to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts describe Romania as a nation on the brink of
prosperity, which may eventually join such exclusive clubs as NATO
and the European Union, but also in danger of falling into the
economic morass and political upheaval of other post-communist
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Romania has lagged in the region in economic reform, and suffers
from the brutal legacy left by former dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu,
whom the Romanians executed on Christmas day 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romania has wonderful potential, but it is an unfortunate
position right now,'' said George Handy, an Eastern European
specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain diplomatic posts that you just don't hand
out to cronies or fiscal sluices, and Bucharest is one of them,''
Birns said.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the political appointments say the non-career
ambassadors often bring solid managerial skills to the job, and
that their posts benefit from the ambassador's personal
relationship to the White House. In some cases, such as the United
Kingdom, the selection of the US ambassador is less crucial because
Clinton speaks directly to British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of unliked political appointments are legendary. One
ambassador to Sri Lanka during the Eisenhower administration was
unable to name the prime minister of Sri Lanka during a
congressional hearing, recalled a former career diplomat. An
ambassador to Jamaica once assigned each embassy employee an
animal, and communicated with his staff by stamping an image of the
animal _ for example, a drawing of a chicken _ onto correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some outstanding (non-career) ambassadors,'' said
the former career ambassador. But there are some exceptions, and
``it's up to the system to find the counter-balance.''

SCIENTISTS PUSH GENETIC ENGINEERING TO NEW LEVELS
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color photos of biologist with a test tube, and a
petunia)
 By RON MATUS 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By transferring a gene from a common weed into a petunia,
biologist David Clark can make the flower's bloom last a couple of
weeks longer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't care to make them plastic,'' says Clark, 33, a
molecular biologist and horticulturist at the University of Florida
in Gainesville. ''We just want them to last so the growers can
expand their market and the consumers can enjoy them longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving genes from one species to another used to be science
fiction. Now it's routine, as scientists push genetic engineering
to new levels.
</P>
<P>
   Transgenics is big stuff, on a par with the emergence of the
Internet and the last ''green revolution'' in agriculture in the
1950s and 1960s. Supporters are counting on high-tech horticulture
to develop crops that will feed a hungry planet.
</P>
<P>
   Making pretty flowers bloom longer, Clark says, is just the
''icing on the cake'' of agricultural achievement. Transgenic
research already has created sweeter fruits and vegetables, higher
yielding crops and pest- and disease-resistant plants.
</P>
<P>
   But critics warn of ''Frankenfoods'' and ''superweeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental activist Jeremy Rifkin claims scientists are
''reseeding the planet with a second Genesis.'' Protesters in
Europe have ripped up transgenic crops in the field and sent
tremors of a trade war back across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   For universities who are major players in transgenic research,
such as the University of California at Berkeley, the University of
California at Davis, and the University of Florida, it makes for a
daunting public relations challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a Jurassic Park mentality out there,'' says Mike
Martin, UF's vice president for agriculture and natural resources.
''We have to educate the public and then proceed carefully. If we
don't do it, it will be done elsewhere _ and not as well.''
 &UR; PICK A TRAIT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Genes _ which are made up of DNA _ are the blueprints for life.
And considering how fast, how often and how far they're being moved
around in labs now, the reference to Jurassic Park may be apt.
</P>
<P>
   No longer are scientists limited to finding the traits they want
in individual members of certain species _ say, sweetness in
tomatoes _ and then slowly breeding those traits into others so
they become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers can take the desired traits from one species and
engineer them into the species they want to ''improve.''
Furthermore, genes can be drawn from any species and implanted into
any other: Bacteria. Viruses. Plants. Animals. People. There are
millions of combinations from which to choose.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound futuristic, but man has been altering genes in
plants through traditional breeding and selection for centuries,
said Karen Marshall, a spokeswoman with the St. Louis-based
Monsanto, a company that makes nutritional, pharmaceutical and
agricultural products. ''Corn would be a cereal grass with a little
nub on the end of it without man,'' Marshall says.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto has developed dozens of new crop varieties either by
itself or in conjunction with university researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't call it a revolution. I call it evolution,'' Marshall
said. ''You pick the trait you want. You insert it. We may do
10,000 plants before we find the one that's perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are working with genes in animal species, too,
mapping them, cloning them, transferring them. But it's with plants
that scientists have most quickly taken the new tools and put them
to widespread use.
</P>
<P>
   A CHANGED LANDSCAPE
</P>
<P>
   This advanced technology has altered a lot of landscape,
physically and culturally, in a short time. Monsanto made the first
transgenic plant, a petunia with a marker gene from a bacteria, in
1983. The first transgenic crop to be sold commercially, a
slow-ripening tomato, hit grocery stores in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In three years, the number of acres of transgenic crops planted
in the United States has gone from zero to tens of millions.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are using biotechnology to make rice with extra iron
and beta carotene. They've engineered potatoes with bits of virus
gene to fight diarrhea in Third World countries. They've even found
a novel use for tobacco: Fitting it with a bacteria gene so it can
break down explosive chemical residues left in soil _ a consequence
of TNT production.
</P>
<P>
   Corn, soybeans, cotton, potatoes and other crops have all been
engineered with a bacterial gene that contains a natural pesticide.
Insects that munch on the pesticide-infused plant die.
</P>
<P>
   Other crops have been ''wired'' with herbicide-resistant genes
from bacteria. Farmers can more efficiently apply weedkiller
without fear of killing the crop.
 &UR; A SECOND GENESIS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in Europe, a lot of people don't want potatoes engineered to
kill the bugs that eat them.
</P>
<P>
   And they don't want frostproof oranges, rot-resistant melons or
anything else researchers might be working on, either.
</P>
<P>
   Great Britain's Prince Charles is one of them. The prince, a
longtime organic farmer, is an opposition leader in England.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are we going to allow the industrialisation of life itself,
redesigning the natural world for the sake of convenience?'' he has
written on his Web site. ''Or should we be adopting a gentler, more
considered approach, seeking always to work with the grain of
nature?''
</P>
<P>
   Activists in Europe have made up their minds. They've defined
the debate with a catch-phrase: ''Frankenfoods.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, so far there hasn't been much of an
outcry. Biotech supporters say it's proof that the public is happy
with the new foods. Opponents say it's proof the public is
clueless.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to look at the scale of what is happening,'' writes
activist Rifkin, a longtime critic of the biotech industry. ''In
the next 10 years, the major companies hope to introduce thousands
of gene-spliced organisms over millions of acres of land and even
into the water. They will reseed the planet with a second
genesis.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not just the next step in plant breeding, Rifkin says _
it is a heart-stopping leap. One that has already resulted in
unexpected outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, scientists announced that pollen from
genetically engineered corn can kill Monarch butterfly caterpillars
that eat it. The corn produces a natural pesticide designed to kill
a major corn pest, the European corn borer.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say that a handful of big agribusinesses, such as
Monsanto, are making huge profits through rapid development of
transgenic species. The faster a company can get a new crop variety
to market, the faster it can cash in. Safety checks, they fear, are
bypassed in the race for money.
</P>
<P>
   Even university research teams in biotech fields are viewed with
a suspicious eye, since they rely more and more on private, and
often corporate, research dollars.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FORGING A BETTER WORLD &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Researchers agree that there are potential pitfalls and ethical
questions to be confronted. Some also agree with critics who demand
labeling of transgenic products.
</P>
<P>
   But, they counter, there is potential for so much good: By
moving genes, researchers have made corn with bigger kernels and
wheat that grows 30 percent bigger. They're on the hunt for
virus-resistant oranges and grapefruit that aren't bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important crops will emerge, such as
''nutriceuticals'' and ''farmaceuticals'' _ produce with
disease-fighting antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought this was cool, this was something I had to do,''
said University of Florida Professor Harry Klee, 46, who began
working on transgenic plants after earning his doctoral degree in
biochemistry in 1980. ''Without this (technology), the world's
population is going to exceed its capacity to make food.''
</P>
<P>
   Klee was a researcher for Monsanto before coming to the
University of Florida, where he and his assistants are working on
everything from more productive cotton plants to melons that stay
ripe longer.
</P>
<P>
   All that work doesn't come cheap. It's not unusual for
university researchers such as Klee to corral several hundred
thousand dollars worth of grants each year. Klee says about half of
his money comes from the federal government, half from agricultural
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Klee hopes a new, sweeter variety of tomato he has developed
with the help of a corn gene will give tomato farmers an edge to
win back markets they lost because of the 1994 North American Free
Trade Agreement. But even after research and development, getting
transgenic fruits and vegetables to market is a costly endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   It cost Monsanto $2 million to maneuver an engineered tomato
through stiff regulatory hurdles designed to protect consumers and
the environment. ''We had to show that in every way, shape or form
that this was a tomato,'' Klee said.
</P>
<P>
   As money from government sources gets tighter, university
researchers look to industry to pick up the slack.And with so many
crops, so many potential transformations and so many genes to
choose from, industry researchers alone can't keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ''For every success story,'' said University of Florida
professor Curt Hannah, who has developed new varieties of corn,
''there's a thousand things that didn't work.''

<P>
   Singer acknowledges that life has become harder for some, but
says he believes that the free market provides the best standard of
living for the most. Last year, Singer had 15 people working for
him. Today he has seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to shed people,'' he said. ``I'm not here to keep people
employed. I'm here to make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Such cold, bottom-line thinking is unfathomable to Vrtic. For 17
years, he worked at the Poldi steel mill, as did about half of the
adults in Kladno, a town of 75,000. Ten years ago, some 22,000
people worked at Poldi. But after it was privatized, the staff
shrank to 6,000. Two years ago, the plant closed.
</P>
<P>
   Communist poets used to wax lyrical about the red haze that hung
over Kladno, a product of Poldi's furnaces. But economists say it
had to be shut down because it operated in the red.
</P>
<P>
   Vrtic says he believes Poldi was closed for political reasons.
He says its workers were punished for being supporters of the
communist system. He and other steel workers say they did not have
skills that could be transferred to other emerging industries, and
that the government has not retrained them.
</P>
<P>
   Vrtic and other laid-off workers, such as Jiri Nohejl, 55, say
that they have been turned away when looking for work in Prague by
people who sneer at ``Red Kladno.''
</P>
<P>
   The steel mill did more than provide jobs. It paid for nearly
all of the social activities in town, including the youth hockey
program that produced Jaromir Jagr, the Pittsburgh Penguins star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poldi was the lifeblood of the community,'' said Vaclav Kalla,
49, chairman of the district council. ``Poldi organized vacations
for workers and their families, meals for the elderly. It was like
a big brother, overseeing everything in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Vrtic, who has two sons, has scraped by with odd jobs, most
recently as one of the 100 security guards who patrol the idle
steel mill. He makes about 60 percent of what he used to make.
</P>
<P>
   Vrtic has continued to vote for communists, and recent polls
show that more than 20 percent of Czechs would vote for communists,
making them nearly as popular as the governing, coalition-leading
Civic Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Poldi mill closed during its 100th anniversary. A huge
bronze statue near the factory gates that pays homage to the
worker, the backbone of the communist state, is overgrown with
brush now.
</P>
<P>
   Vrtic carries in his wallet one of the razor blades made at
Poldi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of our tradition,'' he said. ``But memories won't
help.''

   The rise of nationalism
</P>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ Shortly after NATO troops had sent Yugoslav
troops packing, Ilir Demiri, 19, infiltrated a press conference
here and listened as British Lieutenant General Michael Jackson,
who led the liberation forces, asked ethnic Albanians not to
retaliate against the Serb minority left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Demiri, an ethnic Albanian who said several of his family had
been killed by Serb forces, snickered as he listened to what he
considered Jackson's naive plea for tolerance, one repeated by
President Clinton last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not understand this place,'' Demiri said. ``This is
our country. The Serbs do not belong here.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last seven months, Kosovars who think like Demiri have
taken their vengeance against Serbs and gypsies who are seen as
collaborators in Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's attempt to
ethnically cleanse a part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Under communism, overt nationalism was suppressed. Now it is
emerging, often expressing itself as xenophobia and sometimes as
violent racism directed at anyone not perceived as being native.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and Yugoslavia provide a case study of post-communist
nationalism. Under Josip Broz Tito, Yugoslavia's communist leader
from 1945 until his death in 1980, a more pragmatic form of
communism gave people a higher standard of living than those in the
Soviet bloc. Tito's federal political system was aimed at keeping
the nationalism of the region's various ethnic groups in check.
</P>
<P>
   Once a fervent communist, Milosevic reinvented himself as a Serb
nationalist when communism collapsed. The ethnic quilt that Tito
held together tore apart, as nationalism fed wars and led to the
founding of independent countries in Slovenia, Macedonia, Croatia,
and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   While Yugoslavia is the most obvious example, extreme
nationalism, from the neo-Nazis in the depressed corners of the
former East Germany to the skinheads in Slovakia who beat up
foreigners, has become a problem in virtually all parts of Central
and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Velvet Divorce'' of the Czech Republic and Slovakia is
held up as an example of cooler heads prevailing in the face of
polarizing nationalism. But each country has its own troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic immunity is supposed to protect foreign officials
from the vagaries of laws in countries where they are not
nationals. But the skinheads who stalk the streets of Bratislava,
Slovakia's capital, have created their own menacing concept:
diplomatic vulnerabilty. Being a foreign diplomat, or a foreign
anything, increases the chances of getting attacked. Last summer, a
Chinese diplomat was badly beaten by a gang. A few weeks later,
Libyan diplomats complained that their sons had been attacked by
skinheads.
</P>
<P>
   John Sanchez Bendezu, a 26-year-old graduate student from Peru,
decided he had seen enough. When he saw three skinheads close in on
a Korean student, he intervened. The skinheads turned on Bendezu,
beating him severely. When police arrived, they were more
interested in demanding the identity cards of the foreigners than
finding the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Bendezu got off lightly. Last year, in Prague, skinheads were
chasing a Gypsy when they stumbled across a Sudanese student. The
skinheads abandoned their intended quarry and settled for the black
youth, stabbing him to death. The murder was shocking, even more so
because it took place in a city that is considered the most
enlightened capital in Eastern Europe, the home of writers like
Vaclav Havel, now the Czech president, who inspired the Velvet
Revolution 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Few have suffered more than the Roma, or Gypsies, an estimated 8
million of whom live in Eastern and Central Europe. Gypsies had
jobs in the Soviet bloc, and they say the suppression of
nationalism by the communist regime kept racists at bay. Now,
Gypsies are routinely beaten, and sometimes murdered, by racists
even in the countries considered most progressive.
</P>
<P>
   Josef Facuna, a Gypsy leader in Ostrava in the Czech Republic,
said he and other Gypsies prefer the certainties and safety of
communism to the supposed freedom under democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least during the totalitarian regime, I knew that I would
work eight hours, come home, and go wherever I wanted. But not
now,'' he said. ``Now I'm afraid that someone will beat me up.''

   Confronting the past
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN _ As the 10th anniversary of the collapse of the Berlin
Wall approached, the thirst for nostalgia was insatiable, and
Guenter Schabowksi relived his 15 minutes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   It was Schabowski who, as chief spokesman for East Germany's
Politburo, garbled the regime's plan to save itself by loosening
travel restrictions. As almost an afterthought, and because he had
not read a briefing paper thoroughly, Schabowski announced on live
television on the night of Nov. 9, 1989, that the border was open.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds gathered at the wall in East Berlin and, after meeting
muted resistance from guards who had not been given any
instructions, began streaming into West Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin Wall had collapsed, Germany was free, and Schabowski
was its unwitting liberator.
</P>
<P>
   Schabowski's almost comic role in the collapse of the wall, and
the subsequent collapse of the Soviet bloc, was recalled here so
often and with such fondness that it came as a shock to many that
on Nov. 8, just as the limousines carrying former President George
Bush and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev rolled into Berlin
for the 10th anniversary gala, Schabowski was ordered to serve
three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Schabowski and two other Politburo members, including Egon
Krenz, the last communist leader of East Germany, were convicted of
manslaughter for giving the orders to border guards who shot and
killed more than 900 people who tried to escape over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, who was hailed as a hero and made a citizen of
Berlin, criticized the decision to imprison Schabowski and the
others as ``victor's justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should put this all behind us,'' said Gorbachev. ``We
should look to the future instead of holding witch hunts.''
</P>
<P>
   For Falco Werkentin, however, and many of the 250,000 people who
were political prisoners of the Stasi, the East German secret
police, this is not about vengeance but justice. Werkentin, now the
deputy in charge of Stasi files in Berlin, says too few of those
who used violence and repression to prop up the regime have been
imprisoned, because too many people, especially West German judges,
want to forget the past and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the heroes of the fall of 1989, there was no place in the
judicial analysis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Romania, those who brought on the counterrevolution a decade
ago wasted little time in apportioning blame. They put the
communist dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu and his wife up against a wall
and shot them.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the rest of the former communist bloc, it is only
now that the ghosts of the past are being confronted, that those
who used the repression needed to maintain a totalitarian society
are being held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   In Hungary, four men accused of opening fire on demonstrators
during the failed uprising of 1956 are on trial for murder in a
case that has opened old wounds. In Warsaw, the Polish supreme
court last month ordered the trial of the former communist leader
General Wojciech Jaruzelski and nine other communist officials
accused of ordering police to shoot workers who rioted in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries prefer to let the past lie. Czech President
Havel, who has hosted a series of conferences aimed at remembering
the communist era and learning from it, says his country has failed
to confront its past. His desire for a truth and reconciliation
commission is not shared by many of his fellow Czechs. Havel
complains that communism spread responsibility so widely that it is
difficult to fix blame, and so, many would prefer not to try.
</P>
<P>
   Confronting the past does not mean simply holding the former
regime accountable. In Poland, dozens of people who were raised as
Roman Catholics have over the past decade learned they were born
Jewish, part of an identity switch meant to save them from the
Holocaust.

WHY ARE SUNSET TIMES DIFFERENT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. At 9 p.m. in Portland, Ore., it was very light. A day later
in San Francisco at 9 p.m. it was dusk. Why are sunset times
different?
</P>
<P>
   D.R. Stoneham, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The answer lies in your longitude and latitude. Though the
earth isn't a perfect circle, it's divided up that way for
navigational and time setting purposes. Longitude runs vertically,
up and down between the poles. Latitude is horizontal, like the
equator. It may help to remember that latitude, which runs across,
has an ``A'' in it.
</P>
<P>
   Both measurements are carved up in degrees (360 of them in a
circle), minutes (60 per degree) and seconds (60 per minute).
</P>
<P>
   Time zones are 15 degrees across, since the 360 degree circle of
the earth, divided by 24 hours, equals 15 degrees of longitude per
hour. So at Boston's latitude, 42.4 degrees North (above the
equator, which is designated 0 latitude), one degree is 49 miles
across and the time zones are 735 miles wide.
</P>
<P>
   But where you are in the time zone, not the clock, determines
the actual time the sun sets. Since Portland is east of San
Francisco by 13 minutes of longitude. Same time, different sky.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just a question of east-west longitude. Portland is
also eight degrees, one minute latitude north of San Francisco. The
earth's axis tilts over the course of the year, with the north pole
tilting toward the sun in the summer, away from it in the winter.
The moment when it stops tilting one way and starts tilting back is
the Winter Solstice, Latin for ``suns stands still'' This year it
occurs at 2:44 a.m. December 22nd in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter, the further north you are, the lower the sun is
on the horizon to the south during the day, and the later it rises
and the earlier it sets. So differences in latitude also affect how
dark or light it is at different places in the same time zone.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At eight months, Sherri Epstein's daughter Rachel was falling
behind the normal milestones of development. She couldn't hold her
large head up or roll over; she didn't even babble normally.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis was months in coming: it turned out that Rachel
has a rare and devastating genetic disorder called Canavan disease
that ravages the brain and nervous system and usually leads to
death in the first few years of life.
</P>
<P>
   The disease affects about 1 in 6,500 births to couples of
Ashkenazi Jewish background, like the Epsteins. If both parents
carry the Canavan gene, there is a 25 percent chance a child they
produce will have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A recently developed gene test could have identified Epstein and
her husband Ken as healthy carriers of the gene: it also could have
been used for prenatal diagnoses. But only in 1998, after Epstein
was pregnant, did a professional organization advise doctors they
should offer the Canavan test to high-risk couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never want another parent to feel the way we feel,'' says
Epstein, who, along with other Canavan famlies, are spreading the
word about the disease and the existence of the test.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canavan test and several others, as well as those yet to
be developed, are at the center of an intense and growing dispute
over who should control and profit from them.
</P>
<P>
   The basic issue is whether a 1980 Supreme Court decision
allowing patents on living organisms is unfairly enabling private
companies to monopolize specific gene tests, barring other labs
from performing them or charging what critics say are excessive
royalty payments.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel, now 14 months old, has the typical signs of the disease:
poor muscle tone makes her ``floppy;'' she can't sit up on her own,
stand, or walk, and so far she has no speech. ``She's like a
Raggedy Ann doll, right down to the curly red hair,'' says Epstein,
who lives in Worcester, Mass. Due to a gene mutation, toxic
substances build up in the brain in Canavan infants, causing
disability and retardation, blindness, seizures and, for many, an
early death.
</P>
<P>
   There is no treatment; however, scientists are testing gene
therapy in some Canavan children, and Epstein hopes that Rachel can
be included when the privately funded experiment resumes next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The gene test ``is an absolute must'' to prevent the devastating
disease, says Dr. Debby Duitsch, a Newton, Mass. physician and
parent of a Canavan child.
</P>
<P>
   However, the rights to perform the Canavan test are in the hands
of Miami Children's Hospital, which received a patent on the test,
developed there in 1997. Canavan families and a number of medical
geneticists are unhappy with the hospital's plans for
commercializing the test through limited licensing and charging a
$12.50 royalty fee on every test.
</P>
<P>
   The patent gives the hospital the right to license the test to
other institutions at a charge; the patent doesn't expire for 17
years, which means that other hospitals or labs either negotiate a
license with Miami Children's or they can't offer the test.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over gene patents comes at a time when the federally
run Human Genome Project and competitors in the private sector are
rushing to finish decoding the entire set of human genes _ the
roughly 100,000 pieces of DNA that dramatically influence health
and disease.
</P>
<P>
   A number of labs funded by the government are putting the DNA
code into a public database as quickly as it's deciphered. But the
chief competitor in the private sector, Celera Genomics Inc. of
Rockville, Md., is withholding its gene discoveries until it can
file patent applications on information it believes will be
commercially valuable in developing a wide array of new gene-based
tests and treatments. In October, Celera announced that it had
filed patent applications on 6,500 genes or partial genes.
</P>
<P>
   The Committee for Responsible Genetics of Cambridge, Mass. is
leading a campaign to get Congress to reverse the policy on
patenting life forms, which, they say, are ``part of the natural
world into which we are all born.'' And organizations like the
American College of Medical Genetics, whose members do much of the
testing and treating of patients with genetic diseases, are going
on record opposing the gene patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique situation where physicians (genetic
laboratory directors) are being stopped from practicing medicine''
by the restrictive licensing of patents, contends Jon Mertz, a
bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The view from the biotech industry, however, is that what is
being patented ``is not the DNA inside someone that's walking
around,'' but a process or product based on that DNA, says Ivor
Elfiri of the law firm Boston Mintz, Levin. Antibiotics, he points
out, come from natural organisms, too, but are not patented.
</P>
<P>
   From the viewpoint of the medical genetics field, however, the
stampede to patent genes neglects the fact that the public paid for
much of the original gene research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see society benefit from its investment in the
human genome project,'' said Dr. Arthur Beaudet, a medical
geneticist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if royalties are preventing people from benefiting (by
reducing access to the fruits of gene research), then I think
Congress ought to take a look'' at possibly changing the law.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Miami Children's has begun enforcing its
patent. It has restricted the use of the test to about a dozen labs
with which it is negotiating licenses, and placing a cap on the
number of tests a lab can do. In addition, the hospital is charging
the $12.50 royalty on every test carried out. The licensed lab has
to pay the fee out of its own pocket or pass on the cost to
patients. The test costs consumers or their insurers anywhere from
$60 to $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``If every gene test carries an additional royalty cost of $10
or $15 we're going to be in terrible trouble,'' said Judith Tsipis,
who heads the genetic counseling program at Brandeis University and
who had a son die from Canavan. Gene tests are proliferating
quickly and in the future, she said, large numbers of people may be
tested for hundreds of mutations, which means an additional $10 per
test could add up to thousands of dollars. ``We are extremely
concerned that patents will be restrictive and costly and will
limit access to testing,'' said Dr. Rodney Howell, president of the
American College of Medical Genetics, speaking at a meeting earlier
this month of the New England Regional Genetics Group in Durham,
N.H.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only worries about access that disturb the opponents of
gene patents: it's the fundamental concept. ``I think the idea of
patenting a gene is absolutely outrageous _ how can someone claim
it as belonging to them?'' said Duitsch, the Newton physician and
parent of a Canavan child. ``It seems to me you're talking about
people's lives here.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease, which was first identified in the 1930s, is also
known as ``spongy degeneration of the brain.'' But not until the
1990s was the mutant gene discovered at Miami Children's, and only
in 1998 did the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology
advise its members that it should be offered routinely when both
members of a couple were of Ashkenazi ethnicity. Unfortunately, the
advisory came too late for the Epsteins.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the patent issue is clouding the test and a number of other
gene tests for neurological and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canavan is just falling in line with a lot of other tests that
we've been stopped from doing,'' said Dr. Debra Leonard, director
of the molecular pathology laboratory at the University of
Pennsylvania. In some cases, the royalty fees are excessive, she
says, robbing laboratories of their incentive to offer the test,
and in other cases the patent holder has exclusively licensed a
single lab to do the test.
</P>
<P>
   Other tests that patent-holders have monopolized, she says,
include ones for a mutant gene that confers an elevated risk for
Alzheimer's disease; at least two genes for neurodegenerative
diseases, and BRCA1 and BRCA2, inherited breast cancer genes.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard and others in the field say that excluding all but a one
or a few laboratories from doing a test is anticompetitive, often
leads to poorer service _ more errors, slower turnaround time _ and
prevents other lab specialists from improving the tests and making
them cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, hospital officials say they want to recoup part of
the $5 million they says they spent in developing the test. That
is, after all, one of the reasons inventors are awarded patents.
</P>
<P>
   The other goal, by licensing only a few test providers, is to
funnel the relatively small number of Canavan tests done each year
to a few selected hospitals, including one dominant commercial lab
that would become a ``market leader.'' Such a lab, says the
hospital, which has not yet selected a candidate, would be required
to maintain high standards and to underwrite an effort to spread
the word about Canavan disease and the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to limit testing, we want to expand it,'' says
Marc Golden, president of Golden Group Intellectual Capital LLC of
New York, who is the hospital's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far the hospital has declined to drop or lower the royalty
fee or change its licensing practices, but has agreed to discuss
these issues with Canavan advocates on Jan. 20.
</P>

A SPIRITUALITY INSPIRED BY EASE AND ESTEEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   God may have had the first word, but he sure isn't having the
last one. As we round the corner into the 21st century, Americans
have shrugged loose the strictures of Scripture and are busy
remaking the religious rules _ and even the nature of faith itself
_ to their own liking.
</P>
<P>
   We have discarded both the devil and details of religion,
consigning the Holy Spirit to symbolic status, insisting that
heaven isn't just for believers anymore, and dismissing the
once-powerful concept of hell as all but irrelevant. Traditional
worship in church or synagogue must now vie with a variety of
alternatives, from home services to mega-churches, from
cyber-services to new age fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a time of spiritual exploration that makes us
question, and in some cases be uncomfortable with, traditional ways
of doing church or religion,'' says David Roozen, director of the
Hartford Institute for Religion Research at the Hartford Seminary,
an interfaith institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of free-floating religion and a lot of
experimentation going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for traditionalists, there is some good news: Basic faith
is strong, though doubt creeps upward.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, when the University of Chicago's National Opinion
Research Center polled Americans about their beliefs, 63 percent
said they had no doubt that God existed. A decade later the
response was the same.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of disbelievers _ although still small _ had
doubled, from 1 percent to 3, while the number who said they
believed in a higher power, but not a personal God, increased from
7 percent to 10. Other categories also show encroaching doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at all the categories, you could say there is an
increase in disbelief,'' said Tom W. Smith, director of the study,
which is called the General Social Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what those and other, similar surveys show is that a
strong majority of Americans have a basic belief in God and an
afterlife and say religion is important in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But just as plain chant gave way to polyphony, Americans seem to
be playing jazz with traditional teachings _ and the change in tone
is coming more from the pew than the pulpit. The story of how some
of that change was discovered is as interesting as the attitude
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the widespread view was that, despite the
turbulent '60s, the questioning '70s, the materialistic '80s, and
the complacent '90s, Americans remain as churched as ever over the
last half-century.
</P>
<P>
   That, after all, is what a number of Gallup opinion polls have
shown. In 1947, 41 percent of Americans surveyed told the Gallup
poll they attended religious services regularly. These days, 40
percent say they were in a house of worship on the previous Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That statistic has led many to proclaim that God is still in his
heaven, his flock still loyally in his house.
</P>
<P>
   But when a trio of skeptics employed a number of sociological
research methods to double-check those self-reported contentions,
they discovered that a goodly part of that worship was imaginary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that about half the people who said they were there
actually attended services on a given weekend,'' said Mark Chaves,
associate professor of sociology at the University of Arizona. ``So
we look a lot less religious than it seems when you use the
standard self-reported survey stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that people regularly lie to pollsters? Chaves is
circumspect. ``I don't like to use the word lying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, he says, they interpret the question as asking if they
think religion is important and they want to answer in a way that
says yes. Or perhaps they intended to go to church.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, of course, it was well known that the road to
hell was paved with good intentions. But at a time when no less an
authority than the pope has said that hell isn't really a pit of
torture and despair of the sort depicted by painter Hieronymus
Bosch, but rather only the absence of God's grace, the penitent in
the pew has taken things much further.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is there neither fire nor brimstone, but the idea of
heaven's gate as a portal narrow as a needle's eye seems to have
gone the way of Joe Camel. These days, heaven is seen more as, say,
a celestial community college: inclusive, receptive to all creeds,
and with all-but-open admissions.
</P>
<P>
   And forget Pascal's famous formulation of belief in God as a
self-interested wager that cost little if you were wrong and won
you an afterlife if you were right. No need to ante up in the new
theology, where many people believe that if there is a heaven,
simply living as a good person will be enough to get you in.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly the only heterodox view that Americans hold when
it comes to religion, says George Barna, president of the Barna
Research Group, a Ventura, Calif., firm that regularly surveys
Americans about their religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Although 58 percent say they believe the Bible is totally
accurate in its teaching, they hold views divergent from what the
good book teaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority say that when it comes to personal salvation, it is
either based on belief in Christ or just being a good person, as
though it is multiple choice,'' says Barna.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 out of 10 Americans say there is no such thing as
the Holy Spirit, though this third member of the trinity is
supposedly fundamental to the Christian faith that 84 percent of
Americans embrace. (Curiously, 55 percent of born-again Christians
don't believe in the existence of the Holy Spirit.) It's perhaps
less surprising that 72 percent say the devil doesn't actually
exist, but rather is only a symbol of evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a basic belief in God or a basic belief in some
sort of higher power, but they take it upon themselves to determine
the nature of those deities,'' Barna said. ``What we have is a
nation where everyone is his own favorite theologian.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way in which loosening of traditional theological
understanding is seen is the giving way of strict religion to
gauzier notions of spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't restrict your definition of religion to what happens
in that big stone building,'' argues historian Mark Silk, director
of the Center for the Study of Religion in Public Life at Trinity
College in Hartford. ``Religion has migrated in some parts of the
country into nontraditionally religious institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Silk cites such activities as tai chi, the Chinese martial arts
movement sometimes called moving meditation, or Falun Gong, the
Chinese spiritual movement with roots in Buddhism and Taoism, and
even ardent environmentalism, as examples of that migration.
</P>
<P>
   From there, of course, it's a short step to religion as little
more than a personal chat with God. Which is the approach that
popular author Neale Donald Walsch has taken in his best-selling
books, ``Conversations with God'' (three volumes) and now,
``Friendship with God: an uncommon dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   As Walsch tells it in this last book, God speaks to him in
friendly conversations, little epiphanies that seem to pop into his
head much like an instant message on a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   He writes: ``I heard God's voice whisper: `Neale, your
relationship with Me is no different from your relationship with
each other. You begin your interaction with each other with a
conversation. If that goes well, you form a friendship. And if that
goes well, you experience a sense of Oneness _ communion _ with the
other person. It is exactly the same way with Me.' '' (God's
italics)
</P>
<P>
   This is not the stern figure of the Old Testament. He is not
even a Dutch uncle-type deity. We're talking a thoroughly
easygoing, ``I'm OK, you're OK,'' type, a God whose standards are
as flexible as our desires, one who believes that ``There are no
cans or cannots here. There are no shoulds or shouldn'ts. You may
do as you wish. Every decision is a statement of Who You Are.''
That, at least, is the gospel according to Walsch.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this sort of new age God is famously easy to get along
with. No need to tremble or quake, nor is self-abnegation or
humility required. He's not ``our father who art in heaven'' so
much as an indulgent friend, always ready to enable us.
</P>
<P>
   One objection to that sort of theology is obvious: It's the
Church of the Wholly Convenient. The theology is too easy, and in
its ease, it appropriates religion into the soothing,
self-therapeutic impulse that so characterizes today's culture.
</P>
<P>
   Is a spiritual Sunday walk on the beach easier than church? Why
not make it a stroll on the golf course and kill two birds with one
stone? God wants you to do what you want.
</P>
<P>
   ``One wonders about the extent to which there is really a depth
in contemporary spirituality,'' says Roozen, of the Hartford
Seminary, who calls it a compartmentalized religion ``of partial
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush may testify to the way his faith has changed his
life _ as he noted anew in last week's GOP debate in Iowa _ but
theological conservatives wonder if America's ever-more-casual
theology truly carries the power of improvement any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries ago, Voltaire said that society needed religion to
keep the servants from stealing the silver. No one would phrase it
quite that way today, but theologians do worry about the loss of a
more demanding moral sense in American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real concern for that moral loss,'' says Eddie
Gibbs, a professor of religion at Fuller Theological Seminary in
Pasadena. ``Where do we base values that have traditionally come
out of religious convictions?''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder fin de siecle faith frustrates the traditionalists,
who feel theology should establish unwavering standards of belief
and conduct, not ones that evolve with the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the Catholic bishops saying they are not sure that
what goes on in Catholic colleges is really Catholicism, you hear
the conservative Christians saying the liberal religions are not
really Christianity, you hear Orthodox Jews saying that Reform Jews
are not really Jewish,'' says Alan Wolfe, director of the Center
for Religion in American Public Life at Boston College. But though
the changes may mortify some, in a country where persuasion is
increasingly the pulpit's only tool, there's little stopping the
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans reinvent everything. We are a very inventive
people,'' says Wolfe. ``And you can't have an old-fashioned
religion in a modern country. The only thing that surprises me is
that people are surprised by this reinvention.''

DRUG THIEVES HIT VETERINARIANS FOR `SPECIAL K' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUDSON, N.H. _ A gunman walked over the stenciled pawprints and
up the front steps of the Lawson Veterinary Hospital one afternoon
last month.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't want money. He wanted an animal anesthetic called
ketamine, or, as it's known on the street, ``Special K.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson stickup was the most brazen in a recent string of
drug-related burglaries that has veterinarians and police officials
on alert. Two Woodstock, Vt., vet clinics were broken into last
month. Since August, New Hampshire has seen more than a dozen
similar break-ins. Maine reports about the same number over the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of Special K as a party drug has turned
the vet clinics into targets. People who take the anesthetic _
intended for dogs, cats, and horses _ go into a demobilized,
trance-like state called a ``K-hole.'' The drug, and the trances,
have become standard components of ``raves,'' all-night dance
parties.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the break-ins have taken place after-hours, the
late afternoon armed robbery in Hudson has veterinarians
particularly concerned. Suddenly, working at the local vet clinic
feels a little like the overnight shift at the Store 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn fools are getting buzzed on it,'' said New Hampshire
state veterinarian Clifford McGinnis. ``It's been kind of a problem
now for three or four years _ it just seems (recently) it has just
broken out and become a continual rash of break-ins. . . . It's
gotten out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Some veterinary clinics, particularly in New Hampshire, are
starting to tighten security. They're installing new locks and more
secure safes. Some have considered removing the drug from clinics
each night and, borrowing from the Store 24 approach, posting signs
that say: ``No drugs on the premises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being a bank teller,'' McGinnis said. ``It's got to
be quite a shock to have somebody come in with a gun and ask for
something. I am so upset and I can't believe what's happening _ my
God.''
</P>
<P>
   The Plymouth Animal Hospital in Plymouth, N.H., was burglarized
twice this fall, said receptionist Kary Tobine. Another attempted
break-in failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took everything,'' she said. The drugs had been secured
in a safe, which the thieves broke open with what must have been a
crowbar, Tobine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put on new doors and deadbolt locks,'' said Tobine.
``And of course the drugs are locked in a better vault than what we
had before.''
</P>
<P>
   The damage done by the break-ins can extend beyond the vet
clinic walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ketamine is increasingly known as a ``date-rape'' drug. Billy
Yout, special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement
Administration in New Hampshire, said that ketamine can render
victims unconscious and vulnerable to sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing would be that they have no control over
their faculties _ that's what makes it so very, very dangerous,''
said Yout.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can see what's going on, but they can't move, they really
can't function at all,'' said Mike Gosselin, the Hudson detective
investigating the Nov. 22 armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Ketamine is addictive. And it can be lethal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other parts of the country it's a tremendous concern,''
said Yout. In the past few months, break-ins have been reported at
vet clinics from Worland, Wyo., to Tammany, La.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit in New England have been New Hampshire and Maine.
There were only a few similar break-ins reported in Vermont before
the two last month. And while the break-ins have been cooling off a
bit in Maine, New Hampshire is on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Grasso, the chief compliance investigator of the New
Hampshire Board of Pharmacy, said the number of break-ins since
mid-August could be higher than the 12 to 15 he knows about, since
some of them may not have been reported, especially repeat thefts.
</P>
<P>
   Drug-seeking thieves broke into the Riverside Animal Hospital in
Boscawen, N.H., three times. The first time, thieves triggered the
alarm, which is wired to the police department, and fled, said Dr.
Brad Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, they were back. They broke a window, Taylor
said, and ``took ketamine, and were gone before the police could
get here, so they did the whole thing with the alarm going off in
their face.'' When the thieves returned for a third try, Taylor
said, ``We had everything locked up so tight that they couldn't get
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disconcerting,'' said Taylor, who said veterinarians
are worried that animals could be harmed in a break-in. ``We take
it personally when somebody starts messing around with our
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the armed thief in Hudson was a teenager; that's
also been the case in many of the other ketamine thefts.
</P>
<P>
   If there are signs of a slowdown in the number of break-ins in
Maine, it's not yet being felt on the streets. ``We are seeing a
steady increase in (ketamine) possession cases and particularly in
the Portland area,'' said James Cameron, drug prosecution
coordinator for the state attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a Portland nightclub raid led to a number of
ketamine possession charges, Cameron said, and some Portland-area
concert-goers were recently caught with the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron said that he suspects the ketamine being sold in Maine
is coming from out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Zuckerman, a senior assistant attorney general in charge of
the criminal justice bureau in New Hampshire, said Special K is not
nearly as prevalent as the other rave drug of choice, ecstasy. But,
he said, ``who knows what these break-ins mean. Maybe that will be
changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Bruce Hansen of the Nashua Police Department said the
drug has been turning up there at raves. ``Oh, absolutely,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire last year stiffened the penalties for possessing
and selling ketamine, classifying it as a Schedule Three drug. A
first-offense charge of possession or sale of the drug can carry a
maximum seven-year prison term and fines of up to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, too, has strengthened laws against possession and
sale of ketamine, making it, like heroin, a Class A drug.
Possession and sale of the drug in Massachusetts can carry a
maximum prison term of 10 years and a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Maine has not followed suit; possession of ketamine there is
still a misdemeanor, Cameron said, punishable by up to six months
in jail and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Cameron, ketamine is ``a very dangerous drug. People
think of it as a party drug, but it's a lot more serious than
that.''

   What really matters is that he stated that what counts is an
individual's faith, not his obedience, the individual's
interpretation of the Bible, not some official's, two notions with
earth-shattering significance way beyond religion. What the
individual does in life (whether as a laborer or president) is done
as an instrument of God and thus breaks the old wall between
religious and secular vocations. Luther gave us ministers (another
word that would never be the same) chosen by congregations. After
he translate the Bible into German while in hiding, the word vulgar
would no longer mean simply any other language but Latin.
</P>
<P>
   But in life, he tended to favor the princes who supported his
monumental disobedience more than the peasants who sought redress
of their own grievances. The conflict between freedom and order
hardly ended with him. But his impact was transforming, not just
reforming. He da man.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL; 
JOAN VENNOCHI: Johannes Gutenberg &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the word. Then, Johannes Gutenberg came up with
a practical way to spread it. How could a person who earns a living
as a purveyor of the printed word not be enamored of that?
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge is power. In the 15th century, Gutenberg, the inventor
of moveable type, found a way to give every individual access to
it, through the printed word.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gutenberg, woodblock printing was common. A sheet of
paper was laid over the inked woodblock, and an impression was
taken by rubbing. This was complicated and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Gutenberg's invention split up the text into individual
components, such as lower and upper case letters, punctuation
marks, and abbreviations. These individual components were cast as
type in reverse, then put together to form words, lines, and pages.
To facilitate the casting of a character, Gutenberg developed the
hand casting instrument, which enabled quick casting of the
different characters needed. The casting metal was an alloy of
lead, tin, and other metals, which cooled quickly and were strong
enough to endure the high pressure of the press.
</P>
<P>
   Gutenberg's exact year of birth is unknown, but historians
believe it was some time around 1400. He was born in the German
city of Mainz, one of the wealthiest and most important cities
along the Rhine. His father was among the city's patricians.
Gutenberg died in 1468.
</P>
<P>
   Very little is known about Gutenberg's childhood and education.
Did he attend one of the seminaries or convent schools in Mainz?
Historians assume as much, because he would not be able to do what
he did without a comprehensive education.
</P>
<P>
   Gutenberg's family moved from Mainz in 1411, presumably to
escape political disputes within the city. As an adult, he lived
for a time in Strasbourg. In 1448, he was back in Mainz, a fact
documented by a loan from his brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The loan was probably critical to the rest of Gutenberg's story.
Three years after he received it, he tackled the massive project of
printing the bible.
</P>
<P>
   Printed in two volumes between 1454 and 1455, it had a total of
1,282 pages. Today, 48 of 180 copies remain in existence. The Bible
is Gutenberg's most famous publication and is still considered one
of the most beautiful books in the world.
</P>
<P>
   His invention touched everyone _ man, woman, and child, rich and
poor. It is universal in the sense of being the anchor for the
modern Information Age and the bridge to the next one. Yet its
impact is also as intimate as the comforting feeling you get when
you snuggle under the covers with a good book, or hear the
newspaper hit your front doorstep in the morning _ a feeling that a

JEFF JACOBY: Isaac Newton &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1665, an outbreak of plague forced Cambridge University to
close. Isaac Newton, a 23-year-old mathematics student who had just
earned his B.A., returned to his family's estate in Lincolnshire,
where he spent the next 18 months thinking and studying alone.
Those 18 months are without parallel in the past 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, Newton discovered the composition of light. He
proved that white light is a blend of all colors and that color
becomes visible only when light rays are refracted at different
angles. All of modern optics builds upon Newton's discovery. He
turned his attention to movement and inertia and worked out the
three essential laws of motion. The most famous is the third, known
to everyone: For every action, there is an equal and opposite
reaction. All of modern physics grows out of Newton's laws.
</P>
<P>
   The mathematics required to derive these laws _ which involve
multiple variables with continuously changing quantities _ did not
exist in Newton's day. So he invented an entirely new mathematical
discipline: the calculus. (Independently, the German scholar
Gottfried Leibniz would later devise it as well.) Modern
mathematics without the calculus is impossible to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Any of these achievements would have assured Newton's fame. But
the heights he scaled were greater still.
</P>
<P>
   In his garden one day, an apple really did fall. Newton pondered
the force that pulled it to the earth. It was a force that seemed
to operate even at great distances _ an apple dropping from the
highest tree imaginable would still hit the ground. How far out did
this force reach? All the way to the moon? Yet the moon didn't fall
to the earth, but traveled around it instead. Why?
</P>
<P>
   The problem of celestial movement vexed the intellectuals of
Newton's day. They envisioned a globe being swung on a chain,
circling round and round, centripetal force holding it in a steady
orbit. Cut the chain and the circling stops _ the globe flies off
in a straight line. But heavenly bodies don't fly off in straight
lines. Though untethered by chains, they move in fixed orbits. How
could that be?
</P>
<P>
   Alone in Lincolnshire, Newton solved the puzzle: He discovered
the law of gravity. The same force that pulls an apple to the
ground holds distant planets in their paths. That was the chain
linking the moon to the earth and the planets to the sun. Gravity
couldn't be seen or touched, but it could be proved with an elegant
mathematical formula. And that formula, Newton said, ``allows me to
explain the system of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 20 years, Newton told no one of his discovery. When
he finally published the ``Principia,'' his great treatise on
motion and gravitation, the effect was seismic. Newton's discovery,
says Alan Charles Kors, a renowned scholar of Western thought, ``is
one of the most extraordinary scientific syntheses in the history
of the human mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Principia'' rocked Western civilization, for it showed
that the universe was lawful, logical _ above all, knowable. To a
deeply pious Europe, it meant that mere mortals could perceive the
very blueprint of Creation. To study the world empirically, to
understand its workings, was to come closer to God. Newton's legacy
was nothing less than the triumph of modern science.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Alexander Pope's famous epitaph:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night,
</P>
<P>
   God said, Let Newton be! _ and all was light.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ She has the face of a child _ still full with
youth, her lips pressed into a permanent pout _ and a childlike
need to be liked and to belong.
</P>
<P>
   He has sunken cheeks, small eyes, and a manner that friends say
can swing between docility and rage: calm unless provoked, quiet
until he drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Separated by a generation, shaped by troubled pasts and
shattered families, Julie Barnes, 19, and Tom Levesque, 37, found a
connection in Worcester's streets. On and off for about a year,
they huddled together in shelters and nestled in vacant buildings,
nurturing a volatile, sometimes violent love.
</P>
<P>
   According to their friends and acquaintances, the shelter
denizens who knew them, the couple bickered constantly and
occasionally came to blows. They lost a child to miscarriage and,
three months ago, conceived another.
</P>
<P>
   After one heated squabble, Barnes asked for a restraining order.
A judge denied it the same day for reasons that remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a few forays into court, Levesque and Barnes lived what
one local priest calls a ``subterranean'' existence: shadows of
lives the rest of the world rarely sees.
</P>
<P>
   He rummaged through trash bins for cans. She spent hours in
MediaPlay, a local music store. They were fixtures in downtown
Worcester, but often barely noticed.
</P>
<P>
   That changed after their last fight on a chilly Friday night
more than two weeks ago, in their makeshift home in the vacant,
heatless Worcester Cold Storage &AMP; Warehouse Co. building.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of an argument, a candle fell over, starting a
fire they couldn't put out.
</P>
<P>
   Six firefighters died in the blaze, a fire so intense it burned
for a week before finally going cold. And Levesque and Barnes, who
had slipped away before the fire trucks arrived, were arrested for
involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Now their names and faces are fixed in the collective conscience
of Worcester, as objects of anger, or sympathy, or wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the homeless people who dot the city's streets, there are
always stories, tales of dead ends and hardships, said Liz Dicenzo,
supervisor at Public Inebriate Program, the Worcester shelter where
Levesque and Barnes were known to stay, and where some residents
know Dicenzo as ``Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's at the PIP shelter because they want to be here,''
Dicenzo said. ``They're here because they have to be. They have
nowhere else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The children at Worcester East Middle School and North High
School had a litany of derisive nicknames for Julie Barnes when she
was their classmate: ``scrub,'' ``loser,'' ``dirty slut,'' and
``Downtown Julie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers can be cruel, even proudly so, to people who are
different, and in the cutthroat world of Worcester public schools,
Barnes did not fit in. She dropped out in the 11th grade.
</P>
<P>
   Her former classmates say she seemed slow, had been held back a
year, and was enrolled in some special education classes. She wore
clothing that was dirty or ripped, or too-small pants that stopped
just above her ankles. Her hair hung stringy and greasy. She
carried cats to school in her backpack. Her classmates teased her
mercilessly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she lingered around them, several North High students say,
trying to strike up conversations, brag about her boyfriends, or
pay misplaced compliments (``I really like your chapstick,'' she
once told a girl).
</P>
<P>
   She laughed, even when the jokes were about her.
</P>
<P>
   If the teasing became too intense, someone in the crowd usually
stepped in and told her tormenters to ``back off,'' said a onetime
classmate, 18, who called himself Alex. But there were many more
times when no one intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was there to laugh at,'' said Alex, who still attends
North High. ``She was, like, one sandwich short of a picnic
basket.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems a constant in Barnes's life that even those who care
about her, and sympathize with her, speak about her cruelly, and
that her relationships with her closest relatives often have been
strained.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, a cab driver named Kevin Castonguay, told the
Worcester Telegram and Gazette that he and Barnes's mother, Evelyn
Menard, split up in the early 1980s. Barnes and a sister, now 21,
lived with Menard and their stepfather for a time, Castonguay said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the state Department of Social Services intervened in
the mid-1980s after reports of sexual abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   The department ``does not have an open case'' on Barnes, a
department spokesman said, but he would not give specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Castonguay took custody of the girls in 1992, he told the
newspaper, but he had a hard time with Barnes when she turned 16.
She was belligerent, stole things, and sometimes slipped away from
home to stay at shelters. When she was 18, she moved out for good.
</P>
<P>
   After she started to spend time on the streets, a friend named
Virgil Larose, a self-described biker, took her in. He called
Barnes ``my little granddaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's called me Grandpa and I've protected her, watched over
her, and I won't let nobody hurt her,'' Larose said outside a
Worcester courthouse after a hearing this week. Barnes could not be
guilty of manslaughter charges, he said, because she was too
helpless to be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``That little girl don't have the brains to do something like
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to friends, Barnes and Levesque met when Levesque was
living with her aunt, Norma Barnes. He was the father of Norma
Barnes's twin children.
</P>
<P>
   Levesque, who wandered in and out of temporary jobs, was also
the product of a troubled home; one friend recalled that he talked
about being thrown out by his mother when he was about 10 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has never been convicted of a crime, Levesque had been
arrested on charges that were later dismissed: in 1993, for assault
and battery against a girlfriend, who claimed he punched her; and
in 1994, for disorderly conduct. Two former girlfriends received
restraining orders against him in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 request, Kelly Marie Johnson said Levesque
``threatened to do something to me and my husband. He also
threatened to kill me and beat me up,'' the Telegram and Gazette
reported. And in a 1995 request, Norma Barnes, wrote that Levesque
``has threatened to come after me if I don't let him see his
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew him said Levesque has a jealous streak that often
spun him into a rage, but others said he also could be quiet and
calm.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joe Coonan, pastor of a local Catholic church that aids
the homeless, remembered Levesque wheeling a shopping cart through
the neighborhood, searching for cans in church trash bins,
sometimes coming to the rectory for aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``When asking for food, he was almost shy, and very passive and
polite,'' Coonan said.
</P>
<P>
   Levesque made connections among Worcester's homeless, and was
loyal to his friends, one man said. ``Unless you got him riled or
if he started drinking, he was a good guy,'' he said. ``He'd go out
of his way for you.''
</P>
<P>
   But alcohol was a problem for Levesque, friends and
acquaintances said _ though he sometimes tried to break free of the
cycle. Nearly a year ago, he was enrolled in a detox program at
Public Inebriate, and seemed to do well for a time, working in the
shelter kitchen, and taking medication, said Barry Bennett, 37, who
was in the program with him.
</P>
<P>
   Levesque could lash out violently when provoked, residents of
the Public Inebriate Program said, and his relationship with Barnes
seemed, at times, a constant provocation.
</P>
<P>
   The pair argued constantly: about where they would sleep, what
they would eat, why he worked such long hours.
</P>
<P>
   Levesque tried to control Barnes's friendships, said Norma
Johnson, 49, a homeless woman who befriended them. He even took her
along when he went to find work.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes could hold her own in a fight, Norma Johnson said; she
would swing at him and pelt him with her high-heeled shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But there were times when they were quiet, too.
</P>
<P>
   Often, they would sit together in the shelter and play with the
kitten Barnes carried in a red fanny pack. They looked after the
cat, taking care that it didn't get on the floor, so it wouldn't
run away.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter for the Public Inebriate Program was one of
Worcester's few safe havens for homeless people, a place many
return to again and again when they're down on their luck.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are reasons why some homeless people choose not to
live in shelters, those who know and help them say. Some are HIV
positive, and fear they could contract illnesses from another
resident. Some are wary of other people, afraid of getting into
fights. Some prefer to stay outside and drink.
</P>
<P>
   Levesque might not have had a choice; three or four weeks before
the fire, he was kicked out of the shelter, apparently after an
altercation with the staff. It was then, shelter residents said,
that he moved into the Worcester Cold Storage building.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how often Barnes joined him there, but the pair had
been there long enough for local business owners to know about
their presence. On the night of the fire, the owner of a diner
across the street told firefighters there were homeless people
inside.
</P>
<P>
   According to the story Barnes told Larose, the fire broke out
after she and Levesque got into a fight. She said Levesque slapped
her, and she stood up in reaction, knocking over a candle they had
lit.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the fire caught onto clothing and papers, and
quickly spread out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Levesque and Barnes were arrested four days later. They were
charged with six counts of involuntary manslaughter, and bail was
set at $1 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Levesque is undergoing a psychiatric evaluation in
Bridgewater. Barnes was interviewed by a court psychologist who
reported that she was of ``less than average intelligence,'' but
was competent to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Barnes are likely to argue that she and Levesque had
no legal obligation to report the fire, or to tell anyone that they
were not in the building.
</P>
<P>
   As Barnes awaits another hearing, she is sad, remorseful, and
confused, said her attorneys, Michael Wilcox and Louis Aloise. She
has had a string of visitors, they said: her mother, her
stepfather, her father, Larose.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the state Department of Correction will offer
prenatal care for her unborn child, said Aloise. If Barnes is still
in prison when she gives birth, the state will take custody of the
child, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The child could be sent to foster care, or to live with Barnes's
mother. It's a decision for another day, another life.

 SOFIA, Bulgaria: ... the Holocaust.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the former East Germany, where it is estimated that about 5
percent of the population of 17 million supplied information to the
Stasi about relatives and friends, people are only now getting
access to the Stasi files. CIA analysts have picked over the files
for a decade, but now ordinary people are learning who informed on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say these disclosures will tear families apart and turn
neighbor against neighbor needlessly. In what was East Berlin,
Klaus Himmel, a retired baker, says he has no interest in finding
out if he has a Stasi file.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past is the past,'' he said, sitting in a Turkish coffee
shop. ``People here spend so much time worrying about the past that
they ruin the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Werkentin, the deputy in charge of Stasi files, says that unless
the past is confronted, there is no future.

<P>
   The status of women
</P>
<P>
   DUBI, Czech Republic _ Afternoons are slow here. So there are
only a few dozen hookers lining the roads of this gloomy town on
the German border.
</P>
<P>
   At night, however, it becomes surreal, with hundreds of women
dressed in short skirts and high heels, some of them flashing their
breasts at passing motorists. Inside the seedy hotels and bars that
line the E55 highway, there are even more women who can't work
outside because they were smuggled here from other parts of Eastern
Europe by gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   The booming sex industry of Dubi is a product of the free-market
economy that is struggling to find its feet in the old Soviet bloc.
Women in more legitimate areas of employment are not doing as well
as the hookers of Dubi.
</P>
<P>
   Under communism, women were, in theory, the equals of men. They
worked alongside men in jobs considered nontraditional in the West.
But since the collapse of communism, women have suffered
disproportionately.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released in September, UNICEF found that the living
standards of women and girls throughout the former Soviet bloc had
deteriorated. Of the 25 million jobs lost since the collapse of
communism, 14 million were held by women.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the transition to a market economy, the status of women is
eroding further,'' said Carol Bellamy, UNICEF's chief.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 countries UNICEF studied, the life expectancy of women had
gone down, due mostly to increases in smoking and alcohol
consumption, drug abuse, and the unsafe sexual activity that has
proliferated in places like Dubi.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, UNICEF found there were about 30,000 cases of
HIV in the former Soviet bloc. By last year, that number had
climbed to 270,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under communism, women were better represented in politics, even
if it was a one-party system. Women used to make up about a third
of communist lawmakers, but now account for about 10 percent of
those in the parliaments of fledgling democracies in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Blatant sexism and discrimination are tolerated throughout the
region. Want ads in newspapers, even in places considered
progressive, such as Prague, ask for ``attractive'' women to fill
secretarial jobs. Some ads say that anyone over a certain age is
not welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is welcome in Dubi. German men flock here. The hookers
of Dubi charge about $35 for a half-hour, about half the price of
German prostitutes. The E55 in Dubi is also lined with open-air
markets run by Vietnamese, where people load up on cheap beer,
booze, and clothing, much of it bootleg designer wear.
</P>
<P>
   Jana, a 20-year-old Czech, insists that working in Dubi is not
so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work for myself,'' she said, standing on the side of the
road, trying to make eye contact with male drivers. ``This is
better than working in a bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jana's claims, men still take a disproportionate amount
of women's earnings. Without a pimp in Dubi, a prostitute doesn't
last very long. Serbian gangsters operating out of the Hotel Bihac
treat the young women they smuggled here from Ukraine and Bulgaria
like indentured servants.
</P>
<P>
   While Jana talks about being empowered by being able to take to
the streets, many other women tell of feeling systematically
hampered. Anna Buresova, 34, is typical. Before the Velvet
Revolution of 1989, she worked as a translator at a
state-controlled press agency in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, the agency was liquidated and we were thrown out,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She got married and had two children, but when she tried to get
back into the job market she found that the child care that was
standard under communism was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one would hire me because they didn't want anyone who had
children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When her son developed pneumonia and she got sick taking care of
him, her husband stayed home for three days to care for them. The
trucking company he worked for fired him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That never would have happened under the old system,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of trying to find work, she recently got a job
as a police investigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sought a job in the public sector because the private sector
will not accommodate working mothers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some argue that women have opportunities today they would
never have under communism. Nela Vamporova, 24, a student in Sofia,
says women were never the equals of men under communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother worked at a factory just like my father, but when
they came home my father sat on the couch and my mother had to make
dinner and take care of us kids,'' she said. ``It wasn't the
feminist ideal some people talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far from Dubi, at the orphanage in Teplice, half of the 70
beds are occupied by babies born to prostitutes. Dr. Jirina
Rejtrova, who runs the orphanage, says most of the babies arrive
without names or identity papers. Their mothers drop them off and
head back to the E55 in Dubi. They've got to go to work.

   Clear and present danger
</P>
<P>
   KOZLODUY, Bulgaria _ When the Soviet bloc collapsed, one of the
first things the West pledged to do was clean up and close
high-risk nuclear plants in Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The meltdown at Chernobyl in 1986 offered incentive, and, with
the cash pipeline to Moscow cut off, the governments of former
Soviet satellites were anxious to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 years later, only Chernobyl's Unit 4, where the disaster
struck, has been closed. There are at least 26 nuclear reactors
considered by Western specialists to be in the high-risk category
for an accident, including the plant in Kozloduy. Those specialists
consider four of the six reactors here to be among the most
dangerous and prone to accident in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But nuclear power provides Bulgaria with nearly half of its
electricity _ compared to less than 20 percent in the United States
_ and the cash-strapped government in Sofia has found it cheaper
and easier to upgrade the plant than put it in mothballs.
</P>
<P>
   This is, according to some specialists, a dangerous gamble, one
taken not only because the Bulgarian government lacks the money and
the political will, but because the European Union and the G7 group
of industrialized nations, including the United States, failed to
follow through with pledges of aid.
</P>
<P>
   Antony Froggatt, a London-based nuclear power analyst and author
of ``EU Accession and Nuclear Power,'' said the West sent
conflicting messages about how serious it was about closing
high-risk nuclear reactors. He said a 1992 study by the G7
estimated that between $18 billion and $24 billion was needed to
either upgrade existing plants or replace them with alternative
energy sources by 2000. He said the West has donated about $2
billion, including $500 million from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is supposed to be a priority, it's not a good
record,'' he said. ``The main problem is there hasn't been a
unified message from the West on what to do. Some say close them
down, while Western business is saying we can patch them up. The
dilemma is, if you invest in the facilities, these countries turn
around and say they are safe and won't close them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Froggatt points to Kozloduy as the prime example of a confused
policy. It was the first plant to receive Western funds meant to
ease its reactors into retirement, but today there is no agreement
to close it down.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office here, Kozloduy plant manager Krassimir
Nikolov insists his plant is safe. Nikolov bears a resemblance to
Clinton, and shares the president's gift for charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upgrading has been made and we are approaching Western
standards of operation,'' he said. ``Kozloduy will never be the
next Chernobyl.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikolov says he believes it is politics, not science, that is
behind the push by the West to close down the plant. He was in
Ukraine, less than 200 miles from Chernobyl, when the disaster
occurred. He remembers seeing people fleeing the area around
Chernobyl, their heads shaved to get rid of the radioactive
particles. Nine years after the accident, he went to Chernobyl and
saw ``a large city so empty.''
</P>
<P>
   But that experience has strengthened his resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of nuclear safety is much higher than 13 years
ago,'' he said. ``There are many victims of car accidents, but
nobody has given up driving. This is the way of technological
progress. The other way is back to the caves.''
</P>
<P>
   The plant here employs 6,600 people, and it is keen on its
image. Promotional material says the power it produces is
``reliable, nature friendly, necessary.'' A banner hanging across
the main street of the town proclaims that the plant has provided
``25 Years of Energy and Clean Nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivancho Guergov, a shift unit supervisor, says workers see
claims from Western specialists that Kozloduy is an accident
waiting to happen as unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is safe,'' he said. ``There is more radiation on
the streets of Sofia than here.''
</P>
<P>
   But such pledges did not completely reassure Dimitar Lozanov,
10, when he and his classmates toured the plant recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a program about this on the Discovery Channel, and they
talked about radiation all over Europe,'' the boy told Geurgov,
citing a source of information that didn't exist here 10 years ago.
``If they blow up, the whole country would blow up.''
</P>
<P>
   As she shopped in the town market with her 7-year-old daughter
and 4-year-old son, Julia Dimitrova said she knew no one who
worried about the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother works there,'' she said. ``There's never been a
problem. I was worried during the war in Kosovo, because some
missiles landed in Bulgaria. But I don't believe people who say
Kozloduy is the most dangerous in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The EU has given Bulgaria until 2005 to close the reactors. But
Nikolov says his plant made it possible for Bulgaria's application
to join the EU to be accepted this month. To qualify for EU
membership, countries must keep inflation and borrowing in check.
Nikolov says cheap power has helped in both areas.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of activists led by those belonging to Za Zemiata,
an environmental group, appear to be the only people in Bulgaria
who want the reactors shut down. Polina Kireva, Za Zemiata's
nuclear project head, says support for nuclear power is a hangover
from communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are pronuclear because the Kozloduy plant is a
socialist success story,'' she said. ``The plant's backers have
been able to convince most people that attempts to close the plant
are part of a conspiracy theory, to deny Bulgaria one of its great
successes, and so other countries can cash in and sell us power.''
</P>
<P>
   Kireva says changing attitudes will, like the demolition of
Georgy Dimitrov's mausoleum, take time and patience.

PSYCHOANALYST-NOVELIST NOT AFRAID TO PLAY ON WOOLF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CLEA SIMON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ORLANDA 
By Jacqueline Harpman (translated, from the French, by Ros
Schwartz) 
Seven Stories Press, $22, 224 pp., $22 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reworking Virginia Woolf has come into vogue recently, with
books like Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning ``The Days''
reconsidering the author's stories from alternate viewpoints.
Belgian author and psychoanalyst Jacqueline Harpman does Woolf one
better though, in her 12th novel, the newly translated ``Orlanda.''
In this brief, light read, winner of France's Prix Medicis, Harpman
not only updates Woolf's ``Orlando,'' the tale of a gender-shifting
protagonist, she also makes her protagonist a literary scholar, one
who is deeply critical of Woolf.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Harpman's take on Woolf's classic is a direct parallel.
Rather than having one character shift sexes, as Orlando does,
Harpman's heroine, Aline, splits to live simultaneously in the
original female body and in that of a young man, Lucien, whom Aline
briefly, nearly unconsciously, admires in a train station. As
befits the creation of a psychoanalyst's mind, Aline's male persona
(who renames himself Orlanda) is really the rambunctious youthful
part of herself that she repressed upon hitting the latency period
that precedes adolescence. That this splinter personality decides
to take up residence in a handsome young man, 20 years old to
Aline's 35, is a result of society and convenience. Orlanda knows
that in a man's body he/she will be more free to play and to
experiment sexually. Perhaps more important for the impulsive
10-year-old spirit, the male ``host'' was there, sitting beside the
heroine in the station _ a place of transition _ at just the right
time.
</P>
<P>
   No, Aline does not have a multiple-personality disorder. Harpman
plays her story very straight, a metaphor that comes to life as
Aline works on an analysis of the Woolf original, which she
initially dreads. As if disowning the magic in her otherwise
realistic novel, Harpman occasionally inserts herself as a third
voice: a narrator who washes her hands of her errant characters as
they defy nature and personal boundaries to follow their own whims.
Her narrator's air of bemusement colors the entire book, and
actually makes the more far-fetched parts seem feasible. ``I think
he reminds me of a love affair that I did not have, because I was
too young or too silly,'' she writes about her newly emerged
Orlanda, and muses further: ``Unfortunately, I did not have the
presence of mind to turn into a boy and become adventurous.'' In
general, her breezy style works, making what could be a too-clever
work amusing and, at times, beautiful. ``Let us listen too for a
while,'' she writes of a concert attended by Orlanda. ``Time kills
us, second after second, and we fools continue to be impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   However, this same air of detachment also shackles Harpman's
story. On occasion, she skims too lightly, risking superficiality
with observations like: ``Where is my sense of propriety . . . to
my utter amazement, I see that she is smiling. Orlanda's influence
has really transformed her!'' Besides, its lighthearted approach
makes a deep connection to these characters' emotional lives
difficult; it's hard to feel that the entire book is anything but
an intellectual conceit. ``I have no blood on my hands, just a
little ink,'' Harpman herself admits, dismissing final
responsibility for her characters _ and perhaps for the work. For
all its spots of glory, as well as its occasional insights into the
older work, ``Orlanda'' remains a pleasurable pastime, an amusement
of the ``what if'' sort, but one a disciplined academic like Aline
would likely dismiss.

&HT;     GLUT OF CASHMERE LEADS TO LOWER PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VANESSA HUA  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A glut of cashmere fiber, stockpiled by herdsmen
during the past two years after demand had fallen in economically
depressed Asian countries, has caused prices to drop to historic
lows.
</P>
<P>
   Mass-market retailers in the United States have been able to
offer the luxury product at unusually low prices, industry experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the hardy goats from the high mountains and plateaus
of China, central Asia and India each produce just four to six
ounces of cashmere fiber each year. The manufacturing process also
is time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   To collect the fiber, workers brush or shear the goats, then
separate the soft underdown from the coarse outer coat. It takes
cashmere fiber from four goats to make one woman's sweater. The low
yield and production costs make cashmere costly _ until this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the widespread availability of cashmere has caused some
consumers to question the price and quality.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Miller, 30, of San Francisco, spent hundreds of dollars
on her cashmere sweaters and paid to have them repaired when moths
chewed through the fine knit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get a good wear out of it,'' said Miller, who
considers cashmere an investment and said she was suspicious of
this year's lower-priced offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``pashmina'' (shawls made from a blend of cashmere and
silk) also has created some confusion among shoppers and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pashmina is a rare cashmere that comes from the underbelly of
Himalayan goats,'' said Ken Seiff, chief executive officer of
Bluefly.com, an on-line retailer that sold out its stock of
pashmina several times this season.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, scoffed officials at the Cashmere and Camel Hair
Manufacturers Institute in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pashmina is just a fancy word,'' said institute President Karl
Spilhaus. The institute's examination of pashmina under a
microscope found it was no different from other cashmere fiber, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The move of cashmere into the mass market may not last. Next
year, prices for cashmere and other items are expected to be much
higher, with high demand and a smaller supply already doubling the
price of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale price of white cashmere used in knitwear rose from
$60 to $120 per kilo, said Alex Shlomm, purchasing manager for New
York-based manufacturer Amicale Industries, which buys and spins
goat hair into yarn in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farmers and merchants get excited and keep jumping the
price up,'' Shlomm said.

&HT;     THE MOTHER-IN-LAW FROM HELL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has never been law than the one who wreaks conjugal havoc
in ``Leila.'' Her shrill sitcom sisters have nothing on the
relentlessly selfish harridan pulling the strings in Iranian
director Dariush Mehrjui's devastating account of an infertile
bride poisoned by devotion to a tradition not even her loving
husband supports.
</P>
<P>
   Leila and Reza (Leila Hatami and the great Ali Mossaffa) agree
that her inability to conceive will not be a barrier to their
happiness as a couple. But once it becomes clear to his family that
she can't have children, his mother plants this meddling seed in
Leila's head: Let Reza have a second wife so my son can have the
family I deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Like the transfixing films of his countrymen Abbas Kiarostami
and Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Mehrjui (``The Cow'') dares to draws his
culture's social politics on emotional terms.
</P>
<P>
   Leila is a woman in turmoil long before she serves as a
metaphor. By the time she tells Reza that she thinks he ought to
consider taking on another woman, she has already forced herself
into the shadows and spends the remainder of this willfully
infuriating film similarly self-effaced, resigning herself to the
guest room of her marriage. Repeatedly Leila is told to pray, but
she doesn't need Allah, she needs a therapist. But as written by
Mehrjui with Mahnaz Ansarian and eloquently acted by first-timer
Hatami, Leila is a tragic ball of confusion that any other
mother-in-law could love.

    NEW YORK'S CASES OF RACIAL INJUSTICE  
 Commentary    (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH    c.1999 Albany Times Union   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If Lucy
McKnight had ever been certain of anything, she was certain she had
been wronged. She had been working for the New York State Dormitory
Authority. An active Democrat and an African-American, she had been
hired during the administration of Mario Cuomo. After George Pataki
and his Republicans took over New York state government in 1994,
McKnight suffered health problems and missed some work. When she
was fired, she noted that a number of white folks with similar
absences hadn't been discharged. So McKnight filed suit against the
dormitory authority alleging racial discrimination. When the suit
finally made it to federal court a few weeks back, McKnight was
appalled to discover that all 100 people who made up the jury pool
were white. There would not be a single black face on the jury that
would hear her case. There's a reason for that. The federal court
district covering the northeastern portion of this sprawling,
50,000-square-mile state constitutes a part of the world where
black folks make up less than 3 percent of the population. Plus the
federal jury pool is culled from voter rolls and New York State
Department of Motor Vehicle records. Statistically,
African-Americans are less likely than whites to be voters,
licensed drivers or car owners. McKnight lost her case. She
believes firmly that if the jury had contained even one member who
had had a gut sense of what racial discrimination feels like, she
would have won. That may or not be true, but the intensity of
McKnight's conviction in this matter is only one more indication of
the stunning gulf that stretches between whites and minorities on
issues like this. Now, in this town, we're about to see another
illustration of just how immense that gulf can be. We'll see it
when four New York City police officers go on trial, probably late
next month, for the shooting death on Feb. 4 of a black West
African immigrant in the Bronx. Amadou Diallo, an innocent man, was
standing in a darkened doorway late at night. Four officers hunting
a rape suspect approached him, guns in hand. What happened next
will be the crux of this murder case against the cops. Diallo
either did something to lead the cops to believe mistakenly that he
was reaching for a weapon or they behaved with criminal
recklessness when they fired 41 slugs into that vestibule. This has
been a huge and heavily publicized case in New York City. In the
spring, the Rev. Al Sharpton led daily protests outside police
headquarters in Manhattan. More than 1,700 people, many show
business celebrities and prominent politicians, managed to get
themselves arrested at the demonstrations. Now an appeals court has
ruled that New York City media coverage has been so feverish that
the cops could never get a fair trial there. Instead, the cop will
be tried in Albany, the closest New York jurisdiction of any size
that doesn't watch New York City television stations. The Bronx
district attorney will prosecute this case. But instead of the jury
being chosen from a pool in the Bronx, where whites constitute a
distinct minority, this jury instead will be drawn from Albany
County, where the jury pool is 92 percent white. It should be
remembered, too, that the last time police officers went on trial
in this town charged with excessive violence against a black
arrestee _ just a few months back, in the infamous, foul-smelling
Jermaine Henderson case _ an all-white jury found the police
officers not guilty. Henderson had alleged, in rather plausible
terms, that the cops had beaten him while he was in handcuffs. But
the Albany County district attorney's office _ apparently eager to
take a dive that even Greg Louganis would have envied _ had
threatened to prosecute him for perjury if he testified in open
court because of inconsistencies in his grand jury testimony.
Henderson stayed away from the trial, and the cops walked. This
Diallo disaster will be a huge, hot case in Albany. The courthouse
is bound to be encircled daily by protesters bussed up from New
York City. Sharpton is sure to be at his loudest and least
responsible. Meanwhile, Lucy McKnight and other African-Americans
all over New York will be watching closely, as will most white
people, too. Each from their own side of that yawning gulf we were
talking about.    (Dan Lynch is a columnist for the Albany Times

THE LOWDOWN FROM WOODY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It seems odd that Woody Allen would wait till his
30th movie to make one about jazz. Everybody knows about his
passion for New Orleans jazz in particular, his Monday nights
playing clarinet at the Carlyle Hotel, and, for years before that,
at Michael's Pub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always wanted to make a jazz film,'' Allen says, ``but I
could never afford it. The jazz that I'd do a film about comes from
a different era. I figured I'd need to shoot in New Orleans,
Chicago, Harlem, maybe Paris, with costumes, elaborate props.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've, at times, thought about doing a film about Sidney
Bechet,'' the great clarinetist and soprano saxophone player. ``I'm
suited to do that story, but it was just too expensive, so . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly, his production company came up with $28 million _
``for me, that's a fortune,'' Allen says, ``it's the most expensive
movie I've ever made.'' The result, which opens in Boston Friday,
is ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' about a legendary (but fictitious) jazz
guitar player of the 1930s named Emmet Ray (played by Sean Penn).
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea, in a completely different form, was sitting around
in my drawer for years, like most of my ideas for films,'' Allen
says, sitting in a Manhattan hotel room that his studio has booked
for promotional interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Allen doesn't get around much anymore when it comes to modern
jazz; he has never heard of the clarinetist Don Byron or of Masada
(John Zorn's acclaimed jazz group, which includes Greg Cohen, who
plays bass in Allen's own Carlyle band).
</P>
<P>
   Still, his tastes extend well beyond Dixieland. ``I'm a great,
great fan, a huge fan, of Bud Powell's,'' he says, referring to the
master pianist of the be-bop era. ``If Icould choose to trade my
talent for anyone's, it would be Bud Powell's. I love modern jazz.
I'm devoted to Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Monk, Charlie Parker,
Ornette Coleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Has he ever considered playing that sort of jazz? ``I can't play
it,'' he replies. ``It's much too difficult for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen's films have always had a strong musical element. It could
be argued that ``Manhattan'' restored Gershwin to the soundscape of
New York City. His use of a Schubert string quartet cleverly
accented the anxiety of the murder scene in ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors.'' A Bach concerto stretched the tension before the
first kiss in ``Hannah and Her Sisters.'' Prokofiev's ``Lieutenant
Kije'' added a buoyancy to ``Love and Death.''
</P>
<P>
   All these pieces came from Allen's own stash of LPs. ``It's the
highest form of pleasure I get in making a film, the putting in of
music,'' he says, leaning forward on the couch with unusual
enthusiasm. ``I get to go through my record collection and select
anything, from Beethoven to Monk to Errol Garner. It's so much
better than hiring someone to write a score.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen turned 64 on Dec. 1. He looks like someone who hasn't seen
the sun for a decade; his neck is wrinkling, wisps of gray streak
his hair, his voice has a softly groggy quality. But otherwise, he
seems remarkably the same as when he emerged as a stand-up comic in
the early 1960s, or as a film director in 1969. There are the same
thick horn-rimmed glasses, the slightly pained arched eyebrows, the
muffled cough before he speaks.
</P>
<P>
   There are the same ``issues,'' too. Back in his 20s, he devoted
whole monologues to his obsession with death. Now that he's at an
age when perfectly normal people brood on mortality, has his
perspective changed?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's the same,'' he says, evenly. ``It's hard for me to
enjoy anything because I'm always aware how transient things
are.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Strategies of surviving'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what about that wonderful scene in ``Hannah and Her
Sisters,'' when his character, after botching a suicide attempt,
wanders into a theater where a Marx Brothers movie is playing and
realizes that life is a pleasure after all?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there are strategies of surviving,'' he concedes. ``There
are times when you think, `My God, life is sweet, it's nice,' and
thoughts of mortality are in abeyance. You know, watching the Marx
Brothers or a Knicks game or listening to great jazz, you get a
great feeling of ecstasy. You're in a great moment watching Michael
Jordan. But then it passes, and the dark reality of life starts to
creep back in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to determine whether my own slant on this
is accurate or whether other people's slant is. I'm the one who
runs around pulling on people's lapels and saying, `Don't you
understand what's happening? We're in a concentration camp here! We
get our small bowl of potato soup, then it's off to the ovens!' I
feel I'm running around saying this and everybody else doesn't see
it. I could say to myself, `You know, I guess they're right.' But
there's something in me that tells me they're not right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody, a greater wit than I, once said, `The issue is
whether the coffin is half-full or the coffin is half-empty.' '' He
chuckles for the first time in a while. ``I wish I'd said that.
That's the way I look at things.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his morbidity, Allen insists he's a normal, even dull
fellow: ``Francine du Plessix Gray wrote a profile of me where she
said, `There are no great Woody Allen stories.' It's true. I don't
have any great anecdotes that have happened to me in a film. I've
never had any untoward incidents. I come in the morning, talk
sports with the camera crew, shoot, have lunch, shoot. There are no
tantrums by any of the actors, no tantrums by me. It's a very
ordinary kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, that one ``untoward incident,'' the affair
with Soon-Yi Previn, the adopted daughter of his then-girlfriend,
Mia Farrow, and the ensuing scandal and the custody battle over his
and Farrow's shared children. (He and Previn have since married and
had their own child.) His films are widely scoured for clues to his
own state of mind: the attraction to very young women
(``Manhattan,'' ``Husbands and Wives''), fantasies of kidnapping
his child from an ex-wife (``Deconstructing Harry''). In ``Sweet
and Lowdown,'' the protagonist, a great artist but a lousy human
being, dumps his ideal woman, then realizes too late he's made a
mistake. One New York tabloid, noting that the woman (played by
Samantha Morton) resembles Farrow, concluded Allen must feel he
made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that most frustrates me,'' Allen says, ``is when
people confuse my characters with me. They won't take my denials,
no matter how cogently I explain it. I can see why they could think
that. Unlike Charlie Chaplin or W. C. Fields, I appear in a movie
in my clothes, living in New York, the character is close to me in
dimension. But the stories are totally fabricated. `Annie Hall' is
not autobiographical. Harry Block, the character in `Deconstructing
Harry,' is a writer, but he has no bearing on my life. People
sympathetic to me don't like to hear this, and people who don't
like me want confirmation of their worst thoughts about me _ you
know, `I always knew he was like Harry Block.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Allen is often called ``obsessive'' in his work; few directors
make a movie every year, as he does, like clockwork. ``Jean-Luc
Godard said I make too many films,'' Allen acknowledges with a
shrug. ``I enjoy making movies. I have many ideas, some good, some
not so good. I make them for myself. It keeps me busy. It keeps me
from sitting home, dwelling on the dark side of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I'm a `workaholic,' but I'm really not,'' he goes
on. ``I get up in the daytime, I spend time with my family, I go to
Knicks games. I watch baseball, football, or basketball all the
time. I play with my band. I go out to dinner practically every
night. The truth is, if you write a little bit each day, you get a
lot accomplished. To do one film a year is not a big
accomplishment. A few months to write, a couple months'
pre-production, a couple months' shooting _ all in all, making a
movie takes about nine months, and it's not even a concentrated
nine months. Then I have three months of nothing.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Alternate lives &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years, starting in the mid-1960s, Allen wrote a string of
gem-like comic short stories for The New Yorker. Asked if he could
see himself dropping movies and going back to that medium, he was
surprisingly accommodating to the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wrote a New Yorker piece recently, for their 75th
anniversary issue,'' he reveals. (It comes out in February.) ``If I
couldn't get financed or was too old and tired, I could see very
comfortably sitting home and writing comedic pieces or try writing
a novel. That would be fun for me. In the long run, I'll wind up
doing that because I can't imagine doing films my whole life.
They're too much physical work. I would kind of enjoy writing
pieces to some degree even now, but I feel it would be a
self-indulgence. I'm still vigorous and healthy. It would be a
shame not to keep making movies as long as I have the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had any regrets in the way his career shaped up, he
muses, ``I would have liked to have gone to a great private school
and a wonderful high school and Harvard or something.'' Even if it
meant he would have gone on to become, say, a lawyer? ``Well,
that's interesting to me,'' he says. ``A criminal lawyer or
constitutional lawyer _ that would be an interesting thing.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's on the subject of alternative lives, Allen says he
could also happily imagine no longer living in his beloved
Manhattan. When he was making plans a few months ago to move out of
his Fifth Avenue apartment, he says, ``I brought up the idea with
my wife of moving to Paris. She thought it would be too radical _
all our friends are here, my editing room, my jazz band. But if she
had said OK, I might have. It's got just about everything New York
has _ noise and crowds, art. It's a big jazz town, big cinema town;
they're nice to me over there. It wasn't a bad thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he shrugs, ``I would have to give up being able to come
home at night and snap on the Knicks game.'' What about cable?
Paris has cable. ``Yeah,'' he allows, ``but if they're playing in
Seattle, there's a real time-zone problem.''

 &HT;    Store data online, at no cost
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you've ever needed to wipe your hard disk
completely clean and didn't have a Zip drive or other offline
storage device for stashing the information, you already know what
a hassle it is to back up all that data onto floppy disks.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a way to get 300 megabytes of storage for free. You
can use it for whatever you like, and the uses are limited to times
when you need to reformat the disk.
</P>
<P>
   This storage is furnished by a Web site, so that means that your
most precious information would remain safe, even if your computer
were destroyed by fire. Businesses have used off-site storage for
years, and the Internet is filled with sites that offer storage.
</P>
<P>
   But this site is different in a couple of ways. You get the 300
megabytes of storage free, and this site is aimed directly at
Macintosh owners. Simply go to the site at FreeMacSpace.com,
register and the space is yours.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the site's organizer had to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual hard drives for the Macintosh community are a perfect
match for Apple's iMac users and for the large community of
designers and artists who use high-end Macs,'' said Ari Freeman,
co-founder and chief strategic officer at FreeDiskSpace.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the iMac, iBook, G3 and G4 computers do not ship with a
floppy drive, our virtual hard drives provide these users with an
easy and free solution to securely store and, if they choose, share
any type of file they wish. Mac-based designers who commonly work
with large files will find storing, sharing and collaboration of
files to be as simple as turning on their computers.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also advertises itself as a place to stash important
files in case the Y2K glitch bites. But as a Macintosh owner, you
are almost certainly safe. Unlike PCs, most Macintoshes are
Y2K-proof. Apple says its recent models are safe until 29940 A.D.,
and chances are you'll need a new Mac by then.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, working antiques like the Apple II may not be so
bulletproof. Some of these machines are still doing honest work. If
you're using one, you may want to back up your information, just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, although you're probably safe from Y2K woes, some of you
may enjoy the New Year more if you've backed up your most important
files and stored them away on this site.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced virtual hard drives _ at separate
sites _ for other systems including PC, Linux and personal digital
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   The site promises good security as far as protecting your
information.

 &HT;    Keep Windows 2000 in mind when buying or upgrading
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While normal people are getting ready for the
holidays, the real geeks and wireheads among us have started
thinking about getting home computers ready for Windows 2000, the
coming edition of Windows that should be released early in the new
year.
</P>
<P>
   I've been using beta copies of 2000 for several months now. It's
not really fair to critique Windows based on test copies, since the
whole idea of a beta test is to find problems and bugs in the
software. But, all in all, it seems as if it will be (and it should
be) better than Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Based on my experience, here are some things that will help you
get ready for Windows 2000 if you're thinking of buying a new
computer or upgrading the one that you have.
</P>
<P>
   Memory: Windows 95 and 98 used memory a lot better than Windows
3.1, but both are still flawed. For technical reasons that would
take too long to explain, some computers running these versions of
Windows actually slowed down after much more than 64 megabytes of
RAM were installed. Windows 2000 is built on the more robust
backbone of Windows NT (the industrial strength version of Windows)
and handles memory a lot better. It also seems to need more memory.
I'd suggest 128 megabytes of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories: Not every accessory that you are now using with
Windows 95 or 98 will work with Windows 2000. That applies even to
brand-new devices. For instance, just weeks ago I got a demo
version of a new game controller that plugs into the joystick port.
It won't work with Windows 2000. A smart buyer would know in
advance, since the package clearly stated that the controller
wasn't compatible with Windows NT (and, as I said, that's the
framework Windows 2000 is built on). So if you're shopping for
accessories, check the package to make sure that they'll work with
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Software: It's the same story here. Not all of your software
will work with Windows 2000. When you install 2000, the program
does a good job of identifying the programs on its list of
incompatible programs.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a tip, though. Many of the programs that 2000 flagged as
incompatible ran just fine, so don't delete those old programs
without actually trying them. And when you buy new software, look
on the package to make sure that it's Windows 2000 compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the important ``gotchas'' to think about. But there
are some other things to keep in mind. These apply to any computer
running Windows.
</P>
<P>
   USB: That stands for universal serial bus port. Windows 98 and
Window 2000 support this technology, and it's a vast improvement
over the way things used to be. It's much easier to install new
equipment on a computer equipped with USB. You simply plug it in,
and it works. You can plug and unplug the device while the computer
is running, without a bunch of rebooting and reconfiguring. I've
literally never had a moment's trouble installing a USB device. You
can be sure that your new computer will have USB ports. I highly
recommend that _ when you're buying a new scanner, printer or other
device _ you get the USB version.
</P>
<P>
   Video cards: Most people don't know what computer gamers have
understood for a long time. A good video card can speed up your
computer at least as much as going to the next-fastest processor
chip. Even if you're not a gamer, make sure the next video card you
buy has at least 16 megabytes of onboard RAM. My own video card has
32 megabytes of RAM and _ even on my now-antique 350-megahertz
Pentium II machine at home _ things fly.
</P>
<P>
   One last thing to keep in mind. Windows 98 will be around for a
while. There is no law that says you have to buy and install
Windows 2000. But, since most of us probably will move to it
someday, it's smart to keep its requirements in mind when you buy a
new computer or upgrade the old one.

WIDE-SCREEN BIOGRAPHY DETAILS JOHN FORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
PRINT THE LEGEND 
The Life and Times of John Ford 
By Scott Eyman. Simon &AMP; Schuster. 
656 pp. Illustrated. $40. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Ford didn't invent the Western. He could barely stay on a
horse (one longtime sidekick earned his wrath by saying Ford looked
like a sack of onions in the saddle). But the tall, lanky,
red-headed Irishman _ born John Martin Feeney in Portland, Maine,
in 1894, and known as Jack from childhood _ went west to become one
of the giants who invented and transformed movies. Before his 30th
birthday, he was mythologizing the West in ways that stretched and
defined the genre and America's way of thinking of the frontier
experience, of itself, and of its relation to the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The title of this admirably thorough biography by Scott Eyman
comes from the last Western Ford made that can be thought of as
great, ``The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'' (1962). In that rueful
meditation on the mythifying process of which Ford was so much a
part, a frontier newspaper editor says, ``This is the West, sir!
When the legend becomes fact, print the legend!'' The monumental
job facing Eyman was separating one from the other. This bountiful
study fills many a gap in previous books, supplying not just
on-the-set anecdotes, but descriptions of the shoot, including
finances. Possibly Eyman was aided by the fact that Ford died in
1973, before Eyman began the book. Ford was as great a storyteller
off-camera as on, and wasn't always the best source of fact about
his own life. We know too much about the last part of Ford's life,
not enough about the early days, and Eyman rights the imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was a closed book for most of his life. He
self-protectively hid his artist's soul behind a rough crust of
meanness. He dominated his sets in often bullying ways. For years,
he belittled two ex-football players turned actors and Ford
regulars _ John Wayne, who took Ford's abuse and became a good
actor, and Ward Bond, who also took it, but was rather more
successful as a McCarthy-era Red-baiter. Yet Ford wasn't always a
tyrant. He didn't say much on his sets, where he would spend a lot
of time chewing on a handkerchief balled up in his fist. But on
more than one occasion when he would see a young actor having
trouble, he'd walk over and murmur the one word that would be the
key to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the answer was to resist his bullying altogether.
Thomas Mitchell, the ex-newspaperman turned actor, once found
himself on the receiving end of Ford's barbs. ``I saw `Mary of
Scotland,' '' Mitchell said, silencing Ford by citing one of his
flops (although it led to a tempestuous relationship with its star,
Katharine Hepburn). Truculence was part of Ford's makeup. So was a
romantic streak. He went West under the shadow of his older
brother, Francis, an actor who employed Jack as a carpenter, stunt
man, editor, assistant director, actor. The Ford brothers were
loyal to each other, but also hard on each other. Once an explosion
on a set put Jack in a hospital for weeks with a broken arm. ``That
was close,'' Frank said. ``Another second and audiences would have
realized I was using a double.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, they underwent reversals of fortune. Frank ended
up playing drunks in Jack's Westerns. Their brother, Eddie, worked
for both of them off-camera. Jack and Eddie had fistfights well
into their 40s. But Jack wouldn't have dreamed of not giving Eddie
work.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was famous for his grudges long before he became famous for
his movies. Eyman does the moviegoing world a service by reminding
us that though Ford seemed to arrive full-blown as the foremost
director of Westerns in 1939 with ``Stagecoach,'' he had begun
making them as early as 1917. His admitted influences were the
best: D. W. Griffith, F. W. Murnau. Once, in the 1940s, someone
marveled at Ford's ability to shoot a Western in eight weeks. ``I
spent 26 years learning how to make a picture in eight weeks,''
Ford growled.
</P>
<P>
   Among his contemporaries, only Howard Hawks rivals Ford's
stature as a director of Westerns, and Hawks made far fewer of
them. Ford's first epic Western was a silent, ``The Iron Horse''
(1924). You can bracket the arc of the Western with two shots of
John Wayne's face _ open, hopeful, and energized in ``Stagecoach''
(1939), twisted by hate and alienated from civilization in ``The
Searchers'' (1956), arguably Ford's greatest Western because it
strips away any hint of bonhomie that sentimentalizes the racist
violence behind the so-called winning of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Critics who feel closer to the iconoclastic thrust of Sam
Peckinpah's ``The Wild Bunch'' than to Ford's output would do well
to reexamine not only ``The Searchers'' but also ``My Darling
Clementine'' (1946). Ford's retelling of the story of Wyatt Earp
and Doc Holliday and the Gunfight at the OK Corral marked the
genre's turning away from heroics toward melancholy introspection,
a quality to be found as well in ``Fort Apache'' (1948) and ``She
Wore a Yellow Ribbon'' (1949).
</P>
<P>
   ``My Darling Clementine'' and ``The Searchers'' seem less a
double-barreled broadside against imperialism than a reaction to
the depleting of American optimism by the horrors of World War II.
Like his contemporaries Frank Capra and George Stevens, Ford found
his worldview darkened by his experience making wartime
documentaries. If the detective story turned into film noir, Ford's
Westerns turned fatalistic. Still, Ford has always been more than a
little misunderstood. Because he has so closely been identified
with Wayne and Wayne's politics, and loved strutting around in his
Navy uniform, Ford has been thought of as a right-wing
propagandist.
</P>
<P>
   Although he embraced Nixon at the end, he voted for Kennedy in
1960, had supported Truman in 1948, and was a big fan of FDR's
progressive politics. In a highly theatrical and totally effective
way, the canny Ford, whose patriotism was beyond question, routed
the Red-baiters who tried to take control of the Directors Guild in
the blacklist days. His Westerns were never about heroic loners
(contrary to the image Wayne was made to stand for, especially
later in his career). They were more about communal energies. In
``Stagecoach,'' Ford clearly sides with the tarnished proles over
the stuffy respectable hypocrites.
</P>
<P>
   His sympathies become clearer in light of the communal values in
his best non-Westerns: ``The Grapes of Wrath'' (1940), ``The Long
Voyage Home'' (1941), ``How Green Was My Valley'' (1942), ``They
Were Expendable'' (1945), even his idealized Irish idyll, ``The
Quiet Man'' (1952). Ford saw films in his head, painting with the
camera, finding and pouncing upon humanizing detail. He began by
making up films as he went along, only later devising scripts, and
only because studio executives demanded them. Colleague after
colleague tells how Ford had whole sections of films in his mind
before shooting even began. As the years went by, his shooting
style became simpler, sparer, until the end, when his energies
flagged and he produced long, slack films like ``The Long Grey
Line'' (1955) and ``Cheyenne Autumn'' (1964).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was most comfortable in mostly male societies heavily
populated by cronies he could boss around. His shoots in Monument
Valley were, psychically speaking, little Western expeditions of
escape and exploration with people he knew and with whom he kept
repeating the experience. Some the public never saw _ like Danny
Borzage, director Frank Borzage's brother, whose job for decades
was to hang around the set playing Ford's favorite songs on the
accordion (a device many silent movie directors used to get the
right mood on set). By the standards of the day, he treated the
Navajos of Monument Valley well. They made him an honorary Navajo,
gave him blankets and keepsakes, which he kept in his bedroom in a
Los Angeles home he often fled to be alone on his yacht, Araner _
his one luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Like many an artist, he was not a sterling family man. Making
films was his thing, not being a husband or father. Even if the
city of Portland hadn't gotten around to erecting a statue of Ford
a few years ago, his place in history would be assured. Given
access to family records and documents, Eyman has diligently sorted
out fact from fiction, including the travails Ford experienced as
an artist trying to make his own films his own way. Today Ford
would thrive as an independent. Had his health and energies held,
he might have done more TV, to which he was ideally suited, given
his background in quickly and cheaply grinding out two- and
three-reelers. Of course, he never would discuss his films or his
methods in terms of art _ only craft, and not much of that. In a
country of immigrants reinventing themselves, Ford sometimes was
his own best creation.

HARBISON'S `GATSBY' A LONGTIME LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Like many people of his generation, John
Harbison read ``The Great Gatsby'' when he was in high school, more
than four decades ago. Unlike some of his classmates, Harbison read
F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel because he wanted to, not because an
English teacher assigned it. ``All of my friends were reading the
book,'' Harbison recalled last week, sitting by the fire in his
kitchen. ``So I read it too. Also my father taught at Princeton,
and the Princeton-Fitzgerald connection was still very strong in
those days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gatsby'' has stayed with Harbison ever since. He has always
wanted to be an opera composer in a world where that is a very
difficult ambition to fulfill, and ``Gatsby'' has always been an
opera he wanted to write. But the rights to adaptations were tied
up by Fitzgerald's literary executors, so Harbison composed two
other operas first, ``Winter's Tale,'' after Shakespeare, and
``Full Moon in March,'' after Yeats. There were a couple of other
operatic projects that didn't come to fruition, though Harbison
continued to compose prolifically for solo and choral voices, as
well as in just about every other genre of music. By 1985, Harbison
had given up on ``Gatsby,'' but he bade an elegant, eloquent, and
engaging farewell to his ambition by putting some of his musical
thoughts about the book into an overture, ``Remembering Gatsby.''
That piece has become one of his greatest hits; even the Boston
Pops has played it.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later Harbison made an ``innocent discovery'' _ he
did the math and discovered that the novel was about to enter
public domain, and his projected opera became a possibility again.
Harbison forged ahead, though two prominent composers serving on a
panel with him told him they had tried to wrestle it onto the
Broadway stage and determined that ``it can't be done.'' Ultimately
the Metropolitan Opera commissioned Harbison's opera to commemorate
the 25th anniversary of the debut of James Levine, and so Levine
will conduct the world premiere of ``The Great Gatsby'' at the Met
on Monday night _ coincidentally Harbison's 61st birthday _ with a
prestigious cast headed by Dawn Upshaw as Daisy, Jerry Hadley as
Gatsby, Susan Graham as Jordan Baker, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson as
Myrtle, Dwayne Croft as Nick, and Mark Baker as Tom Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Harbison composed the score between June 20, 1995, and Dec. 20,
1996, in a variety of venues _ Cambridge; his wife's family's farm
in Wisconsin; Sand Point, Idaho; Martha's Vineyard; Italy. Before
he started composing, he drafted his own libretto. (He found one of
two surviving copies of a once-popular 1926 stage version, but
found it unhelpful.) Harbison's solution to the problem of the
novel's indirection was to put its narrative line onto the stage
and its indirection into the music, which warms up some of
Fitzgerald's unpleasantly hedonistic characters and makes them more
interesting and better company. (Harbison's mother had said to him,
``What do you want to write an opera about so many disagreeable
people for?''). Harbison the composer found Harbison the librettist
``compliant'' in a way that some composers have not found their
librettists, and as he worked, he changed some of the libretto to
follow where the music was leading. ``One amazing thing about the
human voice,'' Harbison says, ``is that it is impossible to be
unsympathetic to someone who is singing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Harbison's important pre-compositional decisions was not
to rely on period pop music to do a lot of the work of creating
atmosphere, which is the route most dramatizations of ``Gatsby''
have taken. Harbison began by writing 13 '20s-style pop songs that
would thread through the score; after struggling with trying to
write period lyrics, he sent six of the songs out to Murray
Horwitz, who knows the turf (the others are heard as instrumental
numbers, for which Horwitz has supplied lyrics not heard in the
opera). The pop songs contain within them the motives and harmonies
of the rest of the score, so that Harbison could ``glide in and out
of them, seamlessly,'' coming up, he hopes, with a new solution to
an age-old dilemma of how to integrate songs and arias into
theatrical exposition. ``Mozart solved this problem, and so did the
Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers pictures. The songs in `Gatsby,' I hope,
will help some people find their way into the opera; more analytic
members of the audience will recognize how the same music runs
throughout. Every era has to dicker with the recognition of what
`melody' is.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbison certainly knows the musical turf as well as Horwitz
knows the lyrics of the period. His father was a dance-band leader,
and he says he wrote ``Remembering Gatsby'' as an opportunity to
see his father tuxed up again. He himself started playing in a
Dixieland band at 11, and the music of Louis Armstrong, Wild Bill
Davis, and Max Kaminsky is something he has known his whole life.
What he didn't know as well was the music of the social milieu of
``Gatsby,'' so he put himself through a course of Bix Beiderbecke
and Paul Whiteman in order to reproduce some of the characteristic
sounds of the period. He's grateful to some historically informed
jazzmen in the Met orchestra who have improved on his own knowledge
_ he had scored for high-hat cymbals, for example, but a player
told him that they hadn't been invented by the early '20s, and the
player showed him how '20s musicians created what sounds like
high-hat work on period recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The soprano sax is heard in the ``Gatsby'' orchestra, and so is
the banjo; there is also an ``ahuugah'' horn of a Stutz Bearcat in
the music, and a couple of wandering stage bands, which during the
party scenes create layers of texture like the ones in the finales
of Mozart's ``Don Giovanni.''
</P>
<P>
   As Harbison worked, casting fell into place. Dawn Upshaw was in
from the beginning; the others came later, and by the time Harbison
was composing the second act, everyone was in place. ``It was very
good to have images of the performers, aural and visual, as I
worked. I found myself expanding the character of the working-class
Myrtle, who is a kind of downscale Gatsby, filled with the same
kinds of inchoate longings. I tried to give her a different class
of music, and with a wide range of emotions in it. You don't have
Lorraine in mind without thinking of a wide range of emotion. Mark
Baker I saw as the Drum Major in `Wozzeck,' the best I ever saw,
and so that may have entered into my thinking. The Met saw Gatsby
as a baritone, a specific baritone, but I always thought of him as
a lyric tenor, with Tom as a heavy, Wagner kind of tenor.''
</P>
<P>
   One fringe benefit that came to Harbison was to attend many Met
performances as he composed. ``I saw all the standard pieces like
`Aida,' `Carmen,' and `Butterfly,' and I kept going back to pieces
I love, like `Eugen Onegin.' And I went to all the 20th-century
operas the company was doing _ `Wozzeck,' `Moses und Aron,' `A
Midsummer Night's Dream,' and `Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk.' This I
found very useful, particularly hearing how different sizes of
voices projected over different kinds of orchestration in the large
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, there was a reading of two scenes at Emmanuel
Music, where Harbison serves as principal guest conductor; later
there were readings of other scenes by students at Aspen under the
direction of David Zinman. Harbison found these readings immensely
helpful, and he made some changes as a result; at the request of
the Met technical staff, he rewrote an orchestral interlude because
they told him the scene change the interlude was covering was
impossible without additional music.
</P>
<P>
   Once the opera was out of his hands and into those of the Met,
Harbison found himself delighted, sometimes bewildered, sometimes
amazed. Opera on the Met scale is a complex mechanism involving
hundreds of people and many individual efforts that do not coalesce
until the last moment _ Harbison says he sometimes felt like the
proverbial blind man with his hand on the hide of an elephant.
``Some pieces you know, but you have to figure out how they fit
with others that you don't know. It is absolutely amazing how any
opera ever gets put on; a tremendous number of people have to
function at a very high level.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbison is full of praise for the direction of Mark Lamos, who
directed the world premiere of ``Winter's Tale'' in San Francisco
in 1970; for the efforts of the cast; for the design team _ he
shows you Jane Greenwood's spectacular costume designs with as much
pleasure as if he had drawn them himself. And being Harbison, he
has found something to learn in every part of the experience. (``I
didn't understand that if a set design looks terrific, you're
probably in trouble; the set has to work together with the
costumes.'')
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Harbison is full of admiration for Levine. ``His
theory of conducting is unique in the present day, I think; he
wants the orchestra and the music to come to him. He transfers a
lot of the responsibility for interpretation to the players, so he
looks like a throwback to the era of Pierre Monteux, Bruno Walter,
Fritz Reiner, or George Szell. It is all centered in what he is
doing, with such tremendous economy and authority _ totally
different from so much conducting today which cries `wolf' so many
times that it wears out its authority. In rehearsal, he will
sometimes let things swim for a while, so that the players can
learn with their ears why and how it happened; the final result is
playing of the highest standard. The players are not peons but
participants in the performance. Their mandate is to offer detail;
his is to stay calm and out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, ``Gatsby'' is already securely in the composer's
past _ the premiere comes exactly three years after he put down the
last note. He has since written a major work for the Chicago
Symphony, and he is working on a concerto for orchestra for the
Minnesota Orchestra; an orchestra/choral work for the Boston
Symphony; and some chamber-music projects, including a song cycle
on poems by Elizabeth Bishop and a piece for flute and strings for
Randolph Bowman, the former Boston freelancer and principal flute
of the Cincinnati Symphony whose performance of Harbison's flute
concerto blew the composer away.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he hopes the Met audience will take out of the
theater with them, Harbison says, ``I hope people will be haunted
by some aspect of it _ the way I am haunted by other operas I have
seen. What you see in a opera is very preoccupying, but you also
carry out of the theater a sense of musical space, and the rhythm
of the piece, its musical and psychological content. This is an
opera about yearning and longing, like `Tristan und Isolde,' or
`Eugen Onegin,' from the feminine side _ but yearning of a
particularly American kind. Opera haunts people more than concert
music does; that's because purely musical impressions are mingled
with other kinds of experience.''

JORDAN TAKES A GAMBLE WITH GRAHAM GREENE'S `AFFAIR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it was published, in 1951, Graham Greene's ``The End of the
Affair'' was hailed by such literary luminaries as William
Faulkner, who anointed the book ``one of the most true and moving
novels of my time,'' and Evelyn Waugh, who considered the novel
``singularly moving and beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Jordan has always considered ``The End of the Affair,'' a
book he first discovered as a young man in his native Ireland,
``one of the most frank and moving books about a love affair that
I've ever read.'' But Jordan, the writer-director of such films as
``Mona Lisa,'' ``The Crying Game,'' and ``Michael Collins,'' also
believes the book is ``very plotty,'' and its conclusion
``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone once said that story is where the characters do what
they want to do, and plot is where the characters do what the
author wants them to do,'' said Jordan, over a recent breakfast at
a Boston hotel. ``And the book seemed to me very plotty. I thought
the author was very intrusive, especially at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   So in his adaptation, Jordan resolved to make bold changes that
would, in his words, ``let the characters breathe. The changes I've
made, I think, make the story more real and more poignant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair,'' which opens Christmas Day, stars
Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore, and Stephen Rea. As the film begins
it is 1946, and Bendrix (Fiennes) is still tied in knots over the
abrupt end of his affair with Sarah (Moore, resurrecting the
British accent that served her so well in ``An Ideal Husband'') two
years before. Without explanation, Sarah suddenly walked away from
Bendrix, vowing to see him no more. She returns to life with her
husband, Henry (Rea, appearing in his eighth Jordan film), a kind,
but achingly dull civil servant. A chance meeting between Bendrix
and Henry pushes Bendrix to discover why he was unceremoniously
dumped by Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   It is a love story, yes, but it is also a deeply spiritual tale
about the profound sacrifice one may be willing to make for someone
he or she loves. ``The End of the Affair'' is considered Greene's
most autobiographical novel; it was based, in part, on his own
affair with a married woman.
</P>
<P>
   When he read the novel again five years ago, Jordan immediately
thought ``it would make a lovely movie,'' he said. There was
already a film version, a poorly received 1955 adaptation that
starred Deborah Kerr as Sarah, the decidedly un-British Van Johnson
as Bendrix, and Peter Cushing as Henry. Greene is said to have
hated the film, directed by Edward Dmytryk; Jordan took his own
look shortly before beginning his version.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very good,'' he said in his soft Irish accent. ``It's
just one of those very pedestrian adaptations they made in the '40
and '50s. They made (Bendrix) American so it didn't make sense at
all. And they couldn't show any of the sexuality, so you couldn't
really tell what was going on. The social context was lost, and
that was confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   That Dmytryk film, Jordan said, became a heavy-handed morality
tale undermining the sensuality of Greene's love story. He wanted
to restore those emotions, and highlight the book's central event _
a bombing during the Blitz that marks a dramatic moment for both
lovers, but especially for Sarah, who makes a desperate deal with
God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it important that this event be seen from many
different angles,'' Jordan said. ``I thought it could be filmed to
show the actual meanings of these particular events in these
people's lives. I think it's a timeless story. The dilemma Sarah is
put in is a terribly human one, and one I could understand now.''
</P>
<P>
   What didn't work for Jordan was the novel's later chapters, and
that is where his film differs most markedly from the novel. The
death of a major character, which occurs about two-thirds of the
way through the book, comes near the conclusion of Jordan's
adaptation. That structural change, Jordan maintained, does right
by Greene's characters in a way that perhaps the author himself
could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe'' some of the events in the book, said
Jordan, who was himself a novelist before he became a filmmaker.
``Greene's a bit like Thomas Hardy in that he tends to manipulate
his characters toward the positions he wants them to hold. You can
feel him pushing the characters in those directions. So I tried to
allow the stories and the characters to breathe a little bit more,
allow them to exist, and allow the ideas to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graham Greene was a really messed-up British Catholic, and I
wanted to make the explanations far more ambiguous,'' he said. ``In
the end, I didn't want to explain whatever was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   If Greene purists are disturbed by the liberties Jordan has
taken _ and they likely will be _ the director is undaunted. He's
been down this path before, having stared down bloodthirsty Anne
Rice devotees when he cast Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat in his
1994 ``Interview with the Vampire.'' Rice herself was among the
most vocal, complaining that Cruise ``is no more my vampire Lestat
than Edward G. Robinson is Rhett Butler.'' (She later praised the
finished film, which went on to earn more than $100 million.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unprepared for that because I didn't know the enormous
reputation the book had in America,'' said Jordan, recalling the
barrage of criticism he endured while adapting Rice's novel. ``But
we had a clear mind about what we wanted to do,'' he said, ``and I
suppose in a strange way all the public fuss about it drew us
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Jordan, Greene has been dead for eight years _
not that Jordan believes the writer would have necessarily
objected. As for disgruntled fans, Jordan said, ``I think it's
their problem, I honestly do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an incredibly powerful story, and Greene became
overwhelmed by ideas. That's one of the reasons I wanted to make
the movie,'' he said. ``I thought his philosophical concerns were
destroying the very beautiful human story he told.''
</P>
<P>
   At 49, Jordan has had a varied, see-saw career. There have been
highs such as ``Mona Lisa'' and ``The Crying Game,'' for which his
original screenplay won an Academy Award in 1993; and lows such as
``We're No Angels,'' which managed to make both Robert De Niro and
Sean Penn look bad, and ``In Dreams,'' a godawful psychological
thriller starring Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr. earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even sure I should be making films in the United
States,'' he said with a laugh, admitting his American films have
tended to be his least successful. ``I can make `Mona Lisa' in
England, and understand the context; I can make (``The End of the
Affair'') in Britain, and understand the context. Obviously, I can
make any Irish movie because I know the characters,'' said Jordan,
who lives in Ireland. ``But over here, I just don't know, say, how
a father and daughter in Massachusetts would instinctively relate
to each other. I don't know all that stuff people just breathe over
here. So it's probably better for European directors like me to
make European films, although that doesn't mean I won't be offered
American films.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he still wants to make films in America, he's happy to
steer clear of the noisy, megabudgeted action films Hollywood's
most famous for these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``'I don't think, unless you're Jim Cameron or Steven Spielberg,
those big huge movies really belong to the director,'' he said.
``Besides, I'm sure there are people who can do those much better
than I can.''

OLD-FASHIONED LOVE STORY OF SCARLET LETTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
FORTUNE'S ROCKS 
By Anita Shreve. 
Little, Brown. 453 pp. $24.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Otempora, o mores! Back in the days of carriages and
shirtwaists, when men were men and women were girls, physical
passion was not a force one unleashed lightly. Surrendering to it
outside the strictures of society's blessings could ruin your life,
particularly if you were a young woman of a particular class who
was supposed to marry well. But desire still lurked among the
shoals, as we know from the opening lines of Anita Shreve's
full-frontal novel. The first paragraph of ``Fortune's Rocks''
contains the words ``licks,'' ``pink,'' ``naked,'' and ``shudder,''
and that's just the description of a girl walking barefoot in the
sand.
</P>
<P>
   So you get the sense fairly quickly that this will not be a
novel of ideas; in fact, ``Fortune's Rocks'' is a bodice-ripper
with a mission. For all its sultry attention to the breathtakingly
doomed romance between a 15-year-old girl and a man nearly three
times her age, it also borrows from the conventions of Dreiser,
Dickens, and Hawthorne, both in its overtones about oppressive
morality and in its revelations about the haves and have-nots. With
its token bow to ``Sister Carrie'' and ``The Scarlet Letter,'' this
is a big, old-fashioned novel with its heart in the right place,
even if its sensibility lies somewhere between heavy breathing and
a heavy hand.
</P>
<P>
   I devoured it shamelessly, despite initial misgivings (that
opening paragraph) and making snippy margin comments. Certainly
Shreve is beloved by readers for earlier works, especially ``The
Pilot's Wife'' and ``The Weight of Water,'' and this story contains
the same combination of narrative scope and tension that has served
her in the past. But it is the unalloyed character of Shreve's
young protagonist, Olympia Biddeford, that gives the story its
staying power. Following her heart into dangerously deep waters,
she will spend most of her life trying to rectify her early
impulsiveness. Still, Olympia is no ninny and even turns out to be
a lousy martyr. She has good sense, and the emotional posture of a
woman who knows how to care for herself, whether out of
self-respect or sheer instinct for survival. And the little world
that has witnessed her downfall seems hellbent on robbing her of
both.
</P>
<P>
   The only child of a well-heeled Beacon Hill literary editor,
Phillip Biddeford, and his neurasthenic wife, Rosamund, Olympia has
accompanied her parents as they flee the Boston heat for their
house in the summer community at Fortune's Rocks, on the New
Hampshire seashore. It is 1899, and Olympia is under the tutelage
of her father, an intellectual and progressive whose love for the
girl is revealed through rigorous instruction. One day he gives her
a collection of essays by a physician who runs a clinic in the
nearby mill town of Ely Falls; the fellow is coming to visit,
Biddeford counsels his daughter, so she might as well familiarize
herself with his work. This is the first Olympia has heard of John
Haskell, who is 41, with a wife and four children. By the time the
two are finished shaking hands a few days later, destiny and
longing is written all over them both.
</P>
<P>
   So: She's a girl on the verge of becoming a woman, beautiful and
smart and already accustomed to admiring older men. He's on the
verge of life's mid-afternoon, but he's also swimmingly masculine,
passionate about caring for the poor, and has a close-focus
charisma that, to a 15-year-old, must be as blinding as the sun.
There are a few noble attempts to keep their desire at bay _ she
accompanies him to attend a breech birth; he insists during
emotional moments that this connection is all they can ever have _
but within a few weeks they are wildly in love, or in something.
Much running up and down the beach for Olympia, who lies to her
father and then takes flight for the hotel where Haskell awaits
her. Much hand-wringing for Haskell, who knows better, flings
himself between torment and lust, then risks everything anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This cannot last, of course, and the scandal, when it becomes
public, is devastating. Poised in that hinterland between want and
wisdom, Olympia foresees what lies ahead _ ``that she has forfeited
her future'' _ just before the bough breaks. Disgraced, Haskell
loses his family as well as his practice. Olympia, having torn her
father's heart out, returns to the Biddeford home in Boston, where
the following spring she will have a son, taken from her in the
first moments of life. Banished to a female seminary in Western
Massachusetts, Olympia could well go on to live a life of piety and
mourning, but some semblance of core strength propels her toward
another course of action.
</P>
<P>
   And all this in the first half of the novel! Relying upon a few
aged but sturdy conventions _ desire under the elms, tragedy,
penance, redemption _ Shreve has written a period piece of a
certain predictability, but she has tried to imbue it with moral
authenticity, and that effort mostly succeeds. Her worst error
regarding the doomed lovers concerns Olympia's continual insistence
that she hasn't been seduced _ a protestation that at first seems
lead-footed, then shrill (on Shreve's part, not her character's),
and does little to redeem Haskell in the reader's eyes. The only
feat which accomplishes that is his own suffering; as with
Hawthorne's Arthur Dimmesdale, his measure of nobility is hardly a
match for the likes of Hester Prynne.
</P>
<P>
   And this Hester, too, will have her day. I was surprised to care
as much for Olympia Biddeford as I came to through the course of
her sodden story: not for her blunders and sorrows, which are those
any girl could claim, but for her mercy _ her strength and kindness
in the face of despair. Shreve has woven fine and elaborate cloth
around her heroine, giving the 19th-century communities of
Fortune's Rocks and Ely Falls historical accuracy as well as
evocative detail. Her attention to the opposing social milieus of
the summer rich and the mill workers, a tension that will figure in
Olympia's plight, has done her story a world of good, opening it up
beyond a romance cum morality tale to greater narrative sweep. She
can be an impatient writer _ tidying up a disaster, she might go
from rubble to repair in a couple of sentences _ but her gifts as a
storyteller have to do with a kind of prime-time realism. Having
set up that dependable formula of windswept heartbreak in the dunes
(O mores! O moors!), she knows precisely when to cut and when to
fade.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   !! ``American Movie'' Chris Smith's documentary about a
desperate amateur filmmaker in Wisconsin trying to will a grade-Z
horror movie into being. At first, it seems like campy Americana,
but then it veers uncomfortably into geek-show territory. (R) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   !!! ``Anna and the King'' This handsome, intelligent retelling
of the story of the British teacher who aided the King of Siam's
policy of education and enlightenment in the 1860s is inevitably
old-fashioned, despite a few tweakings for the sake of political
correctness. But it's more than carried by the character in Jodie
Foster's Anna and Chow Yun-Fat's progressive king. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Bicentennial Man'' Robin Williams goes the touchy-feely
route again, this time as a sensitive robot who prospers, acquires
some reprogramming, and falls for the granddaughter of the family
that bought him, thinking he was no more than a snazzy household
appliance. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BS)!! 1/2 ``The Cider House Rules'' The best film yet of a John
Irving novel. It's built around the surrogate father/surrogate son
relationship between Michael Caine's saintly orphanage doc and
Tobey Maguire's innocent, which lasts even after the boy departs to
taste of the tree of knowledge (via a job on an apple farm) in the
1940s. Lasse Halstrom bolsters the rich characters with sensitive
and lyrical direction. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Ride with the Devil'' Ang Lee's historical romance reminds us
that the Civil War was fought with particular savagery in Kansas
and Missouri, where pro-slavery planters and abolitionists were
neighbors. But most of the film focuses on the lulls between the
bloody outbreaks, and on how the loosely organized Confederate
forces known as Bushwhackers survived. Intelligent and absorbing,
it requires patience, but repays it with nuanced performances from
Tobey Maguire, Skeet Ulrich, Jeffrey Wright, and Jewel. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Stuart Little'' Serviceable rather than magical, this
retelling of E. B. White's classic story of a spunky mouse who
refuses to think small has warm performances, the most up-to-date
computer-generated mouse Hollywood can buy, and a scene-stealing
Noo Yawk voice from Nathan Lane as the Little family's resentful
cat. But it never charms us out of an awareness that we're watching
a manufactured object. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``The War Zone'' Tim Roth's first outing as a director is a
harrowingly courageous film about incest in a claustrophobic
British family in Devon. In its uncompromising choice of subject
matter and its go-for-broke (yet never falsely sensationalized)
execution, it's an extraordinary piece of work. Lara Belmont makes
an unforgettable acting debut as a troubled teenager. (Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
! 1/2 ``Where's Marlowe?'' Not here. This lame effort can't make up
its mind whether it wants to spoof private eye noirs or independent
filmmaking cliches. It fails at both as it takes the ungainly form
of a mockumentary about a couple of filmmakers who find themselves
bailing out a struggling LA detective agency headed by Mel Ferrer's
gumshoe hooked on Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe. (R)

WHAT UNDERLIES A MAN'S FEAR OF SHOPPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lingerie is very much in the mainstream these days, so you might
think it would be easy for a man to walk up to the counter and buy
a wonderful gift for the woman in his life. But it's not. Many men
are still embarrassed to approach the lingerie department. And when
they do manage to work up the nerve, they have no idea what they're
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Marnie McLaughlin, public relations manager for the Victoria's
Secret chain, says lingerie-related anxiety is so common among
males that her company has even considered setting up a call-in
help line, sort of a Butterball Turkey Talk-Line for men who need
help buying gifts of underwear for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pride ourselves on training our staff to be very helpful,''
McLaughlin said. ``No man should ever be embarrassed to be in our
store.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many men are reluctant to walk though the door.
``I've observed that it's not age-related,'' McLaughlin said.
``It's older men, younger men, all ages. It has to do with the
intimate nature of lingerie. And they're embarrassed because they
don't understand women's sizes.''
</P>
<P>
   Who does, for that matter? Women's sizes are often bewildering
to women, too. One manufacturer's size 8 is another's size 12. It's
too much to ask a man to try to fathom these mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Reibel, spokesperson for Filene's, says many men who shop
for lingerie don't have a clue what size they're looking for. ``The
salesperson will ask, `Is she small, medium, or large?' '' says
Reibel, ``and the man will say, `She's about your size,' no matter
how big the salesperson is.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin advises the male lingerie buyer to shop armed with a
size. Ask her. Ask one of her friends. Look in her closet. Most
clothes have size tags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can work with a dress size _ or a pants size _ and usually
arrive at the right lingerie size,'' McLaughlin says.
</P>
<P>
   Reibel offers a diplomatic suggestion. ``When in doubt, buy a
smaller size. She'll be flattered, even if she has to return it for
something larger.''
</P>
<P>
   Most men love sexy underwear, and most women love to wear it.
Unfortunately, men often buy lingerie with only their own fantasies
in mind, which can lead to problems, if her fantasies don't jibe
with his. ``She's looking for a cotton nightgown and he gives her a
marabou-trimmed teddy,'' Reibel says. ``One customer brought back
some baby dolls her husband had given her. She mistook the matching
thong for a hair scrunchie.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin advises taking note of what a woman wears and buying
her something in the same vein, but nicer. ``If she wears pajamas,
get her silk pajamas, something she wouldn't buy herself,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tastes vary, of course,'' Reibel says, ``but it's hard to go
wrong with something elegant, luxe, in silk or cashmere or
velvet.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to buying lingerie for women, men forget the
comfort factor, says transgender comedian Tammy Two Tone, a.k.a.
Doug Moulter. Two Tone, who lives in Chicopee, Mass., has an
interesting perspective on the subject. He's a lifestyle
transvestite, a heterosexual man who chooses to dress as a woman at
all times. He's married. He and his wife are expecting their first
child in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men see sexy things in a catalog, but they don't realize''
that the garments are uncomfortable, he says. ``Men should have to
wear some of this stuff for a day and see what it feels like.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Tone, an old hand at buying lingerie for himself and for his
wife, offers this advice: ``Get her a gift certificate. Then make
an evening of it. Take her to dinner. Go to the store, pick out
something nice, then go home and have fun with it.''

DISAPPOINTED COUPLE WANT REFUND ON RING BOUGHT IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a stop in Cozumel on a Caribbean cruise last month, Michael
and Nancy Greco paid $2,400 for a tanzanite and diamond ring that
their Mexican jeweler appraised at $6,530.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tremendous bargain, and normally the type of savings
that would make the couple from southeastern Massachusetts wonder
whether something was amiss. But the Grecos had been reassured by
representatives of their cruise line, Celebrity Cruises, a division
of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., that everything was on the up and
up.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Grecos say cruise line representatives gave a
lecture before the ship docked at the island off Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula, telling guests that they would be able to buy jewelry
for far less than in the United States and receive a guarantee of
quality and value as long as they shopped at specific stores. The
guarantee was contingent on an appraisal by an independent
gemologist within 30 days of the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we went there,'' said Nancy Greco, referring to the
jeweler Rachat &AMP; Romero. ``We wouldn't just go to anybody,
particularly in Mexico. The cruise line went out of its way to say
how great they were.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Grecos returned from their cruise, Michael Greco had
the ring appraised, but discovered that finding a gemologist with
no ties to any store was not so easy. But he kept searching, and
eventually had the ring appraised for a fee of $100 by Arthur
DeMello Jr. of National Gemological Laboratories in New Bedford,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   When the appraisal arrived in the mail, the Grecos were shocked.
The ring that Rachat &AMP; Romero had appraised at $6,530 was appraised
by DeMello for $1,900, a difference of $4,630. DeMello told us
appraisals are not a ``black and white science, there's always a
gray area. But the gray area doesn't overlap from $2,000 to
$6,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the Grecos' jewelry bargain began to look a lot like a
scam. The Grecos said that instead of paying far less than they
would have paid in the United States, they paid more.
</P>
<P>
   Antoinette Matlins, a gem and jewelry specialist from South
Woodstock, Vt., who has written a number of jewelry buying guides
for consumers, said she could not vouch for the accuracy of the
Grecos' appraisal. But she said jewelry fraud is rampant abroad,
and she described cruise ship passengers as lambs being herded to
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stores are taking advantage of the fact that people are
looking for bargains,'' Matlins said. ``Everyone wants a memento of
their trip and, for women, jewelry is one of the favorite
mementos.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the cruise line's guarantee, she said it was the first
she had ever heard of it. ``But it's an easy promise to make since
most people, quite frankly, don't bother to check out anything when
they get home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Jakeway, a Celebrity Cruises spokeswoman, said the in-port
shopping program is handled by a subcontractor called Onboard
Media. Hugh Treadwell, a vice president with Onboard, said that
participating retailers agree to repair or replace any
unsatisfactory item. ``It's not a price guarantee, and it's not a
guarantee of future value,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Rachat &AMP; Romero, the Cozumel jeweler, officials described the
Grecos' complaint as a ``misunderstanding.'' The store's customer
service manager, Leslie Pubols, said the jeweler does a ``huge
business'' with cruise line passengers and insisted such problems
are rare.
</P>
<P>
   She said the appraised price that the Grecos received from
Rachat &AMP; Romero was more like a suggested retail price, even though
it was identified as an appraised price on a document entitled
``certified appraisal.''
</P>
<P>
   To clear up the misunderstanding, Pubols originally offered
Michael Greco $400, then raised the offer to $500, the difference
between his $1,900 appraisal and the $2,400 he paid. When he
demanded more, she offered to reimburse the entire $2,400 if he
returned the ring to Rachat &AMP; Romero's Florida supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Matlins said full reimbursement is customary when a dispute
about the value of jewelry arises. Treadwell called the jeweler's
offer ``extremely diplomatic'' and not required by the guarantee.
He said he would have asked for a second appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   But Greco said that agreeing to a refund would be letting the
cruise line and the jeweler off too easily. ``They're basically
saying, `You caught us at fraud so what we'll do is give you your
money back.' I think that stinks. How many other people are they
ripping off?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Greco said the $2,400 he paid for the ring was 37 percent of the
Rachat &AMP; Romero appraised price. He said he would be satisfied if
he paid 37 percent of the $1,900 appraisal, which would mean Rachat
&AMP; Romero or the cruise line would have to refund him $1,697. He
also wants them to pay the $100 cost of his appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides currently are at a standoff. Pubols has refused to
offer anything more than a refund, and Greco, who paid for the ring
with a credit card, is disputing the charge and refusing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   --Wrong year on personal checks. As the 2,000th year approaches,
a reader said she is puzzled about how to fill out the dates on her
personal checks, all of which are preprinted with the year 19--.
Should she cross out the first two digits and write in 2000? That
indeed is the answer to this millennium issue, but it is not worth
fretting over. Robert Fichter, spokesman for the Massachusetts
Bankers Association, said the official date is the one stamped by
the bank, not the one scribbled by the check-writer. He said people
ought to be more worried about possible Y2K scams, such as
strangers, posing as government or banking officials, calling up
and asking for bank account or credit card information.

HOW THE LAUGHTER NEVER STOPPED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By P. CLEMENT HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not an auspicious start to the Christmas vacation in my
senior year so long ago. Fifty years to be exact, but the memories
have burned into my soul.
</P>
<P>
   I had just come home for a two-week stay. The family was there.
Everyone, including Mac, the cat. It should have been wonderful,
except I ruined the first day by prowling around the house wringing
my hands and just not sitting still.
</P>
<P>
   I was a nervous wreck, due mainly to an out-of-control
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated, Ma asked, ``What is the matter with you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' I replied, resuming my pacing.
</P>
<P>
   Ma didn't take kindly to that lame excuse, so she asked again,
using as strong a language as she ever did: ``What in heaven's name
is the matter with you? You're driving us all nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm in trouble,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God, he's got some girl pregnant,'' Ma said, as big sis
and big bro looked on, all ears and giggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I wailed. ``Worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then out with it,'' Ma yelled as her voice cracked. That
usually happened when she yelled at me. Frequently.
</P>
<P>
   So word by word, misery by misery, the story was wrenched from
my miserable body. It gets better, too, because as I groaned out
the story, my brother laughed so hard he nearly fell down, laughing
even more as the story became more and more ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   My big brother loved to tell the story in later years, but
never, never finished it because he got laughing; you know, the
tears rolling down his face and sheer inability to go on.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, this didn't bother me, maybe because the more I told
the story and the more my siblings laughed (even Ma had a giggle or
two, although as the lady she was she tried not to laugh), the more
I realized how dumb the story was and I had nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   But not at the time. It has to do with a chicken, or half a
chicken. It could have been a turkey, but I was the turkey, a
Christmas turkey.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great lunch, a roasted half-chicken that my girl's
folks gave me to take home and enjoy. I did just that, took it back
to my rooming house and enjoyed it.
</P>
<P>
   There is a rule at the rooming house that no food is allowed in
rooms. I broke that rule, then wondered how to get rid of the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, as the eaten carcass got riper and riper, I
had to do something. So, one cold midnight, I went out of the
house, ready to toss the carcass on the unvirsity coal pile next
door. Just a quick walk, a short toss, and I was home free.
</P>
<P>
   But then, I was caught in the act, in the headlights of the
hated campus cops.
</P>
<P>
   The cops didn't say, ``Hold it right there!'' They didn't have
to; I was still holding that ripe chicken carcass in its cardboard
box.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing?'' one of the cops asked. ``Just taking the
air,'' said I (it was freezing).
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh huh,'' said the cop. ``What have you there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My lunch,'' said I, getting in deeper and deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see it,'' said the cop, taking a whiff as I handed it to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not lunch,'' said the cop, handing it back, gingerly.
</P>
<P>
   To the rescue of his partner with the puckered up nose, the
other cop asked, ``So what were you doing out here at midnight with
a rotten chicken?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had lunch at my friend Paul's house where we were studying,
and it got late and I just wanted to get home,'' I said, as visions
of prison cells danced in my head.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem, and the reason I was so worried, is that I
mentioned my friend Paul's last name, and was afraid the cops would
check with Paul and find that everything I said was a lie.
</P>
<P>
   And that is when my siblings had to leave the room because they
were laughing so hard.
</P>
<P>
   After this everything got blurry. I know the cops let me go and
I got back to my cozy bed, where, as in Dylan Thomas's ``A Child's
Christmas in Wales'' I said few words to the holy darkness and
slept.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, nothing ever came of the incident, and I was
able to relax for the rest of the vacation. I will never forget the
story, but I don't remember what happened to the chicken.
</P>
<P>
   And my brother never stopped laughing. Not at me, but with me.
</P>
<P>
   His death last month at the age of 78 stopped the laughter, but
I, with the love that only a brother can give and receive, will
never stop smiling.
</P>
<P>
   You might wonder about that strange twist to the handyman's
byline. It is my real name, put there in honor of Clement C.
Moore's ``A Visit from St. Nicholas.'' It's appropriate, too, since
my big brother's name is Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   And, amid the laughter and tears, we wish everyone a happy
holiday, and many more, and a handy (of course) new year.
</P>
<P>
   Exit laughing.
</P>

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Dec. 21:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ANCIENT-FLOWERS (Undated) _ A trove of fossils in
Sayreville, N.J., reveals what plant life was like when dinosaurs
roamed New Jersey. Researchers say the findings are turning
botanical lore on its head, by revealing that the great
diversification of flowering plants, the most species-rich and
important group of plants on earth, took place at least 90 million
years ago, some 30 million years earlier than previously suspected.
By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (1250 words)

</P>
<P>
   SCI-BREAST-CANCER (Undated) _ Seeking to better understand the
origins of breast cancer, researchers have begun to look as far
back as the womb to identify prenatal factors and childhood
experiences, including birth weight, diet and exercise patterns,
that may affect a woman's risk of developing breast cancer. By Jane
E. Brody. (1900 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NUKE-LABS (Undated) _ The indictment of Dr. Wen Ho Lee has
cast a pall over scientists and others in and around Los Alamos.
And some foreign scientists, whose expertise is needed, are staying
away from the lab. By William J. Broad. (1900 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PLANT-DNA (Undated) _ Biologists have decoded a large part
of the DNA of a plant, affording the first glimpse of the genetic
programming of the plant world. The plant, known formally as
Arabidopsis thaliana and informally as ``the weed,'' is studied by
nearly a thousand laboratories around the world as a model plant.
By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GOULD-NATURE (Undated) _ A conversation With Stephen Jay
Gould, the noted evolutionary biologist, who gives his views on
creationists and the movement, neo-Darwinism and the joys of
writing. By Claudia Dreifus. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: items on eyes
of the giant squid, atomics clocks and eclipses, and haze over
China. By Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FULL-MOON (Undated) _ High tides, not cosmic levels of
illumination, may be the most noticeable effect tomorrow night when
an unusual combination of celestial events will produce one of the
largest and brightest full moons in recent memory. By Robert A.
Saar. (400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BETHLEHEM-STAR (Undated) _ The Star of Bethlehem has been
called many things by many people: a comet, a conjunction of
planets, a supernova, a miracle, a myth. With just one biblical
account, in the book of Matthew, of the star and how it caused the
wise men to come to Judea in search of the newborn Jesus, exactly
what it was, if indeed it was anything at all, remains an open
question. That question has attracted yet another answer, one that
is gaining attention from historians of astronomy for its unique
approach. Dr. Michael R. Molnar, an astronomer and physicist and
former teacher at Rutgers University, proposes that the star was
the planet Jupiter, seen in the constellation Aries, the ram. By
Henry Fountain. (850 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EYE-CANCER (Undated) _ Terry Hoddinot, 36, has been blind
since the age of 3. His son, Riley, 3{, lost his left eye a month
ago. And the same rare eye cancer, retinoblastoma, was diagnosed in
his baby daughter, Katie, while she was still in the womb. But
doctors say there is a good chance that they may have saved Katie's
vision with a bold new procedure: delivering her prematurely, then
treating the affected eye before the cancer had a chance to grow
and blind her. The approach has important implications for the
treatment of retinoblastoma, a potentially fatal genetic disorder
that afflicts 1 in 20,000 North Americans. By Mark Bloom. (1100
words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BARBIE-ENVIRON (Undated) _ Barbie is about to become
environmentally correct. Her creator, Mattel Inc., the world's
largest toy maker, announced last week that its most popular doll
would henceforth be made with organic, biodegradable materials
instead of the petroleum-based polyvinyl chloride, which has been
linked to an assortment of environmental and health problems.
Environmental and consumer groups say the announcement marks a
significant break with industry practice. But it only partly
quieted an angry controversy that surrounds a host of plastic toys.
By Holcomb B. Noble. (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-COLUMN (Undated) _ Personal Health: Lurking in the
guts of many pets and people is a sneaky parasite that may well be
the most common cause of gastrointestinal distress in this and many
other countries. The organism, a protozoan called giardia, is easy
to acquire but hard to diagnose and often difficult to treat
effectively. It can cause no symptoms at all or it can turn its
host into one sick puppy suffering from abdominal cramps, diarrhea
and weight loss. It may even result in food allergies. By Jane E.
Brody. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-YOGA-FITNESS (Undated) _ The Novice: Learning to do Bikram
yoga, less formally known as hot yoga and conducted in rooms heated
to 100 degrees. The heat enhances flexibility. By Vicky Lowry.
(1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CONTACT-LENSES (Undated) _ Buying contact lenses has never
been easier. Besides the traditional outlets, like optometrists'
offices and mail order stores, they can be found on hundreds of Web
sites and even at beauty salons and local flea markets. But now
authorities are cracking down on those sold without prescriptions.
By Susan Gilbert. (860 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ A newly redesigned Web site aims to make cancer survival
easier for the growing number of Americans who are being
successfully treated for it. (210 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Canadian researchers report that after studying a variety of
alcoholic beverages, they found that the martini scored highest for
its antioxidant properties, which researchers believe may help the
body fight everything from cancer to cataracts. (320 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Gay men are almost twice as likely to smoke cigarettes as men
over all, a new study finds. The study was done by researchers at
the University of California at San Francisco, and looked at 2,600
men who described themselves as gay or bisexual. About 48 percent
reported smoking, compared with about 27 percent of all American
men. (200 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Perhaps the only thing more frustrating for diabetes experts
than the number of patients who lose their vision is that in many
cases, the problem could be prevented with relatively basic eye
examinations. (290 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Some elderly people who are given diagnoses of voice or speech
disorders may simply be showing ordinary signs of aging, scientists
say. (200 words)

IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR A COZY MILLENNIUM BASH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you're not going to Las Vegas and dropping big bucks to party
with people you don't know ... not going to New York to see the
ball drop in Times Square ... not dancing till dawn buoyed by
rivers of the finest champagne.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean you're stuck solo on New Year's Eve with a
frozen pizza and a bottle of $3 wanna-be champagne, either.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late to plan an elegant, intimate gathering to
welcome in 2000. All it takes is a bit of organization, a
willingness to be flexible and a bunch of compatible people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have realized that this is a once-in-a-lifetime
event, and rather than spend it with a bunch of strangers at a big
party, they're looking for something more personal, a time of quiet
reflection with friends,'' said Bob Klingensmith of Chatsworth, at
a Canoga park liquor store. He was picking up a few bottles of
Irish whiskey he'll share with friends on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Party planners suggest you first decide whether you'll have a
sit-down dinner, a wander-around buffet or a casual, grab-a-bite
evening around the TV. The kind of party you choose will suggest
the size of your guest list: Dozens may be able to mingle through
your small apartment with chips full of dip, but your dining table
can just seat so many.
</P>
<P>
   Don't have enough glasses or chairs, and your china is old
Melmac from the thrift store? Although the best of the rental
merchandise has already been spoken for, it's not too late to look
into renting even the basic necessities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of wonderful things available in rental today,
things that are like the finest heirloom china and the finest
crystal,'' said Joann Roth-Oseary, president of Someone's in the
Kitchen catering in Tarzana.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can make do with what you have, using the most mundane
materials to make your party setting sparkle, said
party-planner-to-the-stars Colin Cowie, who has operations in Los
Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   A bedsheet or a shawl can be a tablecloth, and lighting bunches
of inexpensive votive candles can provide a romantic setting.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent dinner he threw for friends, he had big pieces of
mirrored glass cut to fit a long, narrow table for a sit-down
dinner. As a centerpiece, he used ball-shaped white candles set
into a meandering river of snowy rock salt; when lit, the candles
shimmered and the tabletop reflected the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very simple to do and it didn't cost a lot,'' Cowie
said. ``Money has nothing to do with style, or with having a great
party. A formula for a good party is a great guest list, a
well-stocked bar, a delicious dinner and wonderful music. You can't
go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowie suggests a cold seafood buffet and bottles of bubbly for a
group if you've got a healthy bank balance, or a pot of stew and
pitchers of martinis if your cash isn't flowing quite as freely as
you'd like. Or maybe it's time to whip up a pot of your special
chili or a big pan of lasagna.
</P>
<P>
   Don't cook? Ask each of your guests to bring a dish to share. Or
check out the deli and takeout sections of your supermarkets; most
offer party trays of cold cuts and cheeses and even entire holiday
meals, if you order in advance. And some caterers, even though
they're busy organizing big New Year's Eve bashes, will cook extra
for your small party. Just be prepared to pick up the food yourself
on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could serve an all-desserts buffet, with your guests
awash in a sea of chocolate and whipped cream, either homemade or
purchased. But do desserts go with champagne, the traditional drink
as the calendar rolls over to next year?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing goes better with champagne than more champagne, or
maybe some strawberries or raspberries,'' said Dan Whittemore,
owner with wife Linda of Dandy Don's Ice Cream Sundae Bar catering
in Van Nuys. ``If you have a $30 bottle of champagne, you don't
want anything to interfere with the delight of the champagne.''
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to buy champagne, better buy it soon, advises David
Breitstein, owner of the Duke of Bourbon in Canoga Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not running out yet,'' he said. ``But there's definitely
more of a demand for champagnes and sparkling wines now than at any
time in history. But, you know, you don't have to buy the most
expensive champagne. You just have to share it with someone special
to you.'' &QL;

<P>
   Maybe champagne and caviar aren't your speed, and you'd rather
usher the old year out surrounded by your family in a quiet
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   For this very special New Year's Eve, Susan V. Bosak, author of
``Something to Remember Me By'' (The Communication Project;
$15.95), a storybook about keepsakes a grandmother gives her
granddaughter, has several suggestions for family get-togethers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a family scrapbook party, choosing favorite photos and
decorating themed pages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Read favorite stories out loud, tying stories to personal
memories and bringing them alive with old mementos like your
grandfather's watch or your grandmother's earrings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a ``best memory'' party, with each person telling their
favorite memories of other family members.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a millennium time capsule to be stored and opened in five
years.
</P>
<P>

CASES TO HIGHLIGHT BUSH'S DEATH PENALTY ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush is proud to call himself ``the
law-and-order governor.'' And rightly so. In five years in office,
he has overseen the executions of 113 death row inmates, more than
any other governor in any state since the death penalty was
reinstated in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But the relentless efficiency of his state's death row machinery
is about to intersect, vividly, with Bush's pursuit of his party's
presidential nomination. In the five weeks before the Iowa and New
Hampshire presidential contests, Texas is scheduled to execute
eight more people, among them convicts whose cases put the debate
about the death penalty into high relief.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the eight committed their crimes as juveniles. One claims
to have been convicted on the basis of a faulty DNA test. One is a
paranoid schizophrenic whose condition went untreated _ until he
killed.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Johnny Paul Penry.
</P>
<P>
   Even supporters of capital punishment have been troubled by the
Penry case. There is no excusing his heinous crime: In 1979, while
on parole for a previous rape conviction, he broke into the home of
Pamela Carpenter, raped her, and then stabbed her to death with the
scissors she was using to make a Halloween costume for her niece.
</P>
<P>
   But Penry has the intellectual capacity of a 7-year-old. He
never got past the first grade and spent his childhood years in and
out of mental institutions. Court records describe how his mother
beat him as a baby and dipped him in scalding water. She forced him
to eat his bodily wastes, according to those records.
</P>
<P>
   Penry's execution is sure to gain national attention, for it was
in his case in 1989 that the US Supreme Court issued a
controversial ruling that the death penalty for retarded
individuals is not a constitutionally prohibited ``cruel and
unusual punishment.'' He is scheduled to die by lethal injection on
Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not spoken publicly about the Penry case and, in
keeping with his normal practice, he would not examine the facts of
the case until the date set for execution. Bush has never granted
such a reprieve. And it was the governor's opposition last spring
that led to the scuttling of a bill that passed one house of the
Texas Legislature. It would have banned executions of the mentally
retarded.
</P>
<P>
   The case of another Texas convict, Larry Robison, who has been
diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, poses another issue: whether
the mentally ill should be executed. In a bloody rampage, Robison
slaughtered two men, two women, and an 11-year-old boy near Fort
Worth in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Before he launched his murderous spree by decapitating and
sexually mutilating his male housemate, Robison had no history of
violence. His illness had been diagnosed when he was 21, but he was
turned away from treatment because he lacked health insurance. He
has requested Jan. 21 as an execution date, because he wants to die
on a night of a full moon.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled executions of Glen McGinnis (Jan. 25) and Anzel
Jones (Jan. 26) and David Hicks (Jan. 20) offer other windows onto
the death penalty and how determinedly Texas and Bush enforce it.
McGinnis and Jones were both juveniles, 17 years old, when they
committed their brutal crimes. Hicks, meanwhile, claims that faulty
DNA analysis helped convict him of a crime he did not commit _ the
rape and murder of his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty has not yet emerged as a campaign issue in a
nation where roughly two of three voters, and three of four
Republicans, endorse the practice. Here in Texas, the most
prominent victims' rights organization speaks for many when giving
Bush its whole-hearted support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has been a very receptive and reasonable
governor when it comes to issues of crime and criminal justice,''
said Dianne Clements, president of Justice for All, the
Houston-based victims group. ``There is poll after poll that proves
the citizens of Texas support the death penalty, the ultimate
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clements defends the use of the death penalty, even in those
cases where the offender was 17 at the time of the crime, or
mentally disabled. ``If they are competent to be convicted, then so
be it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But death penalty opponents contend that Bush's record-setting
embrace of capital punishment may yet be a negative factor for him
in the 2000 election. He shows a callousness, they say, toward the
solemn issues that arise from government's ultimate power: taking
the life of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the overall support given to capital punishment in the
polls, ``the realization is growing that the death penalty, like a
lot of other things that government does, has serious problems,''
said Stephen Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human
Rights in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``People reasonably expect that the governor of Texas ought to
be concerned about executing the mentally retarded, or those who
had poor legal representation,'' said Bright. ``If you are going to
be executing those who were children when they committed the crime,
or people who are mentally ill, the governor ought to at least be
engaged. You don't get the sense that Bush is engaged at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush reinforced such doubts when, in a magazine interview last
summer, he mocked the eleventh-hour plea for mercy by a convicted
double murderer, Karla Faye Tucker, imitating her by whimpering
``Please, don't kill me'' with pursed lips.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, whose born-again faith and repentance for her crimes was
cited in requests for mercy made to Bush by such figures as Pope
John Paul II and televangelist Pat Robertson, was the first woman
to be executed by the state of Texas since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   And in a recent case that spurred headlines across the country,
Texas authorities used an airplane and a team of medical attendants
to fly David Long from the intensive care ward of a Galveston
hospital to the death chamber in Huntsville on Dec. 8 so he could
be executed on his appointed date. He had tried to commit suicide
by taking an overdose of anti-psychotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting him on life support and flying him out of the hospital
so they can kill him? People are asking, `What the hell are they
doing down there?' '' said George Kendall, who heads the NAACP's
death penalty project in New York. ``There is a growing volume of
cases in Texas that make it sound like however the system is
supposed to work, this is not it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the well-publicized releases of dozens of death
row inmates found innocent by DNA testing has sparked a national
movement for a moratorium on capital punishment, and led to a
slight downtick in support for the practice in public opinion
polls, foes of the death penalty hope to use the upcoming primary
season to publicize their cause and pressure Bush to intervene on
behalf of those scheduled to die.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's legislative record raises further issues. Despite
repeated judicial criticism of the way that Texas provides legal
services to indigent defendants in capital punishment and other
criminal cases _ via a court-appointed patronage system _ Bush
vetoed a bill that would have reformed the system and established
an independent public defender's office this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter on the death penalty in his campaign autobiography,
Bush says that he treats his ``profound'' responsibility in capital
punishment cases ``thoughtfully and carefully,'' but that he limits
his decisions on whether to intervene to two matters: ``Is there
any doubt about this individual's guilt or innocence? And, have the
courts had ample opportunity to review all the legal issues in this
case?''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of political philosophy, Bush says, he does not
believe he has the right to ``replace the verdict of a jury with my
own'' in order to show mercy, or for potentially mitigating factors
like age, mental illness, or mental retardation.

DISAPPOINTED COUPLE WANT REFUND ON RING BOUGHT IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a stop in Cozumel on a Caribbean cruise last month, Michael
and Nancy Greco paid $2,400 for a tanzanite and diamond ring that
their Mexican jeweler appraised at $6,530.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tremendous bargain, and normally the type of savings
that would make the couple from southeastern Massachusetts wonder
whether something was amiss. But the Grecos had been reassured by
representatives of their cruise line, Celebrity Cruises, a division
of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., that everything was on the up and
up.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Grecos say cruise line representatives gave a
lecture before the ship docked at the island off Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula, telling guests that they would be able to buy jewelry
for far less than in the United States and receive a guarantee of
quality and value as long as they shopped at specific stores. The
guarantee was contingent on an appraisal by an independent
gemologist within 30 days of the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we went there,'' said Nancy Greco, referring to the
jeweler Rachat &AMP; Romero. ``We wouldn't just go to anybody,
particularly in Mexico. The cruise line went out of its way to say
how great they were.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Grecos returned from their cruise, Michael Greco had
the ring appraised, but discovered that finding a gemologist with
no ties to any store was not so easy. But he kept searching, and
eventually had the ring appraised for a fee of $100 by Arthur
DeMello Jr. of National Gemological Laboratories in New Bedford,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   When the appraisal arrived in the mail, the Grecos were shocked.
The ring that Rachat &AMP; Romero had appraised at $6,530 was appraised
by DeMello for $1,900, a difference of $4,630. DeMello told us
appraisals are not a ``black and white science, there's always a
gray area. But the gray area doesn't overlap from $2,000 to
$6,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the Grecos' jewelry bargain began to look a lot like a
scam. The Grecos said that instead of paying far less than they
would have paid in the United States, they paid more.
</P>
<P>
   Antoinette Matlins, a gem and jewelry specialist from South
Woodstock, Vt., who has written a number of jewelry buying guides
for consumers, said she could not vouch for the accuracy of the
Grecos' appraisal. But she said jewelry fraud is rampant abroad,
and she described cruise ship passengers as lambs being herded to
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stores are taking advantage of the fact that people are
looking for bargains,'' Matlins said. ``Everyone wants a memento of
their trip and, for women, jewelry is one of the favorite
mementos.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the cruise line's guarantee, she said it was the first
she had ever heard of it. ``But it's an easy promise to make since
most people, quite frankly, don't bother to check out anything when
they get home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Jakeway, a Celebrity Cruises spokeswoman, said the in-port
shopping program is handled by a subcontractor called Onboard
Media. Hugh Treadwell, a vice president with Onboard, said that
participating retailers agree to repair or replace any
unsatisfactory item. ``It's not a price guarantee, and it's not a
guarantee of future value,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Rachat &AMP; Romero, the Cozumel jeweler, officials described the
Grecos' complaint as a ``misunderstanding.'' The store's customer
service manager, Leslie Pubols, said the jeweler does a ``huge
business'' with cruise line passengers and insisted such problems
are rare.
</P>
<P>
   She said the appraised price that the Grecos received from
Rachat &AMP; Romero was more like a suggested retail price, even though
it was identified as an appraised price on a document entitled
``certified appraisal.''
</P>
<P>
   To clear up the misunderstanding, Pubols originally offered
Michael Greco $400, then raised the offer to $500, the difference
between his $1,900 appraisal and the $2,400 he paid. When he
demanded more, she offered to reimburse the entire $2,400 if he
returned the ring to Rachat &AMP; Romero's Florida supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Matlins said full reimbursement is customary when a dispute
about the value of jewelry arises. Treadwell called the jeweler's
offer ``extremely diplomatic'' and not required by the guarantee.
He said he would have asked for a second appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   But Greco said that agreeing to a refund would be letting the
cruise line and the jeweler off too easily. ``They're basically
saying, `You caught us at fraud so what we'll do is give you your
money back.' I think that stinks. How many other people are they
ripping off?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Greco said the $2,400 he paid for the ring was 37 percent of the
Rachat &AMP; Romero appraised price. He said he would be satisfied if
he paid 37 percent of the $1,900 appraisal, which would mean Rachat
&AMP; Romero or the cruise line would have to refund him $1,697. He
also wants them to pay the $100 cost of his appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides currently are at a standoff. Pubols has refused to
offer anything more than a refund, and Greco, who paid for the ring
with a credit card, is disputing the charge and refusing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   --Wrong year on personal checks. As the 2,000th year approaches,
a reader said she is puzzled about how to fill out the dates on her
personal checks, all of which are preprinted with the year 19--.
Should she cross out the first two digits and write in 2000? That
indeed is the answer to this millennium issue, but it is not worth
fretting over. Robert Fichter, spokesman for the Massachusetts
Bankers Association, said the official date is the one stamped by
the bank, not the one scribbled by the check-writer. He said people
ought to be more worried about possible Y2K scams, such as
strangers, posing as government or banking officials, calling up
and asking for bank account or credit card information.

 AUSTIN, Texas: ... mental retardation.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I support the death penalty because I believe, if administered
swiftly and justly, capital punishment is a deterrent against
future violence and will save other innocent lives,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, as governor, is the only candidate who has to concern
himself with particular death penalty cases, but he is far from
alone in his general views. All five of his Republican adversaries
support the death penalty, as do Vice President Al Gore and former
Senator Bill Bradley, the two men squaring off in the Democratic
primaries. Bush's Democratic opponents in the last two
gubernatorial elections each sought to show that they were tough on
crime by enthusiastically endorsing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is strong support for capital punishment in Texas,''
said Tony Fabelo, who as director of the Texas Criminal Justice
Policy Council serves as the Texas governor's top adviser on
criminal justice issues. And Fabelo said Bush is no one-trick pony,
and should be credited for the way that his reform of the juvenile
justice system and his ambitious prison construction program have
helped cut the Texas crime rate and modernize its institutions.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP pollster, William McInturff, who conducts public opinion
surveys for the campaign of Senator John McCain of Arizona, said
the governor risks little damage in approving the executions in
January. The electorate's general position on capital punishment,
said McInturff, is akin to that of one voter who told the pollster,
``I'll tell you where I stand on the death penalty: right next to
the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting how President Clinton showed he was tough on crime during
the 1992 campaign by approving the execution of Rickey Ray Rector,
a mentally retarded Arkansas man, McInturff said that the only
political risk when applying the death penalty is ``that you don't
want to appear you are being glib with that responsibility.'' And
after the fallout over his comments about the Tucker case,
McInturff said, ``I'm sure governor Bush is most attuned to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Texas has a system of government that curbs the
governor's power, Bush can technically give a death row inmate just
a 30-day reprieve from execution. But he appoints the Texas Board
of Pardons and Paroles, which has the authority to grant clemency
requests and commute sentences and has never varied from Bush's
position on the 113 executions and one act of clemency during his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has the authority, though he has never had to use it, to
overrule an act of clemency by the board. ``My appointees . . .
reflect my no-nonsense approach to crime and punishment,'' Bush
said. In the single case of clemency, Bush and the board agreed
with the Texas attorney general that crazed serial killer Henry Lee
Lucas had made a phony confession to the 1979 rape and strangling
of an unidentified woman for which he was sentence to death.
</P>
<P>
   The probation and parole board holds no public hearings, votes
by phone or fax, and does not explain its reasoning. The secretive
and casual nature with which the board makes decisions spurred one
federal judge last year to call it ``appalling'' and ``incredible''
and an ``extremely poor'' process.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Texas system of having elected judges appoint
their favorite lawyers for impoverished defendants was called a
``farce'' and a ``travesty'' by another federal judge after a
series of abuses _ including defense lawyers who slept in court or
abused cocaine _ came to light last year. The problem was
exacerbated when the federal government cut off all funds to
resource centers that provided help to death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush publicly defended the state's clemency and indigent defense
systems. He vetoed the bill to create a new public defender's
office, and without his support the proposed legislation to reform
the clemency process died in this year's legislature, along with
the bill to ban executions of the mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the tangential ways Bush helps create an
atmosphere,'' said Maurie A. Levin, an Austin lawyer who represents
death row inmates. ``To me, killing a retarded guy and a juvenile
in the same month when you are running for national election says a
lot about you.''

GIZMOS, GAMES HIGLIGHT THE SEASON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(David Bloom's weekly Digital L.A. column on the intersection of
technology and entertainment.) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As you stock up on computers, video game consoles and DVD
players this digital Christmas, you'll need something to actually
play on your new gizmos. Here are some last-minute arrivals worth
your attention.
</P>
<P>
   Some titles are available on more than one platform, and are so
noted with the following abbreviations: PlayStation (PSX), Nintendo
64 (N64), Sega Dreamcast (DC), Windows-based computer (PC), Apple
Macintosh computer (Mac), Game Boy/Game Boy Color (GB). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DVDs &QC;
</P>
<P>
   I concentrate here on some recent animation and fantasy titles
that may work for both little ones and grownups. As with most DVDs,
these titles often have lots of extras beyond the film itself.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is issuing its first nine DVD titles, starting with
``Pinocchio.'' You also may find ``The Wizard of Oz'' in a
resplendent digital reissue. But for more out-of-the-way goodies,
try these:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nuttiest Nutcracker'' is a fabulous-looking 3-D computer
animation based loosely on ''The Nutcracker'' story line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' was a box-office bust but critical fave with
its Atomic Age in-jokes, deft combination of classic and computer
animation and story of a boy and his giant robot. Warner Bros. has
loaded the disc with other features.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wall'' is Pink Floyd's Orwellian movie/album, completely
remastered for 5.1-channel surround-sound and high-definition
video. Throw in a second documentary and much else and you have a
showpiece.
</P>
<P>
   For a quick tour of English animation highlights of the past
three decades, start with ``Yellow Submarine,'' reissued in
glorious fluorescent colors with all that gorgeous Beatles music
sounding better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   You can see the movie's influences stretched beyond 1969 with
``Monty Python's And Now for Something Completely Different,''
which is laden with fun from the loony British comedy troupe that
gave us John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin and Terry
Gilliam.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, over the past decade or so, the great Nick Parks has
been crafting a series of much-loved, stop-motion clay animation
shorts about a wide-mouthed Brit and his eyebrow-arching dog. The
``Wallace and Gromit'' disc contains three of these wonderful
stories, along with some other odds and ends about Parks' career. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sports games &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Basketball season is well under way, with some decent titles on
every platform. One of my favorites is Midway's NBA Showtime: NBA
on NBC (DC, PSX, N64). It's the roundball equivalent of the
company's over-the-top NFL Blitz. Anything short of physical
assault is legal, with plenty of fun moves and dunks possible. This
is a great game on the Dreamcast and N64 because four people can
play in the two-on-two game.
</P>
<P>
   For more extreme winter sports, try Sled Storm (PSX), a somewhat
unlikely but fun snowmobile-racing game, or Cool Boarders 4 (PSX),
the latest in a line of great snowboarding titles. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Looking back &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For your clan's nostalgic gamers, I'd suggest several revived
classics mined from 1980s-era arcades and given a heavily revamped,
3-D version as well as their ``classic'' modes. They aren't all
worth the treatment, but I liked the revived Centipede game (PSX,
DC), the Next Tetris (PSX, N64) and Space Invaders (GBC, PSX).
Blessedly, Pac Man and Ms. Pac Man are also back, as part of the
Namco Museum Collection. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Multi-platform &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Rayman 2: The Great Escape (N64, PC) The limbless hero hops to
N64 with a great new adventure that's a blast to play for any age,
and looks even better on PC, in one of the better games of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Toy Story 2 (PC, N64, PSX) comes from the same people who made
last year's ``Bug's Life'' title so fun. Buzz Lightyear makes his
way through a series of buildings, much as in the hugely successful
film, to rescue Woody and others. A nice adventure for anyone 8 or
so and up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PlayStation &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage is the sequel to last year's breakout
adventure hit, Spyro the Dragon, and every bit as much fun. Younger
children will love it, but so will more grown-up ones.
</P>
<P>
   Crash Team Racing is also a sequel of sorts, with Crash
Bandicoot now driving. I don't like it as much as Hot Wheels Turbo
Racing (also on N64), but both are good. But if you want a real
racing experience, look for Gran Turismo 2, the massive sequel to
the best driving simulator ever.
</P>
<P>
   For more mayhem in your driving, look for Twisted Metal 3 and
Vigilante 8: Second Offense (also DC), or the truly politically
incorrect Grand Theft Auto 2. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nintendo 64 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo's secret weapon is Rare and other in-house studios,
which are responsible for both Donkey Kong 64 and Jet Force Gemini.
</P>
<P>
   DK64 is the latest from one of Nintendo's signature franchises,
and is a colorful, complex and fun title. But it's a bit too
challenging for players younger than 8 or so.
</P>
<P>
   Jet Force Gemini is also for older gamers, a space adventure
that involves killing a lot of big, well-armed ant creatures and
rescuing ewok-like villagers. There's a two-person cooperative
mode, a four-player battle mode, and an excellent story line. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dreamcast &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The new guy has already sold more than 1 million machines in
less than three months, in part because of great titles such as NFL
2K and NBA 2K. I also love the Sega Bass Fishing game, which is
ridiculously addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Soul Fighter is another handsome entry in Dreamcast's seemingly
inexhaustible array of fighting games, though Soul Calibur remains
the champ. And in the racing genre, Sega Rally Championship is a
near-perfect arcade transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Toy Commander, which lets you direct toys against each other, is
a fun alternative to the Toy Story 2 universe, while Rippin' Riders
and Trick Style should sate the family extreme sportster. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PC &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Quake III Arena is the ultimate blast-fest but relies largely on
tournament modes instead of what made the first two Quakes go. It
looks fabulous, plays wonderfully but is strictly for
testosterone-ridden older gamers (on Mac too).
</P>
<P>
   Amerzone is a handsome, Myst-like adventure, with you playing a
journalist trying to return mystical white eggs to a Central
American tribe. Good for gamers who prefer a slower ride.
</P>
<P>
   Panzer General 3-D Assault is a turn-based-strategy game set on
World War II's Western Front, with nifty 3-D graphics for units and
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Command &AMP; Conquer Tiberian Sun nicely extends the real-time
strategy genre its predecessor started, with much better graphics,
fun new units and cool terrain effects.
</P>
<P>
   Lego Friends is a great game for youngsters of both sexes. You
help an all-female music group create multiple tracks of music, tie
it to backdrops and lighting, then watch the group perform. Highly
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver and Shadowman are somewhat similar
horror adventures that will have you working this world and the
afterlife to clean out the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   Mob Rule is a very funny, very politically incorrect take on the
SimCity genre. Build up your gang of criminals through graft,
corruption and other unsavory tactics. For a more upstanding pair
of simulations, try out Roller Coaster Tycoon or Sim Theme Park,
both of which let you build and run your Disneyland-like
operations. Tycoon is the more detailed one, but cartoonish Sim
Theme Park even comes with a camcorder view to let you see
firsthand what a ride looks like. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gear &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'd suggest a couple of computer accessories from
Saitek, whose nifty little $20 joystick, the ST-110, makes a great
stocking stuffer. You can also try its more expensive _ and
endlessly configurable _ cousin, the Cyborg 2000.
</P>
<P>
   I also like the Pool Shark, which lets you play virtual pool
games using a real cuestick. It even comes with a pool cue and a
game, Ultimate 8 Ball. &QL;

JACOB DISPLACES MICHAEL AS THE NAME FOR BABY BOYS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Michael, the king of baby names for 45 years,
has been deposed.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob became the most popular baby name among boys in 1999,
according to Social Security records compiled by the San
Francisco-based BabyCenter.com, and Internet baby resource
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The top girl's name for the year was Emily, popular throughout
the decade. Last year's favorite, Kaitlyn, might have been a fad,
because it plummeted to seventh place on this year's top 10 list.
Other favored girls names after Emily were Sarah, Brianna,
Samantha, Hailey and Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   Following Jacob and Michael this year were Matthew, Nicholas,
Christopher and Joshua, Babycenter announced Monday. The Internet
company provides information, support and products for parents.
</P>
<P>
   Names that have climbed onto the top 100 list as 2000 approaches
include Austin, Isaiah and Jack for boys; Emma, Cloe and Sophia for
girls. As technology brings the world closer, expect Americans to
look overseas for names, and even more traditional last names to be
used as first names _ Riley, Taylor, Morgan, Tyler and Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   How was Michael squeezed out?
</P>
<P>
   Baby name specialist Cleveland Evans of Bellevue University in
Omaha, Neb., said society ushered out the popular ``J'' names of
the '80s _ Justin, Joshua, Jason, Jeremy _ but still liked the
sounds of them. In Jacob, a classical biblical name, they found a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There finally comes a point where something new comes up and
people don't realize it's so popular, so it can sneak in,'' said
Evans, a psychology professor who studies fads and fashions in
names.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob has plenty going for it, as names go. BabyCenter.com says
a survey of 22,000 parents found that half call their children by a
nickname _ Jacob's would be Jake. And Evans said names with long
``a'' vowels are popular lately, for boys and girls. Some examples:
Haley, Bailey and Caitlin.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think society is entering a new century of
enlightenment, consider this: one-third of parents said they picked
boys names based on whether they would look good on resumes and
bring success.
</P>
<P>
   But with baby girls, parents are more likely to take a chance
that a name winds up being a fad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (parents) don't project her as much into the future,''
Evans said. Therefore, cuteness and youth often prevail _ names
like Christy, Brianna or Ashley, which was the No. 1 girl's name of
the decade, according to BabyCenter.
</P>
<P>
   So are baby girls taken less seriously?
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is psychological and part of it is biological,''
Evans said. ``Women are supposed to be young. Young is good for
women. It's good for men, but it's not a requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Names, he said, tell more about parents than children.
</P>
<P>
   Upper middle-class families from old money like antiques,
classical music and also like names traditionally applied to the
upper-crust, such as Emma, Henry and Eleanor. But blue-collar
families say the past has not been all that good for them, Evans
said, and they want to focus on emerging names. Hence, Cheyenne and
Dakota.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael, a Catholic name, wasn't used much in colonial New
England because Protestants thought it sacrilegious to name a child
after an angel. But Michael, and other Catholic names like Patrick
and Christopher, later gained popularity, especially with Irish
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, people began naming children after adored stars,
such as Gary for Gary Cooper and Gregory after Gregory Peck.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Deborah Kerr and Debbie Reynolds, some variation of
the names gained ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who wanted the girls perky or sophisticated, the
name got hit from both sides,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Not every star was copied. Few followed Warren Beatty, whose
name was commonly associated with older men, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And few name their son after Brad Pitt because Brad is already
too common.
</P>
<P>
   But Evans said the same year Pitt's movie ``Legends of the
Fall'' (in which Pitt plays a character named Tristan) came out,
there ``were little Tristans all over the place.'' Ditto for Dylan
and Brandon in Beverly Hills 90210.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said parents should think about the values their baby's
name is expressing and then decide if those are the values they
want to reflect.
</P>
<P>
   BabyCenter.com found that 90 percent of parents in their survey
picked a name before the baby was born, and that their primary goal
was to pick a unique name.
</P>
<P>
   And for those of you about to give birth and planning to come up
with a common name with an uncommon spelling, please think again,
Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That drives me up the wall,'' he said, pointing out the
popular Caley is now Kaylee, Kaley, Kayleigh and Kaylie, and goes
on ``ad nauseum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's counterproductive. The kid isn't going to have any
advantages. They're going to go through their whole life spelling
it for people,'' he said. ``And people won't think it's creative.
They'll think the parents were illiterate.''

THE BEASTLY BIAS OF BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a structured discussion about banks last summer
in a politically hip place called Iowa, a dozen or so Republicans
were asked which animal banks reminded them of.
</P>
<P>
   The answers opened a window on an issue that never goes away _
the way credit is dispensed in a society that needs it to grow and
prosper, and the continuing, strong public perception that this
crucial dispension remains rooted in unfairness and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The perceptions both mirror and clash with changing realities,
notes John Taylor, the Massachusetts activist who heads the
National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which coordinates the
activities of those battling for a level playing field.
</P>
<P>
   But down deep, adds the Boston-Washington commuter, ``The
American public believes that race and gender bias exist in the
banking industry, and in fact that is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the animals.
</P>
<P>
   Said two women in the Iowa discussion group, banks are lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think lions tend to think of themselves as king of the
jungle, controller of all,'' one said. ``I think when you generally
deal with a bank, that's a lot of times the feeling that you get.
And then again, the intimidation thing, the charges that we have no
control over, kind of like the smaller animal being eaten by that
lion.''
</P>
<P>
   Another GOP voter, male, picked an elephant: ``They're just very
big and don't pay attention to the smaller ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion or focus group (one of four the coalition held
around the country this year, including in equally pivotal
Manchester, N.H.) was part of a national study of public attitudes
toward banks that also included a polls of 800 voters, with
additional surveys of 200 African-Americans and 200 Hispanics. The
study was bipartisan, coordinated by Republican pollster Frank
Luntz and Democratic consultant Jennifer Laszlo, and consistently
revealing.
</P>
<P>
   The general public attitudes of intimidation and mistrust were
complemented in the polling results. Remember, they come just two
years after a federal study found blacks twice as likely as whites
to be turned down for loans without regard to income, with similar
research showing patterns of discrimination toward other minorities
and women. Some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   --Some 15 percent said they themselves or someone they know has
been discriminated against in applying for a loan.
</P>
<P>
   --Among blacks, the number was nearly twice that, or roughly
one-third. Of those who had personal or second-hand experiences to
relate, two-thirds said it was race, and not gender or income or
credit history, that was the cause.
</P>
<P>
   --73 percent of the whites said they had never been turned down,
almost a 20-point difference from Hispanics (52 percent) and blacks
(58 percent).
</P>
<P>
   --And by 5-1, white males were believed to have an absolute
advantage in the bank loan system. When asked if a white man and a
minority with the same credit history apply for a home mortgage or
small business loan, roughly half overall said they believe the
white male would be favored, while reverse discrimination believers
did not get outside of single digits. Needless to say, the results
were much more pronounced among minorities.
</P>
<P>
   --The poll also disclosed equally strong perceptions about
gender discrimination. Among whites, for example, voters by 60-8
percent believe that with two loan applications at issue, the male
would be more likely to get the dough. Elements of these
perceptions could also be found in attitudes about single-parent as
opposed to two-parent families.
</P>
<P>
   As a man in a Texas focus group put it, ``We really tend to look
at men as business people and women as cooks.''
</P>
<P>
   John Taylor's remark that a lot of these perceptions are at
variance with reality is instructive here. Ticking some of them
off, he noted that a person with a job has got huge odds in his or
her favor of getting credit. It's also true that the working poor
now have statistically documented, excellent track records in
making their loan payments; indeed, some in the industry believe
that good payment records vary inversely with income.
</P>
<P>
   It is further the case that the credit industry has been and is
changing rapidly for the better. There is much more sophistication
about loan products, about the potential of low-income people and
neighborhoods. And the smart institutions are becoming
astonishingly aggressive in their outreach.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still discrimination, a lot of it. Taylor believes
its roots are to be found in the same perceptions among lenders
that afflict the rest of the society _ the idea that there is
something negative associated with nonwhites, with women on their
own, with the foreign-born.
</P>
<P>
   At the national level, the recent rewrite of the banking laws
included a lease on life for the basic law in this area, the
Community Reinvestment Act. But the new law will also relax that
data collection requirements that have given responsible activists
like the NCRC the ammunition to demand change.
</P>
<P>
   The study released last week reminds us all that the battle
against discrimination and bigotry never ends, because the
conditions that breed it survive. It is encouraging and troubling
at the same time, and food for activism as well as thought.

VISUAL ARTS: DEFINING THE LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a long-running show in London's West End, ``The Complete
Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged),'' which squeezes all the
Bard's plays into 97 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the equivalent condensation of 20th-century visual arts.
In the beginning, Paris ruled. Impressionism had paved the way for
other groundbreaking movements. Picasso and Matisse, titans who
remain unsurpassed in the century's painting, emerged, along with
Cubism and Fauvism.
</P>
<P>
   Europe retained a shaky sort of supremacy during and after World
War I, inventing Dada and Surrealism to deal with the unreality of
life. But the next conflagration left that life a complete
shambles. After World War II, the capital of the art world moved
from Paris to New York; some of Europe's leading avant-garde
artists had already made the leap. By 1950, Greenwich Village had
become what Montmartre had been half a century before. Abstract
Expressionism, Pop, and other modes were born and bought, the lag
time between the two steadily shortening, until, in the craziness
of the '80s, millionaires were putting themselves on waiting lists
for paintings by recent art-school grads.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last couple of decades, the notions that the art world
has a single capital and that art is based on a neat succession of
styles have faded. Diversity _ in geography, in media, and in just
about everything else _ is held up as the new god.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us up to now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Art is unavoidable
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of alternative histories, of course. (That's
what keeps the art book business booming.) Another way to look at
20th-century art is through the sheer proliferation of images. In
centuries past, you could avoid art. All you had to do, if you were
an average person without a private collection, was stay out of
museums and churches and away from the fancier areas of town where
you'd be confronted with sculpture in parks and plazas, and you'd
be safe.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, that changed. Endlessly reproduced, art is
now unavoidable. Monet and King Tut turn up on tea towels and on
the sides of buses, advertising the blockbuster shows that, like
the image glut, represent one of the radical shifts of the
20th-century art world. Mass market imagery goes beyond reproducing
masterpieces, though. Posters, billboards, and magazine ads became
as visually innovative as ``high'' art in the 20th century, and the
distinction between ``high'' and ``low'' has been worn down almost
to the point of meaninglessness.
</P>
<P>
   With advanced technology, the distinction between authentic art
and imitations has also blurred. The scariest example is the
Polaroid Replica, a substitute for real brand-name art for those
who can't afford it _ i.e., almost everybody. The Polaroid
duplicates the scale and even the texture of the original. One of
the things traditionally prized about a painting is its uniqueness;
does cloning devalue it? What's sad about Polaroid Replicas is that
for the same amount of money, you can go to an art-school sale and
buy something created by a human hand, head, and heart.
</P>
<P>
   Art now invades your home via the Internet, where you can
purchase paintings without having seen them in the flesh, or check
out a museum Web site that allows you to rotate a piece of
sculpture 360 degrees, viewing it from all sides. CD-ROMs have made
accessible some art that you can't really see even in situ. The
installation at Pennsylvania's Barnes Foundation, for instance, is
so eccentric that some paintings _ those hung high over doorways,
for instance _ are better seen on a computer screen, where you can
also enlarge and home in on details. Art created for the computer
screen is still in its infancy, though; maturity will have to wait
for the next century.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shifting definitions
</P>
<P>
   For most of our century, there was faith in progress in art just
as there was in progress in the American economy. One thing would
always lead to another, and things would always get better. That's
the way art and art history were taught. Then, with the Vietnam
era, those certainties eroded.
</P>
<P>
   Definitions and demarcations began to shift. With the Happenings
of the 1960s, performing and visual arts merged _ an extension of
their joint ventures earlier in the century, under the auspices of
the impresario Serge Diaghilev. Multimedia collaborations among
giants such as John Cage, Merce Cunningham, and Robert Rauschenberg
constituted some of the most exciting art of the day. With
performance art, the boundaries between disciplines blurred
further, until you couldn't say who was the choreographer and who
designed the decor. Everybody tried everything.
</P>
<P>
   By the '60s, visual art was no longer a tidy progression of
styles in painting and sculpture. Painting in oils and sculpture in
bronze or marble weren't necessarily where the action was anyway.
In 1917, Marcel Duchamp had decreed that a urinal he dubbed
``Fountain'' was in fact sculpture; more recently, there has been a
flood of bathroom art, including Robert Gober's sinks and Kiki
Smith's crouching female urinating glass beads. Any material can be
made into art, and any subject can as well.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most ambitious categories of art in the second half of
the century was the Earthwork, which attempted nothing less than
altering the topography of the planet. Robert Smithson's 1,500-foot
black basalt ``Spiral Jetty,'' which curls its way into the Great
Salt Lake, is a tangible epic, an homage to myths about the lake's
origins, and an on-again, off-again presence, depending on the
rising and falling of the water. Is a work like ``Spiral Jetty''
really new? It's not much of a stretch to trace Earthworks back to
Stonehenge and before.
</P>
<P>
   Sculpture in neon, video, and light itself is another important
development of the late 20th century. Some work based on new
technology initially looked like science projects run amok, carried
away with whizbang gimmickry. A lot of it matured most
gratifyingly, though. Video artist Bill Viola, for instance, has
conquered technical difficulties to create grand-scale, weightless
images of birth and death, fire and rain, the elements of
existence. Bruce Nauman, who has worked in many media, including
himself, bathes those who venture into his quirky spaces in neon
light. James Turrell has spent more than two decades reshaping
Roden Crater, an Arizona volcano, into a place that frames and
concentrates light from sun, moon, and stars.
</P>
<P>
   There's an idealism in Turrell's megaproject, which no one will
ever buy. But the century has also seen plenty of art greed. The
art market boiled over in the 1980s, the hysteria exemplified by
the fate of van Gogh's ``Irises,'' sold at Sotheby's in 1987 for a
then-record $53.4 million. The buyer was Australian entrepreneur
Alan Bond, who, it turned out, couldn't afford the painting.
Sotheby's, which had lent him half the money in a move denounced as
ethically dubious, reclaimed it and sold it once more, this time to
the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The world's richest museum, the
Getty can afford anything _ although, of course, not everything is
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting in the 20th century has been degraded by the
commodification of art. Gone are the days when
collector-intellectuals such as Gertrude Stein and her clan from
America, and the Shchukin and Morozov families from Russia,
converged on Paris to compete for still-wet canvases by Picasso and
Matisse. Now we've got buyers like British ad tycoon Charles
Saatchi, who scoops up a museum's worth of new art only to dump it
on the market a few years later, sending some of the artists into
spirals of depression.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The photo revolution
</P>
<P>
   The granddaddy of the technology that is revamping art on what
seems an almost daily basis is photography, a 19th-century
invention that continued to change visual experience profoundly and
permanently through the 20th. Photography revolutionized the
practice of art history, through the color slide. It led to one of
the century's biggest publishing phenomena, the lavishly
illustrated coffee-table art book. Aerial photography helped free
painters from the horizon line. And photography brought other media
to broad public attention: Hans Namuth's photographs of Jackson
Pollock dancing around his studio splashing paint helped build the
legend of ``Jack the Dripper.''
</P>
<P>
   From Edward Steichen to Cindy Sherman, photography in the 20th
century grew from an art that imitated painting to one capable of
all kinds of tricks painting couldn't perform. Photography entered
the unlimited realm of ``mixed media.'' The pristine print was no
longer the goal. Artists once hand-colored black-and-white
photographs to make them look ``real''; now they paint them for
other reasons, and even bend them into sculpture. The 20th century
has also seen the development of play-acting in photography, from
F. Holland Day posing as the crucified Christ at the beginning of
the century to the contemporary Japanese artist Yasumasa Morimura
inserting his obviously Asian face into reproductions of paintings
by Titian, Rembrandt, and van Gogh. Photography made bigger strides
in the 20th century than either painting or sculpture, pace the
advent of abstraction. (The abstract photograph came along, too.)

<P>
   Abstraction is what many would cite as the defining feature of
20th-century art as we know it in the West. But that's murky
territory: Islamic painting, for instance, has been abstract for
centuries. The identity of the painter of the first completely
nonrepresentational canvas in the West in the early years of the
20th century is uncertain. It may have been the Russian Kasimir
Malevich, or the American Arthur Dove. What is clear is that
paintings that confined themselves to a single hue or geometric
motif opened the floodgates of possibility: Art was no longer tied
to observable reality; color and shape could exist independently.
</P>
<P>
   Abstraction also opened the floodgates of ridicule. People had
lampooned Impressionism in the 19th century. But in the 20th, the
divide between advanced art and the general public widened. There
were loads of ``You-call-that-art?'' controversies, centered around
religion, sex, or even, in the case of Damien Hirst's pickled
sharks and goats, accusations of cruelty to animals. There were
jokes about the ``hoax'' of Minimalism, a '60s style that has worn
better than anything else in the second half of the century. It's
Minimalism's contemporary, Color Field Painting, that, at century's
end, looks like just so much wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Hostilities between the art world and a skeptical public
escalated through the 1900s. Never before had ordinary people in
such large numbers felt so alienated from art, felt they didn't
``get'' it. This happened, ironically, even as the art world
increasingly co-opted ordinary people's turf. Consider Warhol's
soup cans.
</P>
<P>
   Another way visual artists have edged closer to everyday life is
to design functional, albeit often utopian, environments: Examples
are Andrea Zittel's ``Living Units'' and ``Pit Beds'' and Joep van
Lieshout's mobile homes that range from decadent to austere. Many
artists who yearn to be useful work in traditional ``craft'' areas.
There's been a late-century resurgence in glass, ceramics, and
handmade furniture, some by ``crossover'' artists trained in
``fine'' art. Their work answers a craving, in an age of
mechanization and mass production, for the handmade and unique.
</P>
<P>
   Scale became a signature of modern art. Early in the century,
Monet's paintings blanketed whole walls, as Abstract Expressionist
canvases did 50 years later. Later, art got even larger, whether it
was Christo wrapping the Reichstag, the vast Cor-ten steel
sculptures of Richard Serra, Rauschenberg's ``The 1/4 Mile or 2
Furlong Piece,'' or Maya Lin's haunting Vietnam War memorial, a low
black granite wall snaking its way into the earth. Lin's 1980
monument acts as balm on a century's worth of angry political art,
from Leon Golub's brutal paintings of torturers and their victims
to the Socialist Realism imposed on artists in Communist countries.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The blockbuster exhibition
</P>
<P>
   Art on a huge scale, and the advent of the blockbuster
exhibition that drew huge numbers, were dual impetuses behind the
20th century's museum-building boom. Existing art museums sprawled
ever larger, adding new wing after new wing. The truism about
architecturally splashy new museums is that the building counts as
the biggest work in its collection.
</P>
<P>
   Museums were relatively staid places before the advent of the
blockbuster, epitomized by the 1972 ``Treasures of Tutankhamen'' at
New York's Metropolitan Museum, staged by that great showman Thomas
Hoving. A quarter-century later, the appetite for big-budget
big-name shows had increased to the point that tickets for a
particular time of day had to be ordered in advance. Impressionism,
Egypt, ancient gold from practically anywhere, all are reliably big
at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbusters can be cynical displays of whatever museum
development departments think the public wants to see. Or they can
be breathtaking, bringing together works that will never, within a
single lifetime, share the same space again. The 1995 Vermeer show
organized by the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., and the
Mauritshuis in The Hague is a case of the latter, with most of that
master's slim output under one roof for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeer became an art star only in the 20th century; before
that, he'd been a ``lost'' painter, then a rediscovered one. The
notion of an art star is largely a 20th-century invention, with
Picasso the brightest in the firmament. Later artists, including
Warhol and Jeff Koons, made stardom a primary goal; art was merely
a means. They themselves became art.
</P>
<P>
   The museum building also achieved celebrity status. Projects
like the Grand Louvre in Paris or the vast branch that London's
Tate Gallery will open in a former power station on the Thames next
spring make headlines. Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain is
a twirling titanium pirouette that has quickly become the city's
symbol. Richard Meier's Getty Center is an arrogant, austere,
off-putting, off-white pile overlooking Los Angeles. I. M. Pei's
Miho Museum in Shiga, Japan, is the best thing he's ever done, and
one of the most humble, most of it built underneath a national
park. Stephen Holl's Kiasma museum in Helsinki is a curvaceous,
futuristic masterpiece for the electronic age. Thousands of people
make pilgrimages to these buildings; many go with little thought of
what's inside.
</P>
<P>
   Museums are being designed to accommodate not only existing
collections and new ones, but also the rewriting of art history.
African or Native American art that once was relegated to the
dioramas of ethnographic museums is now entering museums of fine
arts. Museums that once smugly identified themselves as
``encyclopedic'' are realizing they're not, and hastening to
acquire, say, South American art.
</P>
<P>
   There are endless curatorial debates over how to display and
categorize art that plays by different rules than those that
prevail in the West. Some African cultures, for instance, value
tradition and continuity over innovation and artistic ``progress,''
so a 100-year-old object will look like one made today. How does a
museum convey that idea? Should contemporary Asian art go in a
department devoted to contemporary art from around the world, or in
one that traces the development of Asian art from its origins to
now? Should departments be divvied up according to geography, era,
or medium? Defining ``contemporary art'' has proven particularly
tricky. And a few years back, museums with departments of
20th-century art started nervously looking ahead to the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The canon is expanding _ and fast. The standard joke about
``Outsider Art,'' subject of a slew of museum shows in the past
decade, is that it's now ``In.'' Since its first publication in
1962, H. W. Janson's ``History of Art,'' the premiere college text
on the subject, has undergone regular revisions, most notably to
add women and African-American artists. Those two groups, and
minorities in general, are still pitifully underrepresented in
museum collections and in high-profile exhibitions, though. We're
not yet over the cult of the Dead White Male.
</P>
<P>
   While Western museums scramble to acquire art from corners of
the world they didn't used to consider, some of those corners are
developing into important centers themselves. Sao Paulo,
Johannesburg, and Istanbul now hold respected biennials. There are
pockets of cutting-edge artists all over the globe; in countries
where governments still dictate art's content and style, some
survive underground. Some Western governments, most notably ours,
have little power to control art because they're unwilling to fund
it. For the most part, art in America has to pay its own way: Hence
the $17.50 ticket to the blockbuster show.
</P>
<P>
   The world's museums are winding up the century with a lot of
apologies for housing Nazi loot, and art whisked out of Third World
countries under dubious legal circumstances. There's a lot of
defiance, too. War and Colonialism mixed up what went where.
Sorting it all out is impossible; making the effort is a moral
imperative. At the beginning of the 19th century, the seventh Earl
of Elgin brought great marble figures from the Parthenon to
Britain. At the close of the 20th, a leading British newspaper, The
Guardian, has broken ranks and called for their return.

 NEW YORK'S CASES OF RACIAL INJUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If Lucy McKnight had ever been certain of
anything, she was certain she had been wronged.
</P>
<P>
   She had been working for the New York State Dormitory Authority.
An active Democrat and an African-American, she had been hired
during the administration of Mario Cuomo. After George Pataki and
his Republicans took over New York state government in 1994,
McKnight suffered health problems and missed some work. When she
was fired, she noted that a number of white folks with similar
absences hadn't been discharged. So McKnight filed suit against the
dormitory authority alleging racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   When the suit finally made it to federal court a few weeks back,
McKnight was appalled to discover that all 100 people who made up
the jury pool were white. There would not be a single black face on
the jury that would hear her case.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason for that. The federal court district covering
the northeastern portion of this sprawling, 50,000-square-mile
state constitutes a part of the world where black folks make up
less than 3 percent of the population. Plus the federal jury pool
is culled from voter rolls and New York State Department of Motor
Vehicle records. Statistically, African-Americans are less likely
than whites to be voters, licensed drivers or car owners.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight lost her case. She believes firmly that if the jury had
contained even one member who had had a gut sense of what racial
discrimination feels like, she would have won. That may or not be
true, but the intensity of McKnight's conviction in this matter is
only one more indication of the stunning gulf that stretches
between whites and minorities on issues like this.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in this town, we're about to see another illustration of
just how immense that gulf can be. We'll see it when four New York
City police officers go on trial, probably late next month, for the
shooting death on Feb. 4 of a black West African immigrant in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Amadou Diallo, an innocent man, was standing in a darkened
doorway late at night. Four officers hunting a rape suspect
approached him, guns in hand. What happened next will be the crux
of this murder case against the cops. Diallo either did something
to lead the cops to believe mistakenly that he was reaching for a
weapon or they behaved with criminal recklessness when they fired
41 slugs into that vestibule.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a huge and heavily publicized case in New York
City. In the spring, the Rev. Al Sharpton led daily protests
outside police headquarters in Manhattan. More than 1,700 people,
many show business celebrities and prominent politicians, managed
to get themselves arrested at the demonstrations. Now an appeals
court has ruled that New York City media coverage has been so
feverish that the cops could never get a fair trial there. Instead,
the cop will be tried in Albany, the closest New York jurisdiction
of any size that doesn't watch New York City television stations.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney will prosecute this case. But
instead of the jury being chosen from a pool in the Bronx, where
whites constitute a distinct minority, this jury instead will be
drawn from Albany County, where the jury pool is 92 percent white.
It should be remembered, too, that the last time police officers
went on trial in this town charged with excessive violence against
a black arrestee _ just a few months back, in the infamous,
foul-smelling Jermaine Henderson case _ an all-white jury found the
police officers not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson had alleged, in rather plausible terms, that the cops
had beaten him while he was in handcuffs. But the Albany County
district attorney's office _ apparently eager to take a dive that
even Greg Louganis would have envied _ had threatened to prosecute
him for perjury if he testified in open court because of
inconsistencies in his grand jury testimony. Henderson stayed away
from the trial, and the cops walked.
</P>
<P>
   This Diallo disaster will be a huge, hot case in Albany. The
courthouse is bound to be encircled daily by protesters bussed up
from New York City. Sharpton is sure to be at his loudest and least
responsible. Meanwhile, Lucy McKnight and other African-Americans
all over New York will be watching closely, as will most white
people, too.
</P>
<P>
   Each from their own side of that yawning gulf we were talking
about.
</P>

RECRUITER WINS $19 MILLION JURY VERDICT

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A high-powered executive recruiter who lost her
ability to do high-pressure work on deadline after a rear-end auto
collision has won a $19 million award from the owner of the truck
that hit her.
</P>
<P>
   In a verdict reached Friday in San Francisco Superior Court, a
jury ordered Winterland Productions to pay the larger award to
Janis Zivic, 56, a former city library commissioner and
$600,000-per-year ``headhunter'' with the Spencer Stuart executive
search firm.
</P>
<P>
   Zivic suffered brain injuries when her BMW sedan was hit from
behind in a chain-reaction accident on an exit ramp of Interstate
280 in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A Mack Truck owned by Winterland caused the wreck when it
careened out of control on the exit ramp and rammed another car,
which then struck Zivic's auto, the jury found.
</P>
<P>
   Zivic was partially paralyzed and had to have emergency brain
surgery, said her lawyer, James S. Bostwick. But she made a
remarkable recovery and eight months later was back at her job.
Problems quickly became evident, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very intelligent, and when you meet her you would never
know it, but she has serious problems with recall and memory,''
Bostwick said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a very high-pressure, high-level job (in which) you've
got to do what you do very fast, remember details, do about six
things at once,'' he said. ``And now, if somebody interrupts her,
she can't keep her train of thought. ... She can't do two things at
once.''
</P>
<P>
   In a two-week trial before Judge John Munter, medical experts
testified that Zivic had lost her ability to perform ``higher-level
executive functions,'' especially on deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In its verdict, the jury found that Zivic could still do
less-demanding work, and might well bring in as much as $70,000 per
year for it.
</P>
<P>
   But jurors agreed her head-hunting days were over. Of the award,
$17 million was largely to compensate Zivic for lost earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Zivic, the daughter of former welterweight boxing champion
Fritzie Zivic, was a Pittsburgh schoolteacher when she moved to San
Francisco and landed a job in the personnel department at
Crown-Zellerbach. She won a series of promotions and better jobs,
eventually going to work for Spencer Stuart's San Francisco office,
where she specialized in recruiting top-tier executives for big
companies.
</P>
<P>
   She also served for six years as president of the San Francisco
Family Services Agency and was named to the Library Commission by
then-Mayor Frank Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, she earned more than $600,000, most of it commissions,
according to evidence in the case. The year of the accident she had
already earned $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred while Zivic was stopped in traffic on the
Embarcadero. Truck driver Larry Randolph said he plowed into the
line of cars after his brakes failed on the off-ramp. Zivic said
she hopes to use the award to set up a foundation to promote early
childhood education programs.

&HT;     JACOB DISPLACES MICHAEL AS THE NAME FOR BABY BOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Michael, the king of baby names for 45 years,
has been deposed.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob became the most popular baby name among boys in 1999,
according to Social Security records compiled by the San
Francisco-based BabyCenter.com, and Internet baby resource
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The top girl's name for the year was Emily, popular throughout
the decade. Last year's favorite, Kaitlyn, might have been a fad,
because it plummeted to seventh place on this year's top 10 list.
Other favored girls names after Emily were Sarah, Brianna,
Samantha, Hailey and Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   Following Jacob and Michael this year were Matthew, Nicholas,
Christopher and Joshua, Babycenter announced Monday. The Internet
company provides information, support and products for parents.
</P>
<P>
   Names that have climbed onto the top 100 list as 2000 approaches
include Austin, Isaiah and Jack for boys; Emma, Cloe and Sophia for
girls. As technology brings the world closer, expect Americans to
look overseas for names, and even more traditional last names to be
used as first names _ Riley, Taylor, Morgan, Tyler and Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   How was Michael squeezed out?
</P>
<P>
   Baby name specialist Cleveland Evans of Bellevue University in
Omaha, Neb., said society ushered out the popular ``J'' names of
the '80s _ Justin, Joshua, Jason, Jeremy _ but still liked the
sounds of them. In Jacob, a classical biblical name, they found a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There finally comes a point where something new comes up and
people don't realize it's so popular, so it can sneak in,'' said
Evans, a psychology professor who studies fads and fashions in
names.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob has plenty going for it, as names go. BabyCenter.com says
a survey of 22,000 parents found that half call their children by a
nickname _ Jacob's would be Jake. And Evans said names with long
``a'' vowels are popular lately, for boys and girls. Some examples:
Haley, Bailey and Caitlin.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think society is entering a new century of
enlightenment, consider this: one-third of parents said they picked
boys names based on whether they would look good on resumes and
bring success.
</P>
<P>
   But with baby girls, parents are more likely to take a chance
that a name winds up being a fad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (parents) don't project her as much into the future,''
Evans said. Therefore, cuteness and youth often prevail _ names
like Christy, Brianna or Ashley, which was the No. 1 girl's name of
the decade, according to BabyCenter.
</P>
<P>
   So are baby girls taken less seriously?
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is psychological and part of it is biological,''
Evans said. ``Women are supposed to be young. Young is good for
women. It's good for men, but it's not a requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Names, he said, tell more about parents than children.
</P>
<P>
   Upper middle-class families from old money like antiques,
classical music and also like names traditionally applied to the
upper-crust, such as Emma, Henry and Eleanor. But blue-collar
families say the past has not been all that good for them, Evans
said, and they want to focus on emerging names. Hence, Cheyenne and
Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael, a Catholic name, wasn't used much in colonial New
England because Protestants thought it sacrilegious to name a child
after an angel. But Michael, and other Catholic names like Patrick
and Christopher, later gained popularity, especially with Irish
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, people began naming children after adored stars,
such as Gary for Gary Cooper and Gregory after Gregory Peck.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Deborah Kerr and Debbie Reynolds, some variation of
the names gained ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who wanted the girls perky or sophisticated, the
name got hit from both sides,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Not every star was copied. Few followed Warren Beatty, whose
name was commonly associated with older men, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And few name their son after Brad Pitt because Brad is already
too common.
</P>
<P>
   But Evans said the same year Pitt's movie ``Legends of the
Fall'' (in which Pitt plays a character named Tristan) came out,
there ``were little Tristans all over the place.'' Ditto for Dylan
and Brandon in Beverly Hills 90210.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said parents should think about the values their baby's
name is expressing and then decide if those are the values they
want to reflect.
</P>
<P>
   BabyCenter.com found that 90 percent of parents in their survey
picked a name before the baby was born, and that their primary goal
was to pick a unique name.
</P>
<P>
   And for those of you about to give birth and planning to come up
with a common name with an uncommon spelling, please think again,
Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That drives me up the wall,'' he said, pointing out the
popular Caley is now Kaylee, Kaley, Kayleigh and Kaylie, and goes
on ``ad nauseum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's counterproductive. The kid isn't going to have any
advantages. They're going to go through their whole life spelling
it for people,'' he said. ``And people won't think it's creative.
They'll think the parents were illiterate.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Reworking Virginia Woolf has come into vogue recently, with
books like Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning ``The
Hours'' reconsidering the author's stories from alternate
viewpoints. Belgian author and psychoanalyst Jacqueline Harpman
does Woolf one better though, in her 12th novel, the newly
translated ``Orlanda.'' In this brief, light read, winner of
France's Prix Medicis, Harpman not only updates Woolf's
``Orlando,'' the tale of a gender-shifting protagonist, she also
makes her protagonist a literary scholar, one who is deeply
critical of Woolf.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Harpman's take on Woolf's classic is a direct parallel.
Rather than having one character shift sexes, as Orlando does,
Harpman's heroine, Aline, splits to live simultaneously in the
original female body and in that of a young man, Lucien, whom Aline
briefly, nearly unconsciously, admires in a train station. As
befits the creation of a psychoanalyst's mind, Aline's male persona
(who renames himself Orlanda) is really the rambunctious youthful
part of herself that she repressed upon hitting the latency period
that precedes adolescence. That this splinter personality decides
to take up residence in a handsome young man, 20 years old to
Aline's 35, is a result of society and convenience. Orlanda knows
that in a man's body he/she will be more free to play and to
experiment sexually. Perhaps more important for the impulsive
10-year-old spirit, the male ``host'' was there, sitting beside the
heroine in the station _ a place of transition _ at just the right
time.
</P>
<P>
   No, Aline does not have a multiple-personality disorder. Harpman
plays her story very straight, a metaphor that comes to life as
Aline works on an analysis of the Woolf original, which she
initially dreads. As if disowning the magic in her otherwise
realistic novel, Harpman occasionally inserts herself as a third
voice: a narrator who washes her hands of her errant characters as
they defy nature and personal boundaries to follow their own whims.
Her narrator's air of bemusement colors the entire book, and
actually makes the more far-fetched parts seem feasible. ``I think
he reminds me of a love affair that I did not have, because I was
too young or too silly,'' she writes about her newly emerged
Orlanda, and muses further: ``Unfortunately, I did not have the
presence of mind to turn into a boy and become adventurous.'' In
general, her breezy style works, making what could be a too-clever
work amusing and, at times, beautiful. ``Let us listen too for a
while,'' she writes of a concert attended by Orlanda. ``Time kills
us, second after second, and we fools continue to be impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   However, this same air of detachment also shackles Harpman's
story. On occasion, she skims too lightly, risking superficiality
with observations like: ``Where is my sense of propriety . . . to
my utter amazement, I see that she is smiling. Orlanda's influence
has really transformed her!'' Besides, its lighthearted approach
makes a deep connection to these characters' emotional lives
difficult; it's hard to feel that the entire book is anything but
an intellectual conceit. ``I have no blood on my hands, just a
little ink,'' Harpman herself admits, dismissing final
responsibility for her characters _ and perhaps for the work. For
all its spots of glory, as well as its occasional insights into the
older work, ``Orlanda'' remains a pleasurable pastime, an amusement
of the ``what if'' sort, but one a disciplined academic like Aline
would likely dismiss.

<P>
   If you're looking for a stocking stuffer for the music lover on
your Christmas list, Yaboom Ltd., a joint venture between Toymax
International Inc. and Street Life Ltd., has come up with Music on
the Go musical key chains.
</P>
<P>
   The palm-sized players, with attached key chain, play a full
song by an artist of your choice: Ricky Martin, Britney Spears, the
Backstreet Boys, TLC, Celine Dion, Cher, Shania Twain and 'N Sync.
Powered by three L1154 batteries (included), the key chains retail
for less than $15 at music and other stores. Although the company
raves about the sound quality of the tiny player, only a true lover
of the artist _ or a teen-ager _ probably will appreciate the tinny
tones. &QL;

   SCI-ANCIENT-FLOWERS (Undated) _ A trove of fossils in
Sayreville, N.J., reveals what plant life was like when dinosaurs
roamed New Jersey. Researchers say the findings are turning
botanical lore on its head, by revealing that the great
diversification of flowering plants, the most species-rich and
important group of plants on earth, took place at least 90 million
years ago, some 30 million years earlier than previously suspected.

his baby daughter, Katie, while she was still in the womb. But
doctors say there is a good chance that they may have saved Katie's

treating the affected eye before the cancer had a chance to grow

   What really matters to Americans during the December holidays?
According to a nationwide Lutheran Brotherhood survey, Americans'
favorite holiday activity is celebrating with their families, and
shopping is the necessary evil of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three-quarters (70 percent) of the 1,000 adults surveyed
by telephone said being with family and friends is their favorite
part of the holiday season. It is also their favorite holiday
memory from childhood (74 percent).
</P>
<P>
   While only 3 percent selected shopping as their favorite
activity, almost one-third (30 percent) said if money were no
object, they would spend a lot more on gifts than they currently
do.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two-thirds of those surveyed (61 percent) said the
December holidays have less religious significance now than when
they were growing up, and more than half (54 percent) blame the
decline on pressure to buy and give expensive gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, 62 percent said they really don't like shopping for,
wrapping or assembling gifts. A distant second (11 percent) said
sending and receiving holiday cards is their least favorite holiday
task.

Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

   There's a new book out on the First Amendment that ought to be
given as a holiday gift to every library and school board in the
nation _ Robert S. Peck's ``Libraries, the First Amendment, and
Cyberspace,'' published by the American Library Association.
</P>
<P>
   If board members of our public libraries and public schools were
to read it, in all likelihood there would be fewer of those
sweeping-but-futile restrictions adopted to limit Internet use.
Consequently, there would be fewer successful lawsuits against
schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Peck is a well-respected First Amendment scholar, who teaches
constitutional law at American University in Washington, D.C. He
was a judicial fellow at the U.S. Supreme Court and is now senior
director for Legal Affairs and Policy Research for the Association
of Trial Lawyers of America.
</P>
<P>
   In writing this book, Peck researched all the relevant U.S.
Supreme Court cases and federal appellate cases that address the
First Amendment rights of public school students and the patrons of
public libraries _ as well as the free speech obligations of both
public institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Peck gives citations for the court decisions quoted so that
attorneys and interested readers can look up those rulings and read
them for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   However, this book is written for the layman, in a clear prose,
not legal jargon, and should be understandable by anyone who can
read at a high school level.
</P>
<P>
   It also contains appendices that include the Library Bill of
Rights and its interpretation in regard to issues like challenged
material, restricted access, building diversity of opinion in a
collection and library initiated programs.
</P>
<P>
   One appendix gives guidelines for developing a public library
Internet-use policy consistent with First Amendment jurisprudence
and the Library Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The book opens with a valuable question and answer section that
both clarifies legal concepts in First Amendment law and in broad
terms clarifies how they apply to public libraries and public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Peck ferrets out the questions often asked and answers them
briefly: ``Does the First Amendment include the right of access to
information?''; ``Do children have lesser First Amendment rights
than adults?''; ``What has the Supreme Court said about the First
Amendment's treatment of the Internet?'' The chapters that follow
answer those same questions and many more in greater detail.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to the question, ``What is the constitutional status
of libraries?'', Peck devotes a portion of his response to the
public school library: ``The Supreme Court has called the school
library a place where students may `test or expand upon ideas
presented ... in or out of the classroom' and a venue for
`self-education and individual enrichment that is wholly optional'
and without the restraints that may be placed on students in the
`compulsory environment of the classroom.''' The high court
decision Peck quotes is Island Trees Union Free School District No.
26 vs. Pico (1982) _ a decision significant to all public school
libraries, school librarians and our children.
</P>
<P>
   The second chapter describes basic freedom of speech and free
press principles and shows how those principles apply to libraries.
Public libraries are state, county, parish or city governmental
agencies; therefore, the Supreme Court has held them to the same
First Amendment prohibitions that are imposed on the federal
government: ``Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom
of speech, or of the press ....''
</P>
<P>
   Peck outlines the scope of the First Amendment by quoting
several Supreme Court decisions: ``Our commitment to free speech,
in one of the court's most classical formulations, anticipates
`uninhibited, robust, and wide-open' debate that `may well include
vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp' language. It
embraces the notion that `above all else, the First Amendment means
that government has no power to restrict expression because of its
message, its ideas, its subject matter, nor its content.'
</P>
<P>
   Further, Peck notes, ``And it extends to the notion that `the
right to receive ideas is a necessary predicate to the recipient's
meaningful exercise of his own rights of speech, press, and
political freedom.' Thus in addition to protecting the rights of
speakers, `the First Amendment protects the public's interest in
receiving information.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the conclusion of the chapter, Peck warns, ``It is inevitable
that speech will be controversial and that libraries will become
embroiled in those controversies. It is critical that libraries
recognize their custodianship of intellectual freedom and remain
vigilant of these liberties even in the face of severe criticism
for the books, materials, and access they provide.''
</P>
<P>
   The book includes a chapter titled, ``Children, Schools, and the
First Amendment.'' It should be required reading for all high
school students, teachers and principals. Far too often, we short
change our youth in regard to their free speech rights. Peck
reviews for the reader all the pertinent case law regarding
children's First Amendment rights in the public school setting.
</P>
<P>
   Peck writes at the end of this chapter, ``Most importantly, the
courts have recognized that schools and school libraries should
serve a goal of open inquiry and further the exploration of ideas,
and objective that is palpably consistent with the philosophy
underlying the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that reason, any removal of school library books will
receive such heightened judicial scrutiny that the removal is
unlikely to survive the constitutional objection.''
</P>
<P>
   The final chapter is the key chapter for those concerned with
Internet access: ``Cyberspace _ The Last Frontier.'' Peck has
researched all the Supreme Court decisions regarding other media
and communications systems -- newspapers, books, radio, television
and the telephone. The high court has noted that the differences in
the media require different First Amendment standards. The print
media has traditionally received the greatest First Amendment
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Peck analyzes the high court's decision in the Communications
Decency Act case. A unanimous high court found the CDA
unconstitutional because it was not narrowly tailored to protect
minors from harmful materials.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the act would have suppressed speech that adults have a
constitutional right to receive. This case is pivotal to all
restrictions on Internet access by government agencies. In its
decision the Supreme Court granted the Internet the same high level
of First Amendment protection as that of the print media.
</P>
<P>
   Peck concludes: ``Any policy on Internet access that a public
library adopts cannot adversely affect adult access to protected
speech, must respect the rights of access of both older minors and
younger minors who have a right to access protected speech and some
speech that parents could find troubling but have serious value for
youth, and must respect the rights of parents who choose to permit
their children to access sites that others might deem appropriate
only for more mature individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Peck has done us all a great service in writing this book now
during the height of the controversies over Internet access and the
concern over children seeing pornographic Web sites. His book
offers insights into what can be done and still be within the legal
constraints of the First Amendment.

THE `LOWDOWN' ON WOODY ALLEN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The conundrums about Woody Allen, his films and his life, are
pretty well summed up when he describes his primary artistic
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tough part is being able to be funny and to get the dark
side in as well,'' the filmmaker says. ``It'a a hard thing to do.
If you miss the balance, as I sometimes do, you get something
that's too light and doesn't really say what you want; or, worse,
too dark, and then nobody wants to see it. That happens to me. It's
not an exact science.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not. But at least on the screen,
writer-director-frequent star Allen has gotten it right more often
than most of his contemporaries. Of course, the fact that, at age
64, he's long been America's most prolific filmmaker (averaging at
least one feature per year since 1984) gives him more chances.
</P>
<P>
   But when you really consider it, who else has consistently
pumped out a pretty great film every couple of at-bats for three
decades? Allen's honor roll includes such early '70s satires as
``Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex'' and ``Sleeper,''
grows through the Oscar-winning ``Annie Hall'' and matures into the
more rueful, semi-comic character inquiries ``Manhattan,'' ``Hannah
and Her Sisters,'' ``Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' ``Husbands and
Wives'' and ``Deconstructing Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   In between there have been less successful straight dramas,
conceptual comedies of varying mirth and, perhaps most
delightfully, a series of show-biz subculture studies (``Broadway
Danny Rose,'' ``Radio Days,'' ``Bullets Over Broadway'') that have
affectionately captured past eras and their attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet and Lowdown,'' Allen's latest release, combines a light
tone and an ulikable protagonist, then sets the mixture in a
low-rent, 1930s jazz milieu. It's kind of everything the artist and
his art _ Allen is, after all, a dedicated amateur clarinetist with
a less-than-pristine track record with women _ is about.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't tell him that. True to his renowned kvetchiness,
Allen takes issue with most attempts to pigeonhole or explicate
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things people always do with my films are make comparisons
and try to find me in there someplace,'' says Allen, a small,
fragile figure in nondescript green sweater, corduroys with
rubbed-out knees and his trademark black-framed glasses. ``I'm not
blaming them for it; there have been films where, clearly, there
are hints of myself in them. But many times, not at all; it's like
they're trying to find the Ninas in the Hirschfeld drawings.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caine, one of many actors whom Allen has directed to
Academy Awards (for ``Hannah and Her Sisters''), is among the
sizable number of associates who in fact believe that the best way
to understand Woody is through his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to know him more making the picture than I did for the
20 years we'd been acquainted before that,'' Caine reveals. ``And
not through personal contact, but through the screenplay, which was
autobiographical.''
</P>
<P>
   Draw your own conclusions about the ``Sweet and Lowdown''
parallels. As with the director's ``Zelig,'' it's a
pseudo-documentary about a legendary guitar genius, Emmet Ray, who
never existed (Allen appears briefly as a modern-day commentator,
as do several real-life jazz experts). Played by Sean Penn, Emmet
supposedly was an egotistical, irresponsible gambler, drunk,
sometime pimp and full-time womanizer who, nonetheless, made the
most beautiful guitar music in the world this side of Django
Reinhardt (in whose presence Emmet faints dead away). Less a
traditional musical than even Allen's oddball ``Everyone Says I
Love You'' from a few years back, ``Sweet'' is gaga with great
tunes and lovingly re-created period detail. But Emmet is a
complete creep, especially in his treatment of an adoring young
woman, Hattie (the young British actress Samantha Morton), whom he
realizes too late is his mute muse.
</P>
<P>
   Allen claims that he just wanted to make a film about a
musician. But there is something about Emmet that, he admits, comes
from inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known so many jazz musicians, and there are other artists
like this, who play so beautifully that you think they're just full
of sensitivity and they could not be any other way,'' he reveals.
``Then, when you meet them, they're self-centered and nasty,
egotistical braggarts and insensitive to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Sean could play that because he's got a real
ferocious side,'' Allen adds. ``But he's a very, very sensitive
person, really. He couldn't give those kind of performances, like
in `Dead Man Walking,' if he wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Penn has his reputation for trouble, though one quite
different from Allen's. And, refreshingly, the outspoken,
rebellious actor brought none of the director's neurotic screen
mannerisms to the role, avoiding a trap that caught John Cusack in
``Bullets Over Broadway'' and Kenneth Branagh in ``Celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear Woody when I read the script,'' Penn explains.
``And if I had, the thing going against playing it that way is that
people have been so saturated with it. I have modeled some
performances on directors, but in this case I would probably not do
that because, one, then he should play it, and also because I just
didn't hear this character in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Penn did find consistent between ``Sweet'' and Allen's
other films was the quality of the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``To begin with, in the world that I'm growing up in as a movie
actor, there is writing in them,'' Penn says. ``Which is a big
departure from most of the things that come around. I think most of
us celebrate this guy as an important writer who knows how to press
the buttons. You read or see his stuff and it moves you, with
uncommon views on common matters that are provocative. And he's
such a perceptive observer of people; it's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, naturally, shrugs off such praise. Real film artists, he
reckons, are guys like his European idols Ingmar Bergman and
Federico Fellini (he also dismisses comparisons between ``Sweet''
and its obvious influence, Fellini's ``La Strada'') _ not some
pampered Manhattanite who refuses to inconvenience himself for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do all my films in a very lazy way,'' he points out. ``I do
them near where I live. I don't like to travel, I don't like to
make sacrifices, I don't like to work a long day. Now, when I first
started in the business, you're so thrilled that they're letting
you make a film that you're up at 5 in the morning, working fast
and shooting in freezing weather and flying to Budapest 'cause it's
cheaper there. Then, after a couple of films, I stopped and said
this is ridiculous. Films are not my top priority; my life is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to eat leisurely at lunch. I want to come home at 6
o'clock at night, not at 10 o'clock. If the choice was between
doing another angle on a shot and getting home in time to watch the
Knicks on television, I go home. If you notice, so often over the
last 20 years I do everything in one shot. People have said that
it's a style, but it's not; it's laziness. Somebody else would
shoot your closeup and yours and yours, two-shots and
over-the-shoulders, they'd take three days on each scene. But I
just don't have the patience for that; they have more dedication to
the process than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Allen is unabashedly dedicated to, off and on
throughout his work and certainly in ``Sweet,'' is recapturing the
flavor and attitudes of the past on film, informed by his decidedly
downscale Brooklyn youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great attraction for the past in terms of
storytelling,'' he admits. ``When I used to go to the movies, it
was always a treat to see something like `My Fair Lady' that
projected back into Victorian England or somewhere. It's fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the subcultures are really the cultures that I know. I
come from a lower, lower-middle-class family, and the people I grew
up with were not high-tone people. They were little managers like
Broadway Danny Rose, with jugglers they would try to book
someplace. They were musicians who were not in symphonies, but guys
who hustled for jobs in the mountains. My father was a cab driver,
ran a pool room, was a bookmaker for a while ... So that's what I
grew up knowing. And I always found those characters funny and
likable and basically honest _ within certain parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he's long been a member of New York's creative elite,
some feel that Allen operates outside all parameters. Now married
and the father of a year-old daughter, few can forget that Allen's
wife, Soon-Yi Previn, was the adopted daughter of his former
girlfriend (and mother of his other child), Mia Farrow.
</P>
<P>
   Allen acknowledges that the disappointment he feels when beloved
artists don't live up to his personal expectations reflects how
many others feel about him. And he insists, as he always has, that
he couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's of no interest to me how I'm regarded,'' he contends.
``Though I am, in actual fact, quite the opposite of the hero of
this movie. I'm actually a very sweet person who is not a profound
artist. But I do have a personality that has its advantages and
disadvantages. I am very, very focused, and it can be read that
this guy's aloof, doesn't care about anything and just does his
work, is isolated or insensitive. On the other hand, the advantage
of it is that you can work. In a crisis or any other kind of
situation, you're focused and you don't get distracted off the main
point, you don't waste a lot of time on nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other wrong impressions Allen says people have of him:
that he doesn't like to act in other directors' films (he just
finished one, ``Picking Up the Pieces''); that he knows all there
is to know about such complicated subjects as philosophy and
psychology (``I've made very little headway in understanding life's
big questions''); and that he doesn't like L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt bad about L.A.,'' he insists. ``It's not where
I would want to live because I like a much more hectic urban
center. L.A. is more rural for me, but I enjoy coming here. My wife
loves it, and seeing her enjoying it is pleasurable for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've teased L.A. a lot, and because of that, people think I
hate the place,'' concludes the ever-misunderstood Allen. ``But
I've teased my parents a lot over the years, and psychoanalysis.
You know, you can only really make jokes about things that you have
some feeling for. If you hate a thing, you have no detachment, and
if you write about it, it comes out very unentertaining.'' &QL;

GOOD WILL HAUNTED: THE TALENTED MATT DAMON TESTS HIS DARK SIDE 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Matt Damon with Gwyneth Paltrow in a
scene from ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Talk about feast or famine.
 &HT;    While filming ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' in Italy, newly minted
superstar Matt Damon spent his days portraying Tom Ripley, a deeply
solitary figure with no self-esteem. Then he'd emerge from his
trailer to the screams of gaggles of young Italian girls shrieking,
``Matt Damon! Matt Damon!''
 &HT;    ``I never really get used to it,'' says Damon, who _ along with
pal Ben Affleck _ swept to fame in 1998 on the Oscar-winning ``Good
Will Hunting'' juggernaut.
 &HT;    ``When Ben and I went to shoot `Dogma' (1999), it was the night
after the Academy Awards,'' he recalls. ``We had to fly to
Pittsburgh, and there were about 10 people waiting at the airport,
which was really strange _ nothing like that had ever happened to
me before.
 &HT;    ``We got off the airplane and we were signing autographs and
taking photos with people,'' he says. ``There was this whole fever
pitch, and then someone from `Dogma' showed up and said, `Let's get
these guys through!' And it seemed almost mobbish for a second.''
 &HT;    The affable Damon, sitting in a suite at Los Angeles' Four
Seasons hotel, shakes his baseball-cap-covered head in lingering
disbelief.
 &HT;    He and Affleck, still trailed by those 10 fans, walked a
quarter-mile to a tram that would shuttle them to the airport's
main terminal, he adds.
 &HT;    ``We got on the tram and these people had to get on the tram,
too,'' Damon says bemusedly. ``By the time we got to our cars, they
were just talking and were not even interested in us anymore.''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``It's this situation that's perpetuated by circumstances,'' he
says thoughtfully. ``When those circumstances are manipulated and
what's normally a 30-second experience turns into a 30-minute
experience, it becomes, `All right, see you, guys!'
 &HT;    ``It was a really interesting study of that whole phenomenon.''
 &HT;    Perhaps coincidentally, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' _ which will
open nationwide on Christmas _ is itself an exploration of the
nature of idolatry, taking it to a jarring, disturbing extreme.
 &HT;    Written and directed by Anthony Minghella, who made the
Oscar-winning ``The English Patient,'' and based on the novel by
Patricia Highsmith, the film casts Damon as Tom Ripley, a
chameleonesque, gay nobody in 1950s New York. The tragic story line
gets underway when a wealthy shipbuilder (James Rebhorn) hires
Ripley to bring home his wayward son Dickie (Jude Law), who, along
with his girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), has been leading the
lush life in Italy.
 &HT;    Dickie's elegant lifestyle so fascinates Ripley that he decides
to achieve it for himself, first by worming his way into Dickie's
favor and then ... well, by any means necessary.
 &HT;    ``We all project a certain amount of happiness on somebody
else's life and make assumptions about other people,'' Damon says.
``I'm certainly guilty of doing it. `Ripley' is a riff on that, but
we play it all the way out.
 &HT;    ``When you start to root for a guy like Ripley,'' he adds, ``and
some people do, you've got to think to yourself, `Well, what does
that say about me?'
 &HT;    ``Hopefully, that question will stay with people after the
lights come back on in the theater,'' Damon says. ``Hopefully,
people will take away the feeling that they're implicated in it
all.
 &HT;    ``In that sense, `Ripley' is a cautionary tale.''
 &HT;    But, since Damon admits that even he started to root for Ripley,
what does that say about him?
 &HT;    ``Exactly,'' he says, breaking into a toothy grin. ``That's why
I had to do the movie. That's why I felt `Ripley' was important, in
terms of the way it goes against the grain of the way movies are
made nowadays.
 &HT;    ```Ripley' really says something,'' the actor adds, ``and its
tone is so original. It was exciting, because I hadn't seen
something like `Ripley' in a long time. Our hero is a very complex
antihero.''
 &HT;    And, it should be noted, Damon delivers a very complex
performance, a well-calibrated one that smartly plays off his
youthful good looks and aw-shucks charm. It's as if the Devil rose
from the pits of Hell and was reborn as the boy next door.
 &HT;    Damon doesn't consider Ripley a despicable character, however.
It's a subtle distinction, but he thinks of him as a guy who
commits despicable acts.
 &HT;    ``The whole challenge of the movie was to keep the audience with
Ripley, not in the sense that they're sympathetic, but in the sense
that they understand what he does,'' the actor says. ``They can
disagree with what he does, but they understand it because they
know where it's coming from, which is this deep loneliness that
this guy (feels).
 &HT;    ``He's so desperately trying not to be alone,'' Damon says,
``and you see that he has this incredible capacity for love, I
think, and sensitivity. He's really far more good to the people
around him than Dickie is.
 &HT;    ``Dickie is very careless, but he just has this incredible
charisma and can leave people totally gobsmacked,'' he adds. ``He's
like the sun, with everyone orbiting around him, but he's totally
oblivious to it. Tom would never treat people that way if he had
Dickie's life.''
 &HT;    Damon's own life has not been the same since ``Good Will
Hunting'' became an unexpected breakout hit a couple of years ago.
The actor, in fact, has spoken often of how he lives out of two
duffel bags that he's dragged from set to set.
 &HT;    After ``Good Will Hunting,'' Damon turned up in ``Rounders''
(1998), then the current ``Dogma'' _ in a role even darker than
Ripley, since he plays a casually murderous renegade angel. Several
other films are already shot, including ``All the Pretty Horses,''
directed by Billy Bob Thornton, and ``The Third Wheel,'' a romantic
comedy, starring Denise Richards and Luke Wilson, which is produced
by Damon and Affleck, who make cameos.
 &HT;    Just completed is ``The Legend of Bagger Vance,'' a Robert
Redford-directed ``fairy tale'' about a golfer (Damon) who has lost
his soul and must be redeemed by a mysterious caddie (Will Smith).
 &HT;    As the holidays approach, Damon is at last slowing down and
catching his breath. At home in his Manhattan apartment, he'll
unpack those well-traveled duffel bags and squeeze in some quality
time with his girlfriend, actress Winona Ryder.
 &HT;    And, despite the high price of fame _ most notably the loss of
anonymity _ Damon intends to count his blessings as the new year
begins. He has no film about to go into production, and he and
Affleck are only now beginning their next script.
 &HT;    ``I'm looking forward to getting a little time to reflect on
everything that's happened to me, because I haven't had that yet,''
he says softly. ``I'll have six months off, and all I'm planning on
doing is writing a script. I think it'll be a good time for me to
reflect and spend time with my family and friends.
 &HT;    ``But I can't think of anything I'd want to be different right
now.''

OLIVER STONE: THE SAME OLD GAME ON A WHOLE NEW FIELD

 (Includes a color slide of Oliver Stone directing Al Pacino and
Cameron Diaz in a scene from ``Any Given Sunday.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The ball is in Oliver Stone's hands and the clock is ticking
down.
 &HT;    The people at Warner Bros. are rooting for a touchdown, and the
pressure is on.
 &HT;    ``There is such a level of intensity before I release a film
that I've actually had to develop a skin as tough as a football,''
Stone says.
 &HT;    The football metaphors come naturally to the director, taking
time out for an interview before diving back into the massive task
of getting his latest film edited in time for its Dec. 22 opening.
 &HT;    That film _ which, at $55 million and counting, has a bigger
budget than any he's ever made _ is the football drama ``Any Given
Sunday.'' Al Pacino, as a driven NFL coach, headlines an all-star
cast that includes Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid, Charlton
Heston, James Woods and Ann-Margret, not to mention some real
gridiron veterans, led by recent Hall of Fame inductee Lawrence
Taylor.
 &HT;    Dressed in black pants and a matching T-shirt, his thick black
hair uncombed, Stone looks physically fit but more than a little
distracted.
 &HT;    ``I have over 1,000 digital effects to check before the night is
over,'' he says as he enters a room at Los Angeles' Century Plaza
Hotel. ``Tonight, no matter how late it goes, I will finish this
movie.''
 &HT;    If so, it will be a bright spot in a troubling year.
 &HT;    The 53-year-old director of ``Platoon'' (1986), ``Wall Street''
(1987) and ``JFK'' (1991) was arrested last summer for driving
erratically down a winding Los Angeles road in his black Ford
Mustang. Police found a small amount of hashish in the car, as well
as hydrocodine, a pain medication.
 &HT;    Stone pled guilty to charges of drug possession and received
three years of probation, as well as mandatory enrolment in a
drug-treatment program.
 &HT;    He's also involved in a court case alleging that his ``Natural
Born Killers'' (1994) sparked a real-life murder.
 &HT;    Given that, it probably wasn't too surprising that making his
film about the violent world of football actually led to a call to
the real-life cops. Apparently a shoving match between Jamie Foxx _
who plays an arrogant quarterback _ and co-star LL Cool J
degenerated into a fight, with Foxx ultimately filing and then
dropping assault charges against the rapper.
 &HT;    ``I still shake my head,'' Foxx says in a separate interview,
``because it turned into World Wrestling Federation time. And it
was necessary for the cops to be there.''
 &HT;    And what was the volatile Stone doing while all this was going
on?
 &HT;    Foxx breaks into a laugh.
 &HT;    ``Oliver screamed, `What the hell is going on?''' he says.
```And why aren't my cameras rolling?'''
 &HT;    In short, making an Oliver Stone movie is not for wimps.
Especially if it's about football, a passion since his days
attending Trinity Grammar School in New York.
 &HT;    ``I was a left halfback,'' he says. ``I ripped into people. I
was great, until we moved and I went to a different school. They
moved me to fullback, and I was terrible.
 &HT;    ``Then I stopped playing and took up cross country in protest.''
 &HT;    But football stayed with him all those years.
 &HT;    ``I honestly thought there was something mystical about the
sport,'' he says. ``It reminds me of Indian teachings. I loved how
you literally dig your hands into the earth to get the ball _ there
is something old and primeval about football.''
 &HT;    But the NFL, wary of Stone's penchant for puncturing America's
greatest icons, wasn't buying it.
 &HT;    ``We tried very hard to get their cooperation,'' Stone says. ``I
negotiated with them on and off for months. I went for three or
four meetings, but eventually it just didn't work out.
 &HT;    ``Listen,'' he adds. ``I've never had cooperation from any
official body. Would it be an Oliver Stone film if the Defense
Department had supported `Platoon?' Or `Born on the Fourth of July'
(1989)? Or `Heaven and Earth' (1993)? It's not like the State
Department greeted me warmly about `JFK.'
 &HT;    ``I count on those doors being closed,'' the director says.
``Most of the time I can't go to the real guys, because I want to
tell the truth. I need to be honest.''
 &HT;    And indeed the movie opens an unblinking lens onto the
behind-the-scenes world of professional football _ the greedy
agents, the violent players, the drug-dispensing team doctors, the
exploitative owners and more.
 &HT;    ``You go to the real guys who play and it is about hard hits,
cursing, playing hurt,'' Stone says, pacing the room as his
legendary temper flares. ``A lot of s--t goes down.
 &HT;    ``Of course the NFL doesn't want you to know about anything
behind the scenes,'' he adds, ``because this is supposed to be
family entertainment. They have this Disney image.''
 &HT;    Stone's intensity as a director is matched by Pacino's notorious
intensity as an actor, but he insists that the two had no special
problem working together.
 &HT;    ``I read some phony press account that Al and I were at each
other's throats,'' he says, ``but that is absolutely not true. Al
and I got along very well.''
 &HT;    In fact, he adds, the two have a longstanding relationship
dating back to ``Scarface'' (1983), a Pacino vehicle which Stone
scripted.
 &HT;    ``I wrote `Born on the Fourth of July' for him,'' the director
says. ``Al is a shy man with a sweet inner core. He is also one of
the most sensitive human beings I've ever met. He's one of the best
actors of his generation.''
 &HT;    In a separate interview, Pacino agrees that the two got on
famously.
 &HT;    ``I think what people misunderstand is that Oliver Stone likes
to create chaos on a movie set,'' Pacino says. ``Working with
Oliver is a bit like doing live TV _ it's happening for the first
time and it's happening there. This is it. You're not going to get
a chance to do it again.
 &HT;    ``So it's always good to be ready to meet the day,'' he says.
``You're going to have a lot of surprises.''
 &HT;    Stone also appears briefly in the film as a fashion-challenged
sportscaster _ his first onscreen appearance since a gag cameo as a
conspiracy theorist in ``Dave'' (1993).
 &HT;    ``I was actually planning my own future as a washed-up
sportscaster for when the movie career is done,'' Stone says,
laughing.
 &HT;    ``Any Given Sunday'' may rake its share of NFL muck, but chances
are it won't raise the hackles of the powers that be to the extent
that Stone's Vietnam trilogy and, especially, ``JFK'' and ``Nixon''
(1995) did. Collectively, these films have made the outspokenly
liberal director perhaps the most controversial filmmaker Hollywood
has ever known, and earned him more than his share of enemies in
politics and the media.
 &HT;    ``If you've had success, then you become a bigger target,''
Stone says matter-of-factly. ``It's always nicer to be the underdog
_ I long for the days when I was a younger director and nobody knew
me. Now they watch every move.''
 &HT;    Which doesn't mean he's getting any mellower.
 &HT;    ``Why do I push the envelope? Well, a lot of divorces. A lot of
children,'' he jokes. ``No, I love making movies.
 &HT;    ``Listen,'' Stone says, ``I make hard films, and that hasn't
changed. I still have the energy to make these movies. I am getting
older, so maybe I need to get these movies out of my system before
I make films about people sipping tea.''

 (Includes a color slide of a woodland spirit in a scene from
``Fantasia/2000.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Don't look for Mickey Mouse in the crowd cheering the drop of
the Times Square ball on Dec. 31, or hailing the dawn of a new
millennium on some distant Pacific island.
 &HT;    Instead, Walt Disney's beloved cartoon icon will be hard at
work, pushing a broom across a giant movie screen, accompanied by a
live orchestra, at the gala New Year's Eve premiere of
``Fantasia/2000.''
 &HT;    The new film, an IMAX sequel/revamp to Walt Disney's legendary
animation/classical music hybrid ``Fantasia'' (1940), introduces
seven new sequences _ featuring music by the Chicago Symphony under
conductor James Levine _ and adds star hosts for each sequence,
including Steve Martin, Bette Midler, James Earl Jones and Angela
Lansbury.
 &HT;    Donald Hahn _ who also worked on ``Beauty and the Beast''
(1991), ``The Lion King'' (1994) and ``The Hunchback of Notre
Dame'' (1997) _ clearly relished the opportunity to direct the
celebrity hosts.
 &HT;    ``Being given a chance to take `Fantasia' to a new level is like
being entrusted with the studio's crown jewels,'' he says with an
enthusiastic chuckle. ``What's funny is that Walt was ahead of his
time _ `Fantasia' got mixed reviews and didn't sell a lot of
tickets. Now it seems to end up on everyone's list of best films of
the century.
 &HT;    ``Walt's idea was, `What if we threw together some of the
greatest animation artists and greatest composers in a film without
dialogue?''' Hahn continues. ``Then he had a chat with the famous
conductor Leopold Stokowski, who loved the concept, and they became
a team, with Stokowski taking charge of the music and Disney
coordinating the artists.
 &HT;    ``They began with the sequence with Mickey Mouse, and it just
sort of grew into a feature.''
 &HT;    ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' Mickey's memorable tussle with a
host of enchanted brooms, remains a centerpiece of
``Fantasia/2000.'' His longtime cartoon pal Donald Duck gets into
the act in a Noah's Ark sequence, and the film also introduces
myriad new characters, from animated whales who perform a soaring
aquatic ballet to Respighi's ``Pines of Rome'' to a flock of
flamingos with yo-yos who cavort to the strains of Saint-Saens'
``Carnival of the Animals.''
 &HT;    The choice of the still-new IMAX format was a natural, Hahn
says.
 &HT;    ``Why not?'' he says with a shrug. ``I think it's just breaking
new ground, which is part of the heritage that Walt left behind.
There's never been a feature-length IMAX film. We like to step out
and try things that have never been done before.
 &HT;    ``But there was a tremendous amount of fear in doing it,'' he
admits. ``You start out seeing the characters on a drawing board or
a computer screen, and suddenly they're three stories high _ Mickey
Mouse is as big as a cement truck. I must say that all the images
take on a life of their own when they're that big.''
 &HT;    The original film may be more than a half-century old, but Hahn
thinks its appeal to today's children may be greater than it was
back when.
 &HT;    ``I think kids are more visually literate now than they were in
1940,'' he says. ``Then there wasn't even television, not to
mention MTV. Now there're computers, the Internet and video games _
we have a whole new generation that will see this film with a
different eye.''
 &HT;    The celebrity hosts are more than window-dressing, he adds.
 &HT;    ``I decided to put together an eclectic group who would
represent the diversity of the arts and bring their own style and
personality,'' he says. ``We open `Fantasia/2000' with Steve
Martin, who makes it clear that you're in for more than serious
entertainment _ you're going to have some fun.
 &HT;    ``Steve and the other celebrities will, I think, make the work
of great composers more accessible to the audience.''
 &HT;    Nor are all the hosts clean-cut family entertainers. The honor
of introducing Mickey Mouse fell to the eccentric illusionists Penn
and Teller, known for black humor and offbeat antics.
 &HT;    ``I can tell you they didn't behave themselves,'' Hahn says,
laughing, ``but that made it fun. I knew they'd be irreverent, but
that was the perfect way for them to introduce `The Sorcerer's
Apprentice.'''
 &HT;    On the other hand, Hahn says he's still in awe of James Earl
Jones _ a Disney veteran since ``The Lion King'' _ who introduces
the flamingos with yo-yos.
 &HT;    ``When we had lunch,'' he recalls, ``it was just amazing. He was
ordering his meal in that booming voice of his, and we all felt
like we were at the table with Darth Vader.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to juxtapose that imposing presence of his with what
is a very nutty comical piece,'' Hahn adds. ``He had a great time
doing it.''
 &HT;    Eric Goldberg, a veteran of ``Aladdin'' (1992) and
``Pocahontas'' (1995) who directed the animated-flamingos sequence,
seconds the motion.
 &HT;    ``James Earl Jones could get your attention reading the
telephone book,'' he says. ``I ended up appearing with him in his
introduction. You see me drawing away in the background _ I'm the
short, bearded guy with the pencil. I have to interrupt him and
tell him to change the intro. So now I can say I've acted with
James Earl Jones.''
 &HT;    It was Goldberg who came up with the idea of equipping flamingos
with yo-yos, inspired by Michael Gabriel, his co-director on
``Pocahontas.''
 &HT;    ``Every time Mike would get bored,'' Goldberg recalls, ``he
would pull out his yo-yo and start playing with it. So I shot some
live-action footage of Mike and then turned his right arm into a
flamingo's foot.''
 &HT;    Goldberg also set Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue'' to a story,
set in Jazz Age Manhattan and rendered in the style of the
legendary caricaturist Al Hirschfeld.
 &HT;    ``I was sweating bullets when I had to show the preliminary
drawings to Mr. Hirschfeld,'' he admits. ``He's 92, but as sharp as
ever. He's always been one of my heroes, and I had used his style
when I created the Genie for `Aladdin.' Fortunately he liked that,
and he loved what we did in `Fantasia/2000.'''
 &HT;    The driving force behind the new ``Fantasia,'' both Hahn and
Goldberg say, was Walt Disney's brother Roy, chairman of the
studio's feature-animation division, who was inspired by the
success of the film's early-1990s video release.
 &HT;    ``I always saw Walt's `Fantasia' as a work in progress,'' Disney
says. ``I kept thinking we should do a sequel, but it was always a
dream, not a real possibility. After the success of the video sale,
I asked Michael Eisner if we could fool around a little, and he
said, `Go ahead.'
 &HT;    ``Walt used to say that he felt like a bee that went around
pollinating the various talents at the studio,'' Disney adds. ``I
guess I felt like that's the part I played in `Fantasia/2000.'''
 &HT;    Walt Disney undertook ``Fantasia'' as an artistic statement, one
that he didn't expect to be particularly profitable. While the
studio expects ``Fantasia/2000'' to be successful, the same
aesthetic has driven the new version, and Hahn is confident that
Disney would approve.
 &HT;    ``Sure he would,'' he says. ``He was a great storyteller. In the
end, what really matters is that you go into a dark theater and are
told a tale that moves and engages you. It is what made Shakespeare
great, Dickens great or any storyteller from any generation.
 &HT;    ``That was Walt's genius, and it's reflected in `Fantasia' _ and
I think he'd be proud of the way we've carried on the tradition in
`Fantasia/2000.'''

GOOD WILL HAUNTED: THE TALENTED MATT DAMON TESTS HIS DARK SIDE

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Matt Damon with Gwyneth Paltrow in a
scene from ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Talk about feast or famine.
 &HT;    While filming ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' in Italy, newly minted
superstar Matt Damon spent his days portraying Tom Ripley, a deeply
solitary figure with no self-esteem. Then he'd emerge from his
trailer to the screams of gaggles of young Italian girls shrieking,
``Matt Damon! Matt Damon!''
 &HT;    ``I never really get used to it,'' says Damon, who _ along with
pal Ben Affleck _ swept to fame in 1998 on the Oscar-winning ``Good
Will Hunting'' juggernaut.
 &HT;    ``When Ben and I went to shoot `Dogma' (1999), it was the night
after the Academy Awards,'' he recalls. ``We had to fly to
Pittsburgh, and there were about 10 people waiting at the airport,
which was really strange _ nothing like that had ever happened to
me before.
 &HT;    ``We got off the airplane and we were signing autographs and
taking photos with people,'' he says. ``There was this whole fever
pitch, and then someone from `Dogma' showed up and said, `Let's get
these guys through!' And it seemed almost mobbish for a second.''
 &HT;    The affable Damon, sitting in a suite at Los Angeles' Four
Seasons hotel, shakes his baseball-cap-covered head in lingering
disbelief.
 &HT;    He and Affleck, still trailed by those 10 fans, walked a
quarter-mile to a tram that would shuttle them to the airport's
main terminal, he adds.
 &HT;    ``We got on the tram and these people had to get on the tram,
too,'' Damon says bemusedly. ``By the time we got to our cars, they
were just talking and were not even interested in us anymore.''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``It's this situation that's perpetuated by circumstances,'' he
says thoughtfully. ``When those circumstances are manipulated and
what's normally a 30-second experience turns into a 30-minute
experience, it becomes, `All right, see you, guys!'
 &HT;    ``It was a really interesting study of that whole phenomenon.''
 &HT;    Perhaps coincidentally, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' _ which will
open nationwide on Christmas _ is itself an exploration of the
nature of idolatry, taking it to a jarring, disturbing extreme.
 &HT;    Written and directed by Anthony Minghella, who made the
Oscar-winning ``The English Patient,'' and based on the novel by
Patricia Highsmith, the film casts Damon as Tom Ripley, a
chameleonesque, gay nobody in 1950s New York. The tragic story line
gets underway when a wealthy shipbuilder (James Rebhorn) hires
Ripley to bring home his wayward son Dickie (Jude Law), who, along
with his girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), has been leading the
lush life in Italy.
 &HT;    Dickie's elegant lifestyle so fascinates Ripley that he decides
to achieve it for himself, first by worming his way into Dickie's
favor and then ... well, by any means necessary.
 &HT;    ``We all project a certain amount of happiness on somebody
else's life and make assumptions about other people,'' Damon says.
``I'm certainly guilty of doing it. `Ripley' is a riff on that, but
we play it all the way out.
 &HT;    ``When you start to root for a guy like Ripley,'' he adds, ``and
some people do, you've got to think to yourself, `Well, what does
that say about me?'
 &HT;    ``Hopefully, that question will stay with people after the
lights come back on in the theater,'' Damon says. ``Hopefully,
people will take away the feeling that they're implicated in it
all.
 &HT;    ``In that sense, `Ripley' is a cautionary tale.''
 &HT;    But, since Damon admits that even he started to root for Ripley,
what does that say about him?
 &HT;    ``Exactly,'' he says, breaking into a toothy grin. ``That's why
I had to do the movie. That's why I felt `Ripley' was important, in
terms of the way it goes against the grain of the way movies are
made nowadays.
 &HT;    ```Ripley' really says something,'' the actor adds, ``and its
tone is so original. It was exciting, because I hadn't seen
something like `Ripley' in a long time. Our hero is a very complex
antihero.''
 &HT;    And, it should be noted, Damon delivers a very complex
performance, a well-calibrated one that smartly plays off his
youthful good looks and aw-shucks charm. It's as if the Devil rose
from the pits of Hell and was reborn as the boy next door.
 &HT;    Damon doesn't consider Ripley a despicable character, however.
It's a subtle distinction, but he thinks of him as a guy who
commits despicable acts.
 &HT;    ``The whole challenge of the movie was to keep the audience with
Ripley, not in the sense that they're sympathetic, but in the sense
that they understand what he does,'' the actor says. ``They can
disagree with what he does, but they understand it because they
know where it's coming from, which is this deep loneliness that
this guy (feels).
 &HT;    ``He's so desperately trying not to be alone,'' Damon says,
``and you see that he has this incredible capacity for love, I
think, and sensitivity. He's really far more good to the people
around him than Dickie is.
 &HT;    ``Dickie is very careless, but he just has this incredible
charisma and can leave people totally gobsmacked,'' he adds. ``He's
like the sun, with everyone orbiting around him, but he's totally
oblivious to it. Tom would never treat people that way if he had
Dickie's life.''
 &HT;    Damon's own life has not been the same since ``Good Will
Hunting'' became an unexpected breakout hit a couple of years ago.
The actor, in fact, has spoken often of how he lives out of two
duffel bags that he's dragged from set to set.
 &HT;    After ``Good Will Hunting,'' Damon turned up in ``Rounders''
(1998), then the current ``Dogma'' _ in a role even darker than
Ripley, since he plays a casually murderous renegade angel. Several
other films are already shot, including ``All the Pretty Horses,''
directed by Billy Bob Thornton, and ``The Third Wheel,'' a romantic
comedy, starring Denise Richards and Luke Wilson, which is produced
by Damon and Affleck, who make cameos.
 &HT;    Just completed is ``The Legend of Bagger Vance,'' a Robert
Redford-directed ``fairy tale'' about a golfer (Damon) who has lost
his soul and must be redeemed by a mysterious caddie (Will Smith).
 &HT;    As the holidays approach, Damon is at last slowing down and
catching his breath. At home in his Manhattan apartment, he'll
unpack those well-traveled duffel bags and squeeze in some quality
time with his girlfriend, actress Winona Ryder.
 &HT;    And, despite the high price of fame _ most notably the loss of
anonymity _ Damon intends to count his blessings as the new year
begins. He has no film about to go into production, and he and
Affleck are only now beginning their next script.
 &HT;    ``I'm looking forward to getting a little time to reflect on
everything that's happened to me, because I haven't had that yet,''
he says softly. ``I'll have six months off, and all I'm planning on
doing is writing a script. I think it'll be a good time for me to
reflect and spend time with my family and friends.
 &HT;    ``But I can't think of anything I'd want to be different right
now.''

OLIVER STONE: THE SAME OLD GAME ON A WHOLE NEW FIELD

 (Includes a color slide of Oliver Stone directing Al Pacino and

 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The ball is in Oliver Stone's hands and the clock is ticking
down.
 &HT;    The people at Warner Bros. are rooting for a touchdown, and the
pressure is on.
 &HT;    ``There is such a level of intensity before I release a film
that I've actually had to develop a skin as tough as a football,''
Stone says.
 &HT;    The football metaphors come naturally to the director, taking
time out for an interview before diving back into the massive task
of getting his latest film edited in time for its Dec. 22 opening.
 &HT;    That film _ which, at $55 million and counting, has a bigger
budget than any he's ever made _ is the football drama ``Any Given
Sunday.'' Al Pacino, as a driven NFL coach, headlines an all-star
cast that includes Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid, Charlton
Heston, James Woods and Ann-Margret, not to mention some real
gridiron veterans, led by recent Hall of Fame inductee Lawrence
Taylor.
 &HT;    Dressed in black pants and a matching T-shirt, his thick black
hair uncombed, Stone looks physically fit but more than a little
distracted.
 &HT;    ``I have over 1,000 digital effects to check before the night is
over,'' he says as he enters a room at Los Angeles' Century Plaza
Hotel. ``Tonight, no matter how late it goes, I will finish this
movie.''
 &HT;    If so, it will be a bright spot in a troubling year.
 &HT;    The 53-year-old director of ``Platoon'' (1986), ``Wall Street''
(1987) and ``JFK'' (1991) was arrested last summer for driving
erratically down a winding Los Angeles road in his black Ford
Mustang. Police found a small amount of hashish in the car, as well
as hydrocodine, a pain medication.
 &HT;    Stone pled guilty to charges of drug possession and received
three years of probation, as well as mandatory enrolment in a
drug-treatment program.
 &HT;    He's also involved in a court case alleging that his ``Natural
Born Killers'' (1994) sparked a real-life murder.
 &HT;    Given that, it probably wasn't too surprising that making his
film about the violent world of football actually led to a call to
the real-life cops. Apparently a shoving match between Jamie Foxx _
who plays an arrogant quarterback _ and co-star LL Cool J
degenerated into a fight, with Foxx ultimately filing and then
dropping assault charges against the rapper.
 &HT;    ``I still shake my head,'' Foxx says in a separate interview,
``because it turned into World Wrestling Federation time. And it
was necessary for the cops to be there.''
 &HT;    And what was the volatile Stone doing while all this was going
on?
 &HT;    Foxx breaks into a laugh.
 &HT;    ``Oliver screamed, `What the hell is going on?''' he says.
```And why aren't my cameras rolling?'''
 &HT;    In short, making an Oliver Stone movie is not for wimps.
Especially if it's about football, a passion since his days
attending Trinity Grammar School in New York.
 &HT;    ``I was a left halfback,'' he says. ``I ripped into people. I
was great, until we moved and I went to a different school. They
moved me to fullback, and I was terrible.
 &HT;    ``Then I stopped playing and took up cross country in protest.''
 &HT;    But football stayed with him all those years.
 &HT;    ``I honestly thought there was something mystical about the
sport,'' he says. ``It reminds me of Indian teachings. I loved how
you literally dig your hands into the earth to get the ball _ there
is something old and primeval about football.''
 &HT;    But the NFL, wary of Stone's penchant for puncturing America's
greatest icons, wasn't buying it.
 &HT;    ``We tried very hard to get their cooperation,'' Stone says. ``I
negotiated with them on and off for months. I went for three or
four meetings, but eventually it just didn't work out.
 &HT;    ``Listen,'' he adds. ``I've never had cooperation from any
official body. Would it be an Oliver Stone film if the Defense
Department had supported `Platoon?' Or `Born on the Fourth of July'
(1989)? Or `Heaven and Earth' (1993)? It's not like the State
Department greeted me warmly about `JFK.'
 &HT;    ``I count on those doors being closed,'' the director says.
``Most of the time I can't go to the real guys, because I want to
tell the truth. I need to be honest.''
 &HT;    And indeed the movie opens an unblinking lens onto the
behind-the-scenes world of professional football _ the greedy
agents, the violent players, the drug-dispensing team doctors, the
exploitative owners and more.
 &HT;    ``You go to the real guys who play and it is about hard hits,
cursing, playing hurt,'' Stone says, pacing the room as his
legendary temper flares. ``A lot of s--t goes down.
 &HT;    ``Of course the NFL doesn't want you to know about anything
behind the scenes,'' he adds, ``because this is supposed to be
family entertainment. They have this Disney image.''
 &HT;    Stone's intensity as a director is matched by Pacino's notorious
intensity as an actor, but he insists that the two had no special
problem working together.
 &HT;    ``I read some phony press account that Al and I were at each
other's throats,'' he says, ``but that is absolutely not true. Al
and I got along very well.''
 &HT;    In fact, he adds, the two have a longstanding relationship
dating back to ``Scarface'' (1983), a Pacino vehicle which Stone
scripted.
 &HT;    ``I wrote `Born on the Fourth of July' for him,'' the director
says. ``Al is a shy man with a sweet inner core. He is also one of
the most sensitive human beings I've ever met. He's one of the best
actors of his generation.''
 &HT;    In a separate interview, Pacino agrees that the two got on
famously.
 &HT;    ``I think what people misunderstand is that Oliver Stone likes
to create chaos on a movie set,'' Pacino says. ``Working with
Oliver is a bit like doing live TV _ it's happening for the first
time and it's happening there. This is it. You're not going to get
a chance to do it again.
 &HT;    ``So it's always good to be ready to meet the day,'' he says.
``You're going to have a lot of surprises.''
 &HT;    Stone also appears briefly in the film as a fashion-challenged
sportscaster _ his first onscreen appearance since a gag cameo as a
conspiracy theorist in ``Dave'' (1993).
 &HT;    ``I was actually planning my own future as a washed-up
sportscaster for when the movie career is done,'' Stone says,
laughing.
 &HT;    ``Any Given Sunday'' may rake its share of NFL muck, but chances
are it won't raise the hackles of the powers that be to the extent
that Stone's Vietnam trilogy and, especially, ``JFK'' and ``Nixon''
(1995) did. Collectively, these films have made the outspokenly
liberal director perhaps the most controversial filmmaker Hollywood
has ever known, and earned him more than his share of enemies in
politics and the media.
 &HT;    ``If you've had success, then you become a bigger target,''
Stone says matter-of-factly. ``It's always nicer to be the underdog
_ I long for the days when I was a younger director and nobody knew
me. Now they watch every move.''
 &HT;    Which doesn't mean he's getting any mellower.
 &HT;    ``Why do I push the envelope? Well, a lot of divorces. A lot of
children,'' he jokes. ``No, I love making movies.
 &HT;    ``Listen,'' Stone says, ``I make hard films, and that hasn't
changed. I still have the energy to make these movies. I am getting
older, so maybe I need to get these movies out of my system before
I make films about people sipping tea.''

MICKEY MOUSE, MUSIC AND THE MILLENNIUM: `FANTASIA/2000' HITS THE
BIG, BIG SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of a woodland spirit in a scene from
``Fantasia/2000.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Don't look for Mickey Mouse in the crowd cheering the drop of
the Times Square ball on Dec. 31, or hailing the dawn of a new
millennium on some distant Pacific island.
 &HT;    Instead, Walt Disney's beloved cartoon icon will be hard at
work, pushing a broom across a giant movie screen, accompanied by a
live orchestra, at the gala New Year's Eve premiere of
``Fantasia/2000.''
 &HT;    The new film, an IMAX sequel/revamp to Walt Disney's legendary
animation/classical music hybrid ``Fantasia'' (1940), introduces
seven new sequences _ featuring music by the Chicago Symphony under
conductor James Levine _ and adds star hosts for each sequence,
including Steve Martin, Bette Midler, James Earl Jones and Angela
Lansbury.
 &HT;    Donald Hahn _ who also worked on ``Beauty and the Beast''
(1991), ``The Lion King'' (1994) and ``The Hunchback of Notre
Dame'' (1997) _ clearly relished the opportunity to direct the
celebrity hosts.
 &HT;    ``Being given a chance to take `Fantasia' to a new level is like
being entrusted with the studio's crown jewels,'' he says with an
enthusiastic chuckle. ``What's funny is that Walt was ahead of his
time _ `Fantasia' got mixed reviews and didn't sell a lot of
tickets. Now it seems to end up on everyone's list of best films of
the century.
 &HT;    ``Walt's idea was, `What if we threw together some of the
greatest animation artists and greatest composers in a film without
dialogue?''' Hahn continues. ``Then he had a chat with the famous
conductor Leopold Stokowski, who loved the concept, and they became
a team, with Stokowski taking charge of the music and Disney
coordinating the artists.
 &HT;    ``They began with the sequence with Mickey Mouse, and it just
sort of grew into a feature.''
 &HT;    ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' Mickey's memorable tussle with a
host of enchanted brooms, remains a centerpiece of
``Fantasia/2000.'' His longtime cartoon pal Donald Duck gets into
the act in a Noah's Ark sequence, and the film also introduces
myriad new characters, from animated whales who perform a soaring
aquatic ballet to Respighi's ``Pines of Rome'' to a flock of
flamingos with yo-yos who cavort to the strains of Saint-Saens'
``Carnival of the Animals.''
 &HT;    The choice of the still-new IMAX format was a natural, Hahn
says.
 &HT;    ``Why not?'' he says with a shrug. ``I think it's just breaking
new ground, which is part of the heritage that Walt left behind.
There's never been a feature-length IMAX film. We like to step out
and try things that have never been done before.
 &HT;    ``But there was a tremendous amount of fear in doing it,'' he
admits. ``You start out seeing the characters on a drawing board or
a computer screen, and suddenly they're three stories high _ Mickey
Mouse is as big as a cement truck. I must say that all the images
take on a life of their own when they're that big.''
 &HT;    The original film may be more than a half-century old, but Hahn
thinks its appeal to today's children may be greater than it was
back when.
 &HT;    ``I think kids are more visually literate now than they were in
1940,'' he says. ``Then there wasn't even television, not to
mention MTV. Now there're computers, the Internet and video games _
we have a whole new generation that will see this film with a
different eye.''
 &HT;    The celebrity hosts are more than window-dressing, he adds.
 &HT;    ``I decided to put together an eclectic group who would
represent the diversity of the arts and bring their own style and
personality,'' he says. ``We open `Fantasia/2000' with Steve
Martin, who makes it clear that you're in for more than serious
entertainment _ you're going to have some fun.
 &HT;    ``Steve and the other celebrities will, I think, make the work
of great composers more accessible to the audience.''
 &HT;    Nor are all the hosts clean-cut family entertainers. The honor
of introducing Mickey Mouse fell to the eccentric illusionists Penn
and Teller, known for black humor and offbeat antics.
 &HT;    ``I can tell you they didn't behave themselves,'' Hahn says,
laughing, ``but that made it fun. I knew they'd be irreverent, but
that was the perfect way for them to introduce `The Sorcerer's
Apprentice.'''
 &HT;    On the other hand, Hahn says he's still in awe of James Earl
Jones _ a Disney veteran since ``The Lion King'' _ who introduces
the flamingos with yo-yos.
 &HT;    ``When we had lunch,'' he recalls, ``it was just amazing. He was
ordering his meal in that booming voice of his, and we all felt
like we were at the table with Darth Vader.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to juxtapose that imposing presence of his with what
is a very nutty comical piece,'' Hahn adds. ``He had a great time
doing it.''
 &HT;    Eric Goldberg, a veteran of ``Aladdin'' (1992) and
``Pocahontas'' (1995) who directed the animated-flamingos sequence,
seconds the motion.
 &HT;    ``James Earl Jones could get your attention reading the
telephone book,'' he says. ``I ended up appearing with him in his
introduction. You see me drawing away in the background _ I'm the
short, bearded guy with the pencil. I have to interrupt him and
tell him to change the intro. So now I can say I've acted with
James Earl Jones.''
 &HT;    It was Goldberg who came up with the idea of equipping flamingos
with yo-yos, inspired by Michael Gabriel, his co-director on
``Pocahontas.''
 &HT;    ``Every time Mike would get bored,'' Goldberg recalls, ``he
would pull out his yo-yo and start playing with it. So I shot some
live-action footage of Mike and then turned his right arm into a
flamingo's foot.''
 &HT;    Goldberg also set Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue'' to a story,
set in Jazz Age Manhattan and rendered in the style of the
legendary caricaturist Al Hirschfeld.
 &HT;    ``I was sweating bullets when I had to show the preliminary
drawings to Mr. Hirschfeld,'' he admits. ``He's 92, but as sharp as
ever. He's always been one of my heroes, and I had used his style
when I created the Genie for `Aladdin.' Fortunately he liked that,
and he loved what we did in `Fantasia/2000.'''
 &HT;    The driving force behind the new ``Fantasia,'' both Hahn and
Goldberg say, was Walt Disney's brother Roy, chairman of the
studio's feature-animation division, who was inspired by the
success of the film's early-1990s video release.
 &HT;    ``I always saw Walt's `Fantasia' as a work in progress,'' Disney
says. ``I kept thinking we should do a sequel, but it was always a
dream, not a real possibility. After the success of the video sale,
I asked Michael Eisner if we could fool around a little, and he
said, `Go ahead.'
 &HT;    ``Walt used to say that he felt like a bee that went around
pollinating the various talents at the studio,'' Disney adds. ``I
guess I felt like that's the part I played in `Fantasia/2000.'''
 &HT;    Walt Disney undertook ``Fantasia'' as an artistic statement, one
that he didn't expect to be particularly profitable. While the
studio expects ``Fantasia/2000'' to be successful, the same
aesthetic has driven the new version, and Hahn is confident that
Disney would approve.
 &HT;    ``Sure he would,'' he says. ``He was a great storyteller. In the
end, what really matters is that you go into a dark theater and are
told a tale that moves and engages you. It is what made Shakespeare
great, Dickens great or any storyteller from any generation.
 &HT;    ``That was Walt's genius, and it's reflected in `Fantasia' _ and
I think he'd be proud of the way we've carried on the tradition in
`Fantasia/2000.'''

THE ULTIMATE MILLENNIUM BUG
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL DAVIS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Call it the millennium bed bug.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists say an unprecedented collision of traditional
holiday worries and intense pressure to make this New Year's Eve a
once-in-a-lifetime event may lead to more fizzle than sizzle
between the sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Just like some computers will be betrayed by their own
microchips at midnight on Jan. 1, 2000, some people's intentions
are likely to be thwarted by certain body parts at a crucial
romantic moment.
</P>
<P>
   New York sex therapist Dr. Judy Kuriansky calls it ``your own
little Y2K meltdown.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no research to back up this latest Y2K worry (food and
shelter were more pressing concerns than good sex in A.D. 1000),
but mental health experts say it's no stretch to anticipate
widespread sexual frustration as couples strive to conceive a
millennium baby, or make an earthshaking intimate connection to
mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the anxieties the millennium is causing, it could
certainly get into the bedroom, too,'' said Dr. Irving Berkovitz, a
professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Los
Angeles. ``Any stress can affect performance in the bedroom. If
that person is stressed by the millennium or Christmas or what have
you, it's going to affect them. Men, as you may or may not know,
are very susceptible to performance anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember Dan Jansen, the star U.S. speed skater. Going in as a
favorite, his slips and mental miscues in three Olympics earned him
the title of ``the most pitied athlete in America'' until he
recovered his poise and won a gold medal in his last event in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The most memorable New Year's Eve in 1,000 years may be the
sexual equivalent of the Olympics. Companies are pushing romance _
diamonds, champagne, amorous getaways _ like never before, and
couples got busy back in April to produce the first baby of 2000.
There's also a hint of danger, which is always a good excuse for
people to get intimate. (Hospitals reported nearly double the
number of births nine months after the New York blackout of Nov. 9,
1965. Of course, television was also off the air, which may explain
it.)
</P>
<P>
   Holidays also are ``marker dates,'' special times that can
increase emotions _ good and bad _ exponentially. And the
millennium is the mother of all marker dates, a time with promises
of both spectacular revelry and apocalyptic chaos. Toss in the
millennium computer glitch, also known as the Y2K bug, which may
cause some computers to think its 1900 and crash, and 11:59 p.m. on
Dec. 31, 1999, promises to be a pretty interesting moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to be playing harder, traveling more than
they're accustomed to _ and they're also going to expect to have
sexual relations,'' said Linda Fazio, a professor who specializes
in sex and disabilities at the University of Southern California.
``The celebration of the millennium is a time to indulge all the
physical pleasures you can engage in _ at least that's what I'm
hearing people say.''
</P>
<P>
   That coupling of tension and great expectations can kill sex
drive like a cold shower. Traditional holiday blues _ finances,
forced merriment and strained family relations _ further set the
stage for sexual frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that cause inability to perform frequently are the
things that go along with the holidays _ too much alcohol, not
sleeping enough, trying to have sex when you're under a lot of
tension,'' Fazio said. ``I think people are going to be
disappointed. Anything people try to do as a one-time event is
going to lead to some kind of disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Jansen's mental demons overwhelmed his stellar skating
abilities, the mind can be equally wicked when it comes to sex _
especially for men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation in (a man's) head is, 'I'm supposed to perform
here,' and that creates anxiety, which physically shifts the body
into a fight-or-flight response,'' said Kuriansky, a clinical
psychologist who hosts a radio show in New York City. The body
shifts crucial blood and hormones to areas devoted to self-defense.
That leaves nothing left for sex.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, the millennium could be a massive turn-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, people could think of this as the first day of
the rest of their lives,'' Fazio said. ``The year 2000 is a time to
start over, and that might alleviate some concerns. They might feel
that they can start again _ clean slate.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, even if the millennium bed bug strikes, it's a
glitch with an easy fix.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, don't expect the earth to move. And, if it really
doesn't, the key to recovery is knowing it's all in your mind,
Kuriansky said. Relax, laugh it off and keep snuggling. Think like
Jansen and wait for the chance to try, try again.
</P>
<P>
   It took Jansen 10 years to win his medal. Lovers who handle a
sexual glitch with humor and calm will likely have to wait only a
few minutes for their reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys run from it, hide or withdraw instantly,'' Kuriansky
said. ``Don't blame yourself, recognize there are things creating
pressure at that moment, which should take the pressure off. Make a
joke of it with your partner. Say, 'Oh my goodness, the millennial
meltdowm is happening to me.' Humor takes pressure off. Sharing
with your partner, if you have that kind of relationship, also
takes pressure off and allows acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay with the desire to be together, and it will return,'' she
continued. ``Focus on another part of your body for a while. Focus
on the love.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to create the millennium baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: The best solution is not to think too much about
it, which, of course, may be impossible to do now that you know
about it. &QL;

PERSONAL-HEALTH: THIS BUG CAN MAKE YOU, AND YOUR PET, SICK
PUPPIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lurking in the guts of many pets and people is a sneaky parasite
that may well be the most common cause of gastrointestinal distress
in this and many other countries. The organism, a protozoan called
giardia (pronounced jee-AR-dee-ya), is easy to acquire but hard to
diagnose and often difficult to treat effectively. It can cause no
symptoms at all or it can turn its host into one sick puppy
suffering from abdominal cramps, diarrhea and weight loss. It may
even result in food allergies. In its various forms, giardia can
infect most vertebrates, but one form, Giardia lamblia, has a
particular penchant for mammals, including dogs, cats, livestock
and people.
</P>
<P>
   Giardiasis (jee-ar-DYE-uh-sis), as the disease caused by giardia
protozoa is called, was first named beaver fever, for an outbreak
in Canada traced to water that was contaminated by the excrement of
beavers.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of giardia contamination by beavers and other
wild mammals is the main reason campers and hikers are warned
against drinking water from even the most pristine mountain
streams. Clear, clean water actually fosters the survival of the
cysts that are the infectious form of the giardia parasite, whereas
competition from bacteria in contaminated water hampers their
survival.
</P>
<P>
   People and pets commonly get giardiasis from swallowing water
from streams, lakes, ponds, puddles and even swimming pools, which
rarely have enough disinfecting chemicals to kill the resistant
cysts. Even city water supplies sometimes become contaminated with
giardia when filter systems break down, resulting in widespread
community outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   Boiling water for 10 minutes or filtering it can effectively
cleanse it of giardia cysts, but they are tough, surviving for more
than two months in water at 46 degrees and about one month in
70-degree water. In a recent report, a committee of the National
Research Council noted that giardia and another waterborne
pathogen, cryptosporidium, are very resistant to the chlorination
process used to disinfect city water and recommended that New York
City start filtering its water supply. The current approach of
watershed management would not prevent pathogens like giardia cysts
from contaminating city water, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Once giardia cysts are swallowed, acids in the stomach and
enzymes from the pancreas cause them to burst open and release the
parasitic phase called a trophozoite (trof-uh-ZO-ite), which
attaches itself to the lining of the small intestine where digested
foods are normally absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed under a microscope, trophozoites are rather adorable _
enlarged and stuffed, they would make an attractive toy with a
rounded body with two eyes (the nuclei), four arms and four legs
(the flagella).
</P>
<P>
   But to someone with a symptomatic infection, they are anything
but cute. Once attached to the intestines, they can multiply
rapidly, dividing every 12 hours so that a single trophozoite could
potentially become a million in just 10 days and a billion in 15
days.
</P>
<P>
   The organisms reduce the surface area of the intestines and
impede the absorption of nutrients and water, resulting in
malabsorption, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and sometimes vomiting
and fever. Veterinarians report that dogs sometimes develop food
allergies because the giardia-infected gut becomes more permeable
and allows incompletely digested food proteins to pass through.
</P>
<P>
   After some weeks, the trophozoites form cysts that are
intermittently excreted in the feces into environments where other
animals, people or the original source can accidentally ingest
them. Pet dogs, even city dogs, often become infected and
reinfected with giardia and recent studies have indicated that
people can catch giardiasis from their pets. Cysts may be present
on a pet's coat hairs and may be transferred to its owner via a
loving hand or the pet's tongue after it has been grooming.
</P>
<P>
   Pets from shelters, pet stores or breeders and those boarded in
kennels have the highest rates of giardia infections.
</P>
<P>
   The infection is not always obvious. A study by veterinarians at
the University of California at Davis of randomly collected fecal
samples from 117 healthy puppies revealed that 36 percent of the
animals were infected. The disease is most serious in puppies, old
dogs and those with weakened immune systems. Likewise in people:
small children, the elderly and those with compromised immunity are
at greatest risk of suffering a debilitating infection.
</P>
<P>
   People are most often infected by one another, especially in
institutional settings like day care centers and homes for the
elderly where hygiene may be less than ideal. People, like pets,
can be Typhoid Marys, passing along the organism to others but
suffering no symptoms themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As common and unmistakable as the giardia parasite is, it is
nonetheless often difficult to diagnose. Since the cysts are
excreted only from time to time and trophozoites even less often,
analyzing just one or two fecal samples may miss them.
Parasitologists recommend repeated stool examinations or analysis
of a sample of the intestinal contents.
</P>
<P>
   The trophozoites or cysts can sometimes be seen under a
microscope, but immunological tests that detect proteins from the
parasite are most effective for making an accurate diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   But veterinarians commonly use a far less accurate test.
Veterinary experts say that unless the stool sample is floated in a
zinc sulfate solution and then strained and centrifuged, it is very
easy to miss the giardia parasite.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment is another problem. There is none known that is 100
percent effective, and all the drugs that kill giardia have nasty
side effects. The most commonly used drug is metronidazole
(Flagyl), which may cause nausea and vomiting, headache, abdominal
cramps, a sharp, metallic taste in the mouth or a secondary yeast
infection. Less common but more serious side effects include
seizures and numbness and tingling in the arms, legs, hands and
feet. Further complicating treatment is that some giardia organisms
have developed resistance to Flagyl.
</P>
<P>
   For treatment of a pet and pet owners to have a lasting effect,
it is crucial to prevent reinfection. First, if a pet has been
given a diagnosis of giardiasis, those in close contact with the
animal, and especially any children in the household, might also be
tested.
</P>
<P>
   Even a pet under treatment will continue to excrete cysts for a
time. If the pet has diarrhea, it may get cysts on its coat and
should be bathed. If the pet deposits feces in the yard, they must
be picked up as soon as possible. Hands should be washed after
scooping the feces or touching the animal and before handling food.
Try to keep your pet away from potentially contaminated water
sources.
</P>
<P>
   A recently licensed vaccine, GiardiaVax, by Fort Dodge, given
annually may help prevent giardia infection in dogs, but there is
still no equivalent preventive for people.

GENETICISTS TAP SECRETS OF `THE WEED' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biologists have decoded a large part of the DNA of a plant,
affording the first glimpse of the genetic programming of the plant
world.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, known formally as Arabidopsis thaliana and informally
as ``the weed,'' is studied by nearly a thousand laboratories
around the world as a model plant.
</P>
<P>
   One immediate surprise is that Arabidopsis, which scientists
chose to decode because of its small and simple genome, turns out
to have some 25,000 genes, considerably more than the C. elegans
roundworm, whose full DNA or genome was decoded last year.
</P>
<P>
   This may give ``weed people,'' as those who study Arabidopsis
are sometimes known, unexpected bragging rights over worm people.
</P>
<P>
   Several large consortiums of scientists were formed to work on
Arabidopsis' five chromosomes, the units in which its DNA is
packaged. The first two of these chromosomes have now been decoded,
scientists reported last week in Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville, Md., has
obtained the DNA sequence of Chromosome 2, and a consortium of
European and American groups has sequenced Chromosome 4.
</P>
<P>
   These two chromosomes, two of the smallest, represent about a
quarter of the plant's total genome. They show that large parts of
the genome consist of duplications, with the identical sequence of
DNA letters appearing twice over.
</P>
<P>
   The duplications, arising through errors in the copying process
when a cell divides, are thought to play a major innovative role in
evolution, since the new spare copy of a gene is free to evolve new
functions.
</P>
<P>
   This first glimpse ``shows a remarkably dynamic genome, one in
constant motion and undergoing constant rearrangement,'' Dr.
Elliott M. Meyerowitz of Caltech wrote in a commentary in Nature.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of the sequenced chromosomes, Arabidopsis is
calculated to possess 25,000 genes. It is hard to see why it needs
so many, given that a mere 19,000 genes suffice to run the
roundworm, which has a brain and nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should underestimate the complexities of
flowering plants,'' said Dr. Michael Bevan, a biologist at the John
Innes Center in Norwich, England, and a leader of a Chromosome 4
team. ``They have an enormous repertoire of genes for elaborating a
vast variety of chemicals from sunlight, air and water, and they
have very sophisticated defense mechanisms because they cannot
fight or run away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative, which oversees the decoding
work, hopes to complete much of the genome by the end of 2000.
Having the first complete plant genome in hand should make it much
easier to improve the genetics of crops. Bevan said genes from
Arabidopsis could be effective when transferred to crop plants
because ``a lot of these processes are conserved between different
plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the biologists who decoded the first human chromosome this
month, the Arabidopsis biologists were baffled by the part of the
chromosome known as the centromere. This region of DNA, important
in helping to distribute dividing chromosomes equally between two
daughter cells, is made of the same short run of DNA letters
repeated over and over again. The repetitions, like identical
pieces of a jigsaw, are very hard to reassemble correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The centromere has ``one part that we just do not technically
have the capability to sequence,'' said W. Richard McCombie, a
member of the Chromosome 4 team at the Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory. The team sequenced as far into the centromere as it
could go and hopes to finish the rest when technology improves,
McCombie said.

THE COMMAND THAT LETS YOU EAT YOUR INTERNET WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 26)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. The words LESS THAN
and GREATER THAN in parentheses should be replaced by the
symbols.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Another damned, thick, square book!'' said the duke of
Gloucester in 1781 to a hard-working historian, Edward Gibbon,
whose ``Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' would ultimately run
to six damned, thick, square volumes. ``Always  &UR; scribble &LR; ,
 &UR; scribble &LR; ,  &UR; scribble &LR; , eh, Mr. Gibbon?''
</P>
<P>
   That was the most famous use of a word that means ``to write
hastily, often illegibly,'' rooted in the Latin  &UR; scribere &LR; , ``to
write.'' A  &UR; scrivener &LR;  is a public copyist, but that noun has
fallen into disuse except among notaries public; a  &UR; scribe &LR; , once
``a copyist of biblical texts,'' is now used jocularly to mean
``journalist,'' and a  &UR; scribbler &LR;  is a put-down of a writer. This
eye-strained wretch, in the millennial winter of his discontent,
can be found down in the subbasement of information architecture in
a cubicle labeled  &UR; content provider &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   But the noun and verb  &UR; scribble &LR;  has been resuscitated by the
Internet set and given a new command position. In ``Wired Style,''
by Constance Hale and Jessie Scanlon, the  &UR; scribble command &LR;  is a
boon to  &UR; flame-throwers &LR;  _ those intemperate types who post curses
on bulletin boards and otherwise abuse the civility of computer
intercourse: `` &UR; Scribbling &LR;  ... the saving grace of flame-throwers
on the Well, the  &UR; scribble &LR;  command lets posters delete their words
after the fact. The original post is replaced by a (LESS
THAN) &UR; scribbled &LR; (GREATER THAN) notice. It lets you eat your words,
but not without leaving some digital crumbs.''
</P>
<P>
   If you have second thoughts about some snarl you have posted on
the Well, a members-only Sausalito, Calif., ``online community,''
where this 1985 PicoSpan software was first used, you can delete it
with the  &UR; scribble &LR;  command. The post time, date and user name will
be listed, but the text of the heated message will be replaced by
the word  &UR; scribbled &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   What a great idea. Our civilization would neither decline nor
fall if only we could work out a mental eraser that would scratch
out insults we wish we had never hurled. Thanks to Internetese, at
last self-expurgation has a moniker _ eh, Mr. Gibbon?
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S PAST MUST NOT BE PRELUDE
</P>
<P>
   It is time to get right with the old millennium. In the course
of the last thousand years, and especially in 1999, I have made a
few mistakes that I want to get off my conscience so I can start
with a clean slate.
</P>
<P>
   In a jeremiad denouncing ``shoppertainment'' in factory-outlet
malls, I wrote: ``Standing here in the epicenter of
pre-Christmasism, laden with shopping bags of merchandise that
proves my worth both as a provider and conspicuous consumer, a
nagging thought intrudes: Is this the way I want to spend my
leisure time?''
</P>
<P>
   As Robert Peyser of Brookline, Mass., writes, ``Might you not
agree that the participial phrase beginning with the words
`Standing here' ought to modify `I'?'' I might. That was a double
dangling participle _ hard to do _ and it would be wrong to let it
slop over to 2000. Should have written: ``... consumer, I was
struck by the thought ....''
</P>
<P>
   In a factual lapse, I misinformed readers that Al Capone ``died
in jail _ `nutty as a fruitcake,' as a gangland visitor reported.''
A mob of his Chicago followers pointed out that their hero,
Scarface Al, died of cardiac arrest in 1947 at his Palm Island,
Fla., home after being released from jail (but _ as reported
accurately here _ nutty as a fruitcake).
</P>
<P>
   ``The 50 American states are not sovereign,'' I wrote in a
column that sought to explicate the exquisite difference between
 &UR; state &LR;  and  &UR; nation &LR; , ``no matter what they say in Texas and Hawaii
(the only states that were once sovereign nations).''
</P>
<P>
   An indignant troop of Ethan Allen's Green Mountain Boys came
after me on that one. ( &UR; Vermont &LR;  means ``green mountain.'') From
1777 to 1791, the settlers of the New Hampshire Grants, as Vermont
was first known, refused to consider themselves part of neighboring
New York and functioned as an independent nation, issuing their own
money and telling the 13 states forming a union to take a hike.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the feisty Vermonters paid greedy New York $30,000 to
drop its claim, which paved the way for it to become the 14th
state. Sen. James Jeffords, on behalf of his incensed constituents,
was especially worked up about my error, and I hope this does not
start a secession movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Gotcha! Gang follows me from these pages to television
appearances. I was heard to say  &UR; congratulate &LR;  and  &UR; accreditate &LR;  as
if those words had no  &UR; t &LR;  (except the one in  &UR; ate &LR; ), but only a
 &UR; d &LR; . Leslie Hill-Levitt Latham of West Redding, Conn., wondered if
this frequent mispronunciation would lead to a change in spelling
to  &UR; congradulate &LR;  and  &UR; accredidate &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Hats off to  &UR; congratulations &LR;  _ the word is impossible to
pronounce correctly. When a  &UR; d &LR;  or a  &UR; t &LR;  comes between two vowels,
what linguists call ``flapping'' takes place, and we hear the sound
of  &UR; d/t &LR;  or  &UR; t/d &LR; , an amalgam of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, as Ellen Kaisse, professor of linguistics at the
University of Washington (Seattle), notes, ``The  &UR; y &LR;  sound before
the  &UR; u &LR;  makes the consonant  &UR; t/d &LR;  sound more like  &UR; ch/j &LR; , and
people pronounce this word in about three ways:  &UR; congradyulate, &LR; 
 &UR; congrachulate &LR;  or  &UR; congrajulate &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   What's a kudos-giver to do? I will adopt slang's shortened noun
form,  &UR; congrats &LR; , but will still struggle along with the word I
pronounce  &UR; congradulate &LR;  as a verb. However, I will not adopt that
spelling, preferring to stick with the  &UR; t &LR;  for old times' sake. (As
for the mispronounced and misspelled verb  &UR; accredidate &LR; , I'll
strike it from my mental set; the verb is ``to accredit.'')
</P>
<P>
   And as for those lifting a glass at the big hooh-hah in a few
days: a festive, neatly snipped-off, easily pronounceable and
correctly spellable  &UR; congrats &LR;  to one and all.

FILIPINO VETERANS WIN A BATTLE, BUT NOT THE WAR, FOR EQUITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Having lived for 85 years _ as an elementary
school teacher, a Filipino guerrilla fighter, a sharpshooter for
the U.S. Army and now a stooped, slow-moving man who only
occasionally wanders outside his San Francisco apartment _ Ernesto
Fajardo's thoughts have turned to his funeral arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   If he dies in his adopted homeland, where he has been living as
a U.S. citizen for eight years, ``we don't have the money to pay
for the transportation of my dead body back to the Philippines.''
</P>
<P>
   If death takes him in his hometown of Mayantoc, about 70 miles
from Manila, ``The whole town will be attending my funeral. I am a
bandleader, so the band will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the end is near, Fajardo had his boxes packed and was
waiting for President Clinton to sign a bill that would allow him
to continue receiving benefits while spending the rest of his days
in his native country.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, he got the good news from a friend who dropped
by: Clinton had signed the Foster Care Independence Act, which
included a rider allowing Filipino veterans of World War II who
receive Supplemental Security income (SSI) to return to the
Philippines and still get 75 percent of those monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the bottom of my heart, I am thanking the president for
his benevolence and his Christmas gift,'' he said, his words coming
out slowly, but each one loud and distinct.
</P>
<P>
   However, only a fraction of the 14,000 Filipino veterans
eligible under this provision are expected to take advantage of it.
The ever-declining number of aging Filipino veterans _ now
estimated at 50,000 to 70,000 _ have spent 53 years waiting for the
U.S. government to give them the same medical, pension and burial
benefits as American soldiers, which they believe the U.S.
government promised them when the war broke out in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Such legislation has been proposed in Congress, but to date has
not been approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This SSI is just a drop in the bucket,'' said Jon Melegrito,
executive director of the National Federation of Filipino American
Associations in Washington, D.C. ``It doesn't cost the United
States anything. In fact, it saves them money.''
</P>
<P>
   By taking the reduced SSI payments, which would be up to $380 a
month, and agreeing to give up Medicaid, the veterans would save
the U.S. government an estimated $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is pleased some veterans will benefit from the law,
Melegrito said he had misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is, by passing this legislation, it doesn't give
Congress any incentive to pursue the Filipino veterans equity
bill,'' he said. ``We've been fighting for that for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Eric Lachica, executive director of the American
Coalition for Filipino Veterans, sees it, the SSI provision is just
the first step in the fight for equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Round One,'' said Lachica, the Washington lobbyist
behind the provision. ``It inspires our supporters to get
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Philippines was still a U.S. commonwealth, about
200,000 Filipino soldiers were drafted into the war against the
Japanese. They say they were promised citizenship and benefits, but
Congress denied them those privileges in the Rescission Act of
1946, the same year the Philippines gained independence from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Filipino groups have been fighting for equity ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the cost of providing full veterans benefits to
Filipinos was estimated at $5 billion. The cost goes down each year
as the old soldiers die.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the money is not the issue here,'' Melegrito said. ``It's
the issue of being recognized. They want nothing else but to have
their honor and dignity restored. For the last 53 years, they have
not been paying these veterans, so you can argue the U.S.
government has been saving money.''
</P>
<P>
   Lourdes Tancinco, a San Francisco lawyer and president of the
board of the newly opened Veterans Equity Center in the city, said
the SSI benefit had nothing to do with equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SSI bill is financial assistance to needy U.S. citizens,''
she said. ``It's not at all an answer to what they've been
clamoring for. The fight for equity still continues.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest that Filipino veterans have come to equity is a 1990
law allowing them to become American citizens. About 24,000 of them
_ including 7,000 in the Philippines _ have been naturalized.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,000 veterans living in the United States, plus the 7,000
in the Philippines, are eligible for SSI. Lachica believes 2,000 of
the 7,000 U.S. residents will, like Fajardo, want to return to the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Fajardo's face lights up when talking about his hero's funeral.
But when asked about the equity bill for Filipino veterans, his
smile turns into a frown and furrows creep into his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not interested anymore in the equity bill,'' he said.
``It's too hard. I believe they won't sign the equity bill. It
involves too much money.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes him no less adamant about the injustice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought side by side with the American soldiers,'' he said.
``We should also have the same benefit as Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 85, though, he is giving up his fight for equity. He will
probably not miss the tiny apartment he shares with his wife and
grown son. He sleeps in the walk-in closet, which he says is warmer
than the rest of the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   He is already thinking about how he will pass his days when he
goes back to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will attend to my family,'' he said. ``Maybe I can still
direct my orchestra. I have many pieces I have collected _ tango,
rumba, waltz.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At some point this year, I noticed that I could not bend over
and touch my fingertips to the ground. The combination of running
the marathon, completing a century (riding 100 miles on a bicycle)
and the subsequent nursing of sore knees, tight quads and stiff
hips had taken its toll: What little flexibility I was born with
had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's New Year's resolution to cut back on running and
spend more time stretching went the way of most New Year's
resolutions (ignored until forgotten), and the thought of
struggling through an organized stretch class filled with
limber-bodied budding ballerinas was too intimidating to consider.
</P>
<P>
   So I did what any cardio-addicted athlete would do who needs to
sweat to feel she has worked out: I signed up for the hottest
exercise class in town. Hottest literally, because Bikram yoga
(less formally known as hot yoga) is conducted in a room heated to
100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   During the 90-minute class at the Yoga College of India, where I
practiced 26 Hatha yoga poses, including the tree, the mountain and
the triangle, I still managed to be the least limber in class. But
who cares when you are touching your nose to your knees (and wiping
off the sweat pouring down your face) for the first time in your
life?
</P>
<P>
   Hot yoga, a strenuous version of the suddenly trendy
5,000-year-old discipline based on breathing and stretching
techniques, was developed in the early 1970s by Bikram Choudhury as
a way to heal the body after injury or illness. (Choudhury had been
an Olympic weight lifter until he suffered a career-ending injury.)
</P>
<P>
   The yoga poses he chose were designed to enhance strength,
flexibility and balance, a combination, he said in an interview
from Beverly Hills, Calif., that is ``essential in reducing the
negative aspects of stress, illness, injury and aging on the
body.''
</P>
<P>
   The first studio, Bikram's Yoga College of India, opened in
Beverly Hills in 1973, and celebrities like Madonna, Michael
Jackson and Robert Downey Jr. have all come to sweat. Today, gyms
around the country are turning up the heat and turning themselves
into hot yoga studios faster than they can say om.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 50 Bikram yoga ``colleges'' in the United
States, and some 500 Bikram-certified instructors. In the New York
City area, several hot yoga studios have opened in the last year
</P>
<P>
   What sets this style of yoga apart from others is, of course,
the heat. Warmed-up muscles make the body more pliable, enabling a
deeper stretch. ``The heat speeds the blood supply into muscles,
tendons and ligaments,'' explained Toni Goodrich, owner of the
five-year-old Greenwich Yoga Center in Connecticut and a former
student of Choudhury in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This is no class for wimps. Even without the heat, Bikram yoga
is challenging. Holding 26 different body positions for 10 to 60
seconds at a time involves strength, stamina and intense
concentration. ``The first class you take, you're going to feel
like throwing up,'' said a fellow student, Christina Magliocco von
Oist. ``But soon, you get used to the heat, and the yoga gets
easier the more you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was right on both counts. The first time I took hot yoga, I
did feel ill _ not from the class, which had not even started, but
from the smell that hit me when I stepped out of the elevator into
the fourth-floor reception area. Think of a locker room that has
never been cleaned or a musty summer house that has never been
aired. Then put the locker room inside the summer house.
</P>
<P>
   Odor aside, the class, taught by a co-owner, Donna Rubin, was
just what I had hoped: not so difficult that I got discouraged but
hard enough that the athlete in me felt challenged until the very
last minute, when we lay on our backs and rested. (The fee for the
first session was $15; the second class is free, and subsequent
classes are $17 each.)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 90 minutes, Ms. Rubin carefully instructed us,
demonstrating each move. If we could not perfect the initial pose,
for example, if our standing leg was not perfectly straight for the
``standing head to knee'' pose, she would not let us move on to a
more advanced position.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a modified version, should a beginner have
difficulty,'' she explained after the class. ``It's important to go
at your own pace. As your body improves, the posture will improve.
Go to where you feel the stretch, but don't push beyond your
capability, and don't compare yourself to anyone around you. That
way, you'll never get injured.''
</P>
<P>
   The poses she led me through were simple, a sort of yoga for
dummies. In the ``awkward,'' or chair, pose, for instance, I
squatted as if sitting in a chair and held that position for 20
seconds. Then I took a brief break before practicing it one more
time.
</P>
<P>
   As the 90 minutes progressed, I grew more and more fatigued,
probably from the Calcutta conditions: You start sweating profusely
the minute you walk into the enclosed room with its three whirring
wall heaters. I wanted to yank open one of the windows facing the
street.
</P>
<P>
   I became irritable after one particularly long-held pose in
which my sweat-drenched foot kept sliding off my sweat-drenched
thigh. A washcloth, handed out at the beginning of class to grasp
slippery body parts, was drenched and useless in minutes, and the
beet-red color of several classmates' faces was alarming. But Ms.
Rubin kept encouraging me throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise,'' she said, ``the first time is the hardest. The
next time you come, you won't even notice the heat.'' She also
reminded us to drink water between poses and to leave the room if
we felt too hot. By the end of the class I felt as if I had run a
half-marathon in mid-August. That night I slept like a rock, every
inch of me stretched, strengthened and thoroughly fatigued.
</P>
<P>
   Can exercising in man-made heat be dangerous? ``Probably not,''
said Dr. Melvin Williams, an exercise physiologist at Old Dominion
University and the author of ``Lifetime Fitness and Wellness''
(William C. Brown, 1992). ``When muscles get warm, they're more
pliable and can be stretched more easily, which is why you stretch
better after a run than before. In heat, there's probably less
chance of an injury.''
</P>
<P>
   And Marika Molnar, a physical therapist with the New York City
Ballet, said: ``You could make the argument that all yoga and
stretching should be conducted in heated rooms. When you're
stretching muscles to any extreme range of motion, it would be nice
if the heat of your body and the heat of the room were similar. The
heat allows the muscles and the connective tissues to relax and
resist the tension of the cold. Dancers always tell me how much
more range of motion they have in the summer, because studios
aren't air-conditioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Could I get hurt if the heat is artificially creating
flexibility where there isn't any? ``You can't fabricate
flexibility,'' said Ms. Goodrich. ``Each person has a range of
motion that they begin with and that they can attain. The heat just
aids the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bikram yoga is not about being a noodle,'' she emphasized.
``It's about being strong.''
</P>
<P>
   And, after a hot yoga class, very sweaty, too.

   With her tense little-girl voice and big round eyes popping with
heated questions, Winona Ryder has always radiated the high-strung
energy of a brainy young woman who, despite her good looks, doesn't
appear entirely comfortable inside her own skin. Watching her on
the screen, you sometimes have the uneasy feeling that the wrong
remark could trigger a tantrum that would send furniture flying in
all directions.

   In ``Girl, Interrupted,'' Ms. Ryder (who served as an executive
producer) digs hungrily into the role of a neurotic young woman
who, in today's therapeutic parlance, ``acts out'' with a
vengeance. In conveying her character's volatile emotional life Ms.
Ryder gives her most penetrating screen performance, one that
deserves extra credit for not pleading for our love.
</P>
<P>
   During much of the film, adapted from Susanna Kaysen's
best-selling memoir of her nearly two-year stay at McLean
psychiatric hospital in Belmont, Mass., in the late 1960s, Ms.
Ryder's character, is, to put it plainly, a shrill, whiny pain in
the neck. Or as the hospital's unflappably down-to-earth ward
nurse, Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg), puts it when Susanna throws one
of her tantrums: ``You are a lazy, self-indulgent little girl who
is driving herself crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   What lands Susanna in the hospital (renamed Claymoore for the
movie) is an impulsive, half-serious suicide attempt in which she
tries to cure a headache by chasing down 50 aspirin with a bottle
of vodka. The year is 1967, and the counterculture is blooming.
Instead of going to an Ivy League college like many of her friends,
Susanna has no future plans other than the vague intention of
becoming a writer. When she checks herself into Claymoore (unaware
that she can't voluntarily check herself out) she appears to be the
sanest resident in the young women's ward. It isn't long before she
is itching to be discharged.
</P>
<P>
   Until the movie runs amok with a contrived, melodramatic climax
in the basement of the institution, ``Girl, Interrupted,'' directed
by James Mangold (from a screenplay by Mangold, Lisa Loomer and
Anna Hamilton Phelan), succeeds in avoiding the more grotesque
snake-pit cliches of films set in mental hospitals. While it
doesn't begin to match ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' in
metaphorical resonance and emotional clout, ``Girl, Interrupted''
presents a meticulous, true-to-life portrait of a time (the late
1960s) and place (the hothouse world of upper-middle-class Boston
suburbia), where the era's combustible social stresses drove
sensitive young women like Susanna into states of flailing
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Susanna is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, that
catch-all psychiatric term for emotionally disturbed people whose
symptoms elude neat categories. The movie reminds us how much more
paternalistic and morally judgmental the psychiatric profession was
in those days. Because she has had a fling with the husband of a
friend of her parents, has sex with her boyfriend when he visits
her in the hospital, and allows a male attendant to kiss her,
Susanna is deemed ``promiscuous,'' a label she vehemently rejects.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other young women in Susanna's ward are clearly
worse off than she. The two deeply troubled patients to whom the
movie devotes the most time are Daisy (Brittany Murphy), a young
woman obsessed with laxatives and roast chicken who has probably
been sexually abused by her father, and Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a
charismatic sociopath who becomes Susanna's best friend and partner
in mischief. Daisy, with her father's support, cajoles her way out
of Claymoore long before she is ready to be discharged. Lisa, a
longtime inmate, is continually escaping and being hauled back and
isolated in a straitjacket.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jolie's ferocious, white-hot performance captures the scary
allure of this daredevil and brutal truth teller, the movie's
answer to R.P. McMurphy of ``Cuckoo's Nest.'' ``Girl, Interrupted''
tentatively pits Lisa against the hospital staff as contestants
vying for Susanna's soul but loses its nerve in the final scenes by
making sure we know that Lisa is really a hopeless nut case.
</P>
<P>
   The film's emotional grounding wires are the no-nonsense Valerie
(Ms. Goldberg at her calm, understated best), who patiently endures
Susanna's racist insults, and Claymoore's chief psychiatrist, Dr.
Wick (Vanessa Redgrave), who is wisdom and compassion incarnate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' is a small, intense period piece with a
tough-love attitude toward lazy, self-indulgent little girls
flirting with madness: You can drive yourself crazy, or you can get
over it. The choice is yours.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Girl, Interrupted'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and sexual
situations.

BRIGHTEST OF MOONS AND TALLEST OF TALES

<P>
   High tides, not cosmic levels of illumination, may be the most
noticeable effect Wednesday night when an unusual combination of
celestial events produces one of the largest and brightest full
Moons in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The Moon will have an extra glow, astronomers say, because it
will be as close to Earth as it has been all year _ about 222,000
miles away compared with an average of 239,000 miles _ and thus
will appear larger in the sky. In addition, Earth, and therefore
the Moon, is nearing it closest approach to the Sun (which will
occur on Jan. 3, 2000), increasing slightly the lunar illumination
and adding to its brightness.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this full Moon will coincide with the winter
solstice, which happens only once every 133 years, has raised wide
interest, particularly on the Internet, where messages over the
last few weeks have suggested that Wednesday's full Moon will be so
brilliant that people driving at night in snowy areas may not need
their headlights. It is a fine story, but, like many Internet
legends, it has been embellished a bit along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Moon will be a little larger and brighter than
usual, the increased brightness will be evident only to observers
with instruments, said Professor Brad Schaefer of the Yale physics
department. ``And its occurrence on the winter solstice is of
little astronomical importance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while millions may be looking up and marveling at what they
think is an incredibly bright Moon, the real importance of the
event may be the extreme high tides caused by the nearby full Moon.
Serious flooding is possible if there are coastal storms. Extreme
tides, both high and low, occur about twice a year when the Moon is
full or new (invisible) and is at its perigee, or close point, in
its monthly orbit around Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hoopla over Wednesday's full Moon, the real lunar
show comes at the next full Moon on Jan. 20, 2000, when North
America will witness a full lunar eclipse.

COOKIES FOR THE HOLIDAYS
</HEADLINE>
 4 takes  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Includes sidebar, HOLIDAY-COOKIES-GUIDE) 
 
 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many, it just wouldn't be the holidays without Christmas
cookies. While cookies are baked throughout the year, they have a
special place in holiday traditions for lots of families.
</P>
<P>
   They come in a myriad of flavors, colors and shapes _ and fancy,
simple or complex. There's something creative and festive about
presenting them on a cookie tray for friends or guests, wrapping
them up as a special gift or leaving a plate for Santa.
</P>
<P>
   Some are perennial favorites made yearly while others are
treasures that catch our eye in newspapers, magazines or cookbooks
_ and become cherished additions. If you're looking for some good
last-minute ideas, a trio of new cookbooks _ ``Alice Medrich's
Cookies and Brownies'' (Warner Books; $23.95), ``Cookies for
Christmas'' by Jennifer Dorland Darling (Meredith Press; $24.95),
and ``The Magnolia Bakery Cookbook'' by Jennifer Appel and Allysa
Torey (Simon &AMP; Schuster; $25) _ offers plenty of good, fast-fix
options for time-stressed holiday cooks. If you choose recipes
carefully, you can whip out several batches in no time flat.
</P>
<P>
   Medrich, the former owner of the now-defunct Cocolat in Berkeley
for 14 years and who is known as the truffle lady, realized when
she started to write about cookies that they had not been updated.
</P>
<P>
   At a holiday cookie exchange she hosted for 30 foodies a few
years back, she found the offerings were either over or underbaked,
bland, and lacked character and flavor. It was not what she
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contemporary tastes and standards for food have changed,'' she
notes. Although Medrich was not a cookie expert when she started to
write the book, she wanted better cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply not enough for a cookie to be sweet and rich _ we
want superb texture and lots of flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   The premise of her new book was to boost flavors and communicate
what makes the difference between tough and tender, crisp and limp,
buttery vs. greasy. It's the details that count and can mean
success or failure resulting in fabulous cookies or miniature
doorstops, she says. ``Anyone can make cookies. Cookies are part of
the baking repetoire and are much fussier and detail-oriented than
creations in the general cooking repertoire. I am willing to fuss
with fancy desserts or cakes, but I want cookies really simple. I
am more interested in flavor and texture than shapes _ and I like
bar cookies,'' she says, noting that the Lemon Bars are among her
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, Medrich came up with 50 recipes that are, for the
most part, easy to make and delicious. ``This is a small personal
collection (that she makes and serves again and again) rather than
an encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   For Darling, author of ``Christmas Cookies,'' holiday cookies
are about capturing and sharing the joy of the season and family
tradition. The book is filled with 130 recipes, color photographs
and chapters featuring Old World favorites, convenience products,
drop cookies, ornaments and a Victorian gingerbread house.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Magnolia Bakery Cookbook,'' Appel and Torey,
proprietors of the Magnolia Bakery in New York's Greenwich Village,
share some of their favorite cookies, along with other popular
baked items. Beyond the usual chocolate chip and peanut butter
cookies and brownies, you'll find recipes for Iced Molasses
Cookies, Peanut Butter Cup Cookies, White Chocolate Coconut
Macadamia Cookies, Butterscotch Cream Cheese Swirl Brownies and
Strawberry Oat Bars.
</P>
<P>
   Although the seasonal time crunch may take its toll on your
yearly cookie efforts, opt for preparing the easiest, yet most
sophisticated-looking cookies in a variety of textures and flavors.
Forget complicated cookies that require lots of fussing _ and rely
on bar or drop cookies with a minimum number of ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that bar cookies are a boon to the hurried cook as
lots can be turned out in short order with minimal effort _ and
they are virtually fail-proof.
</P>
<P>
   To yield a variety of different looking cookies, custom-cut them
into various size squares, strips, rectangles, triangles or
diamonds, depending on how you plan to serve and use them.
</P>
<P>
   In recipes calling for nuts and jams, it's feasible to vary the
choices _ and sometimes even combine flavors in a single pan,
making half of it with one flavor and the other half with another.
</P>
<P>
   Also, consider setting aside a chunk of time and doing your
holiday baking assembly-line style in a couple of sessions. Once
you put one recipe together and get a batch in the oven, start
preparing the next.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late to turn your kitchen into a holiday
cookie-baking factory. Add some of the winning creations that
follow to your own treasured holiday traditions. You're in for some
delicious eating. &QL;

   RASPBERRY CRUMB BARS
</P>
<P>
   Based on a classic shortbread recipe, this tender buttery cookie
balances perfectly with its filling of sweet-tart raspberry
preserves. The generous crumb topping is made with a portion of the
dough mixed with oats and nuts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut up,
plus extra for preparing pan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sifted powdered sugar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups unsifted all-purpose flour &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled OR quick-cooking oats (not
instant) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped walnuts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup seedless raspberry preserves
</P>
<P>
   Butter a 9x9x1 1/2-inch baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, using a sturdy spoon or an electric
mixer, beat together butter and powdered sugar until completely
smooth and well blended. Sift in flour and salt and blend all
together just until dough forms crumbs or large clumps. Turn dough
out onto a piece of wax paper. With lightly floured hands, squeeze
dough into a rough ball. Warmth of your hands softens butter and
brings dough together.
</P>
<P>
   Divide dough ball into thirds. Crumble one portion into a bowl
and press remaining portions in an even layer on bottom of prepared
pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake on center rack in preheated 375-degree oven 15 to 18
minutes, or until golden brown around edges and pale gold on top.
Remove pan to a heat-proof surface and cool.
</P>
<P>
   Add oats and nuts to dough in bowl and pinch all together to
form crumbs. Spread preserves over baked dough in pan, then top
evenly with crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Return pan to oven and bake an additional 20 to 24 minutes, or
until crumbs are golden brown on top. Cool pan on a wire rack, then
divide each side into quarters and cut into 16 bars (2 1/4x2 1/4
inches). When bars are cold, use a spatula to lift onto a rack or
plate, or serve directly from pan. Bars are extremely fragile while
warm. Makes 16 (2 1/4-inch) squares.

<TEXT>
<P>
   These cut-out cookies are sturdy enough to use as ornaments on
the Christmas tree. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup light (mild) molasses &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground allspice &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cloves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking soda &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) butter OR margarine, cut up &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, beaten &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ornamental Frosting (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   In a 3-quart saucepan, heat sugar, molasses, ginger, allspice,
cinnamon and cloves to boiling, over medium heat, stirring
occasionally with a wooden spoon. Remove pan from heat; stir in
baking soda (mixture will foam up in pan). Stir in butter until
melted. Stir in egg; add flour and stir until dough forms.
</P>
<P>
   On floured surface, knead dough until combined. Divide dough in
half; wrap 1 half in wax paper and refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   With a floured rolling pin, roll remaining dough half a scant
1/4-inch thick. With floured 3- to 4-inch assorted cookie cutters,
cut as many cookies as possible; reserve trimmings. Place cookies,
1 inch apart on an ungreased large cookie sheet. If desired, with a
skewer, make 1/4-inch hole near edge of each cookie for hanging as
an ornament.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 325-degree oven 12 minutes or until edges
begin to brown. With a wide spatula, transfer cookies to wire racks
to cool. Repeat with remaining cookie dough and trimmings.
</P>
<P>
   When cookies are cool, prepare Ornamental Frosting. Use frosting
to decorate cookies; let dry completely, about 1 hour, before
serving. Makes about 3 dozen cookies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ORNAMENTAL FROSTING
</P>
<P>
   This hard-drying icing, tinted with food coloring, is used to
decorate cookies. Use meringue powder in order to avoid raw egg
whites in this uncooked frosting. Meringue powder is available
wherever cake- decorating equipment is sold. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 package (16 ounces) powdered sugar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons meringue powder &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup warm water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Assorted food colorings (optional)
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, with mixer at medium speed, beat powdered sugar,
meringue powder and water until blended and mixture is so stiff
that a knife drawn through it leaves a clean-cut path, about 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If desired, tint frosting with assorted food colorings; keep
covered with plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Use a small metal
spatula, artists' paint brushes or decorating bag with small
writing tips to decorate with frosting. (You may need to thin
frosting with a little warm water to obtain right spreading or
piping consistency.) Makes about 3 cups.

MAKING THE PERFECT COOKIE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This is a sidebar to HOLIDAY-COOKIES, but it can also stand
alone) 
 
 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to cookie-baking, it's the details and simplest
things that make the difference, says Alice Medrich, author of
``Cookies and Brownies.'' ``Baking is not as forgiving as general
cooking, even when it comes to something as simple as a cookie.''
Here are tips she and other cookie expert shared for the best
results.
</P>
<P>
   _ For cookie success, measure ingredients carefully and use the
proper measures (dry measures such as metal or plastic cups ranging
from 1/4 to 1 cup for dry ingredients and plastic or glass measures
with a pouring spout or lines up the sides for liquid ingredients).
Heap and sweep the flour as follows. Scoop the flour (use bleached
all-purpose) into a measure without sifting or tapping until it is
heaped above the rim. Do not shake or pack into cup. Level with a
straight-edged knife or spatula by sweeping across the cup. Measure
liquid ingredients into a cup placed on a counter, not up in the
air, and lower your head to read the measurement at eye level.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use proper mixing and handling techniques to yield tender
cookies. Overmixing and too much flour will cause tough cookies.
For most recipes, minimal mixing is the key. Medrich tested the
recipes in her book using a bowl and spoon as well as with an
electric hand-held mixer. Once the flour is added to the dough, mix
only enough to get it well distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much and how long the ingredients are mixed has a
surprisingly significant affect on the taste and texture of the
cookie,'' says Medrich. Although 90 percent of the cookie recipes
you see tell cooks to beat the butter and sugar until light and
fluffy, Medrich disagrees. For some recipes the butter and sugar
should be beaten until light and fluffy, she says, while for others
it should be beaten just until creamy. Medrich's recipes advise
cooks when to stop beating. Butter cookies are best when the butter
is just softened and beaten by hand or with an electric mixer with
the sugar just until smooth and creamy. For sugar cookies, Medrich
beats the twosome until light and fluffy.
</P>
<P>
   The consistency of the butter also affects the texture and
flavor, she continues. She found melted butter simply mixed with
the sugar made the best shortbread, chocolate chip and oatmeal
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medrich favors parchment paper for any heavy chocolate batters
or meringues. Some cookies _ including chocolate chip, oatmeal and
butter cookies _ tasted better and had delicious caramelized crisp
edges when baked directly on the cookie sheet rather than on the
parchment. For convenience, foil also can be used to line cookie
sheets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shiny metal pans are preferred for baking cookies as dark pans
absorb heat and cookies may become too browned, tough and hard.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be sure to preheat the oven _ which usually takes about 15 to
20 minutes _ prior to baking cookies. Check the oven temperature
with an oven thermometer _ and have it calibrated if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   _ For even baking, make all cookies in the same batch the same
size, shape and thickness. Use a scoop with a squeeze-release
handle (many sizes are available at restaurant supply and cooking
stores) for ease in forming equal-size portions of dough.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use baking times in recipes as guidelines. Check cookies at
the minimum time the recipe indicates. Use a timer to avoid
guessing. Watch cookies carefully while baking as a minute or two
can make a difference in the end results.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always cool cookie sheets before placing a new batch of raw
cookies on them to avoid having dough melt. Otherwise you may end
up with misshapen cookies, too much spreading or altered baking
times. ``If you have already formed cookies on parchment or foil
liners, you can slide the liner onto a hot or warm cookie sheet as
long as you place it in the oven immediately,'' advises Medrich.
</P>
<P>
   _ If baking a single pan of cookies, bake in the center of the
oven. If baking two sheets at once, position sheets in upper and
lower thirds of oven and reverse, from upper to lower and front to
back, halfway through the baking time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cool cookies thoroughly before storing or stacking in a closed
container.
</P>
<P>
   _ Any chocolate will do in cookie recipes _ says Medrich, who
tested her recipes with affordable grocery store chocolate _ until
you start to compare. ``Better chocolate makes better cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Medrich compared baking cookie doughs just after making, after
chilling four hours and after chilling overnight. The dough chilled
overnight yielded the cookies with the best texture, flavor and
appearance when it came to chocolate chip, butter and oatmeal
cookies. Medrich speculates that it's probably because the flavors
marry and the flour has a chance to become thoroughly moistened.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medrich avoids freezing baked cookies. She prefers cookies
baked fresh. In a pinch, freeze the dough up to a month before
baking.

<P>
   Terry Hoddinot, 36, of London, Ontario, has been blind since the
age of 3. His son, Riley, 3{, lost his left eye a month ago. The
same rare eye cancer, retinoblastoma, was diagnosed in his baby
daughter, Katie, while she was still in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say there is a good chance that they may have saved
Katie's vision with a bold new procedure: delivering her
prematurely, then treating the affected eye before the cancer had a
chance to grow and blind her.
</P>
<P>
   The approach, described by Dr. Brenda L. Gallie, a University of
Toronto ophthalmologist, at the annual meeting of the American
Society of Human Genetics in San Francisco in October, has
important implications for the treatment of retinoblastoma, a
potentially fatal genetic disorder that afflicts 1 in 20,000 North
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gallie's treatment has not been accepted everywhere, but
retinoblastoma researchers say it holds promise for the 10 percent
of victims who, like Katie Hoddinot, have a family history of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us can point to a case or two where three weeks would
have made a difference,'' said Dr. Timothy Murray of the University
of Miami's Bascom Palmer Eye Institute. ``The size and the extent
of the tumor clearly is associated with whether we can preserve the
eye without losing vision. Everyone will tell you that the earlier
you deliver the child, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   When Patti Hoddinot was nearly eight months pregnant with Katie,
the doctors discovered by amniocentesis that the fetus had the same
genetic defect as her father. It meant that she was likely to
develop eye tumors, and that they might even start growing before
she was born.
</P>
<P>
   So Dr. Ants Toi, a radiologist who is a colleague of Gallie,
began checking Katie's eyes every week with ultrasound scans.
Gallie's hope, she said, was that if the scans found tumors, Katie
could be delivered three weeks early to jump-start anticancer
therapy and save as much sight as possible. Since the fetus tends
to move around, getting just the right view of its eyes requires
the patience of a baby photographer, Gallie said.
</P>
<P>
   No tumors were seen on the scans. But because of the family
history, labor was induced early, with the consent of Mrs. Hoddinot
and her obstetrician. Sure enough, when Katie was born on March 17,
there was a tumor in her left eye near the edge of the center of
vision. Katie became the second child to be delivered prematurely
for early retinoblastoma treatment. (The first, MacKenzie
Brinker-Winch, also a patient of Gallie, was born a month before
Katie, and a tumor was substantially reduced.) Before the tumor
could grow larger, it was burned away with a green laser beam.
</P>
<P>
   For Katie and other children who have a family history and whose
condition can be detected late in pregnancy, Gallie thinks the loss
of three weeks of maturity is a good trade-off for the likelihood
of improved vision, particularly if ultrasound shows that the tumor
may be impinging on the field of central vision. She has been
talking for years about inducing delivery to get early help to
these children. Now Gallie, a professor of ophthalmology and
molecular and medical genetics at Toronto's Princess Margaret
Hospital, has done it.
</P>
<P>
   While other retinoblastoma researchers praised her approach,
none have copied it so far. For some, the reason is that no baby
has come along who fits the needed criteria. ``I've never had a
child with retinoblastoma tumors I couldn't treat at birth after a
normal delivery,'' said Dr. Joan O'Brien of the University of
California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But others say retinoblastoma is too complex for the treatment
to do much good. Dr. David H. Abramson, director of ophthalmic
oncology at the Weill Cornell Center of New York Presbyterian
Hospital, says ultrasound scans are not sensitive enough to detect
many tumors; if the tumor is in the center of the eye, and big
enough to be seen on ultrasound, it will destroy vision anyway, he
says. If the tumor is big and on the periphery, it can be treated
by laser after a normal birth.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he says, treating the tumors that may develop in
the last three weeks of pregnancy are irrelevant to those that may
continue to develop unpredictably all the way through the age of 7;
some children may develop as many as two dozen, and the mean number
is five.
</P>
<P>
   ``We explored induced delivery with our group,'' he said, ``and
we don't think it's going to accomplish what Dr. Gallie wants to
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Abramson says a more promising approach may be to give
chemotherapy to the mother in the last few weeks of pregnancy and
let the anticancer drugs pass from mother to fetus. Chemotherapy is
often given toward the end of pregnancy to mothers with cancer,
with no apparent harm to the child, but it has not been tried for a
fetus with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. A. Linn Murphree of the University of Southern California
School of Medicine's Doheny Eye Institute points out that the
genetic disorder in itself does not cause the tumors. What is
inherited, or develops spontaneously, is a single working copy of
the retinoblastoma gene on chromosome 13 in every cell, instead of
two copies, as is normal.
</P>
<P>
   With only one copy of this tumor suppressor gene, an accident in
cell division can lead to no copy _ and tumor growth. But that does
not guarantee that tumors will develop.
</P>
<P>
   Murphree described identical twins he treated who were born
about three weeks prematurely. One child had a large tumor in the
area of central vision, which had to be destroyed by laser. The
child will still have peripheral vision in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   The other twin had no tumor in either eye and has developed none
by the age of 4 months. ``That's chance alone,'' Murphree said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gallie says her first two patients retained considerably
more sight than they would have had they gone full term.
</P>
<P>
   Prenatal ultrasound at 34 weeks determined that MacKenzie
Brinker-Winch, her first patient, whose mother, Corinne Brinker,
was the carrier, had a large tumor in the middle of her left eye.
It doubled in size in a week when labor was induced. The tumor
responded well to chemotherapy. From that tumor, MacKenzie should
wind up with 20/400 sight in that eye. Her right eye had a small
peripheral tumor at birth that was treated with a laser, and
doctors hope her vision in that eye will be unimpaired.
</P>
<P>
   But early this month, she developed a new tumor near the optic
nerve of her good eye, her mother said, and stereotactic radiation
will be tried to destroy it. The prognosis is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Hoddinot, however, is still looking good, with normal
vision for her age in both eyes, even though eight small tumors
have developed and been treated by laser since birth. Her mother
says that if the doctors had waited for a full-term delivery, ``it
would have been a whole different story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled,'' Mrs. Hoddinot added. ``We think we're a huge
success story.''

(Hollywood's former desert playground is on the rebound)  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
PALM SPRINGS _ She was quite a knockout in her prime. Fresh.
Frisky. Possessing a beauty that smoldered _ often literally.
Famous entertainers frequently made the trek from Hollywood to
spend time with her, to bask in her sun and her glory.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In time, however, younger, brighter rivals began to emerge, and
the rejection that followed was not a pretty sight.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, Palm Springs, Hollywood's desert playground in the
'30s, '40s and '50s, was helplessly observing an exodus, as
travelers drifted deeper into the Coachella Valley _ bound for
lavish, glistening, !ital!new!off! resorts in the communities that
sprouted to harbor them: Rancho Mirage, Palm Desert, Indian Wells,
La Quinta.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Palm Springs was in imminent peril of becoming a
pathetic dowager in cracked pink stucco, sifting through the
black-and-white photos of a long-gone era _ look, here's Jayne
Mansfield in repose with a Chihuahua perched on her back.
</P>
<P>
   But Palm Springs fooled them all. It tidied up, moved the dining
tables outdoors and introduced a relatively foreign concept _ foot
traffic _ to Southern California. It invited the film community for
a festival and established a weekly street market. It launched a
kick line in which no hoofer under age 50 would be permitted. (Take
THAT, spa bunny.)
</P>
<P>
   The town played, without a hint of apology, to its colorful
history. Then, funny thing, nostalgia and kitsch suddenly became
cool. And everyone came streaming back.
</P>
<P>
   It's a thoroughly delightful place once again _ all the more so
at this time of year, when it offers a dry, sun-washed antidote to
the damp chill that constitutes winter in Los Angeles. And yet it
hasn't lost its quirkiness.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning walk along Palm Canyon Drive, Sinatra music
was heard streaming from the open door of a sidewalk establishment.
Not Frank. Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   Casually dressed desert bums jockeyed for position at open-air
cafes with the clad-in-black, cell-phone crowd.
</P>
<P>
   One eccentric soul happened by, leading a dog by a thick leather
leash; the bug-eyed pooch was no bigger than a rat.
</P>
<P>
   The entire scene was punctuated by a veritable car show of
Detroit excess. You thought all the gas-guzzling sedans were phased
out during the '70s oil crunch? Not quite. They're still being
manufactured and sent directly to Palm Springs, where they line up
hood ornament to tail fin, windows up and air conditioners
blasting. Really big cars _ Cadillac Broughams, Lincoln Town Cars,
Chrysler New Yorkers _ driven by a curmudgeonly set that thinks
Japanese compacts are tinker toys and SUVs ride like bread trucks.
</P>
<P>
   These are the signs of a community's prosperity, its rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've held our own,'' said Sally McManus, who grew up in Palm
Springs and now is director and curator of the Palm Springs
Historical Society. ``We had a little period where we weren't doing
that well, but we're going strong now.''
</P>
<P>
   The revitalization began in the late 1980s, when the late Sonny
Bono was mayor of Palm Springs. ``Downtown was in need of rehab,''
said Brian McGowan, a city economic development specialist. ``The
decision was made to make it into an arts and entertainment
district.''
</P>
<P>
   The process was numbingly slow, for a variety of reasons. In
order to promote foot traffic in the downtown area, ordinances had
to be overthrown. One prohibited sidewalk lighting _ a remnant from
the '50s that sought to enhance star-gazing. Another barred outdoor
dining; McGowan isn't sure how that one got on the books. The
recovery was also conducted at a snail's crawl because of the
early-'90s recession, which tended to linger longer in communities
whose economies were tourism-based.
</P>
<P>
   But dogged strides were taken to make the region more appealing.
Lights went up. Tables went outdoors. Proprietors were encouraged
to install French doors, swing them wide and share the music with
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Now Palm Canyon Drive teems with activity day and night,
particularly in the area of Tahquitz Canyon Way. In fact, the
Starbucks on that corner is said to be the second-highest-grossing
franchise in the Seattle-based coffee chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' says McManus, ``because nobody used to stroll.
Certainly not at night.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an inviting place, and it feels like a downtown district _
something those resort communities down valley can't offer.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great spot for people watching and window shopping, or
for long, leisurely moments on one of those restaurant patios. On a
Sunday afternoon a few weeks back, a band was doing a pretty fair
impersonation of Los Lobos at Las Casuelas Terraza.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is difficult to beat, with the San Jacinto Mountains
providing a backdrop to the cleaned-up Mission Revival architecture
of the town. The best time for savoring the mountains' beauty is in
the morning, when the rising sun fires them in brilliant shades of
purple and pink.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Canyon Drive scene is further punctuated by thick
strands of mature bougainvillea vines _ they cascade over walls and
eaves, spreading their red blossoms everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   For a random chuckle, don't miss Palm Springs' ``Walk of
Stars.'' Cheeta the chimp, from the Tarzan movies, has a star here,
right next to Chevy Chase, in fact. And it wasn't enough to honor
Elvis Presley; his manager, Col. Tom Parker, has a star, too.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Springs' comeback is also reflected in a recent explosion
of organized events.
</P>
<P>
   _An international film festival was established nine years ago.
This year's event is scheduled for Jan. 13-24 at the Palm Springs
Festival of Arts complex. Box office: (760) 322-2930.
</P>
<P>
   _VillageFest, a Thursday night street fair, has been going
strong for eight years, offering visitors a feast of music, food
and vendors' wares (Palm Canyon Drive between Amado and Baristo
roads).
</P>
<P>
   _The Fabulous Follies, a chorus line of veteran hoofers
(currently ranging in age from 55 to 85) that has shown no signs of
flagging _ either in popularity or in energy _ since its first kick
at the Plaza Theatre in 1990. The group's handbills read: ``They're
sexy, they're beautiful, they're talented ... they're old.''
Reservations: (760) 327-0225.
</P>
<P>
   Next summer, a major renovation project will begin at the Desert
Fashion Plaza. ``They're literally going to take the roof off the
thing and make it into an outdoor walking-shopping area,'' McGowan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Springs' rejuvenation is evident in a sprouting of boutique
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   One in particular, Korakia Pensione, has drawn fawning praise
from publications as disparate as Los Angeles magazine and the
London Sunday Times. But a visit to Korakia in mid-November
produced a decidedly uneven experience.
</P>
<P>
   Lying a few blocks west of Palm Canyon Drive, the inn is
actually two properties, a 1920s Moroccan villa on one side of
Patencio Road, a Mediterranean villa on the other. Together,
they're composed of 20 rooms which range from $120 to $260 nightly.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity materials for the inn take pains to list the
celebrities who have stayed there, among them Laura Dern, Andy
Garcia, Chris O'Donnell, Alicia Silverstone and New York Times
publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. Perhaps because Korakia has proven
so popular with Hollywood and received such favorable press, it
operates under policies that wouldn't fly at most lodgings.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't accept credit cards, for example, accepting payment
only in cash, check or traveler's checks. It also requires a
two-night reservations deposit in advance. Payment for the balance
of your stay is required upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
   If you find your accommodations unacceptable after one night of
a planned two-night stay _ as we did _ there is no refund for the
second night. What was even more curious, when we checked out a day
early, the desk clerk didn't seem the least bit interested in
inquiring as to whether the stay had been enjoyable _ or why it was
being cut abruptly short.
</P>
<P>
   Guest enjoyment at Korakia probably has a direct correlation
with the room assigned. Particularly on the Mediterranean side of
the street, rooms are tucked away in quiet, poolside settings. (Two
free-standing bungalows looked particularly inviting.)
</P>
<P>
   Our room was the Library, which shares an extremely thin wall
with the lobby, on the Morrocan side. Music _ best described as New
Age desert nomad funk _ throbbed through that wall until 11 p.m.
(ceasing only because we searched out the stereo in the
otherwise-deserted lobby and turned down the volume ourselves). The
music resumed in the morning promptly at 8.
</P>
<P>
   The tromping of the occupant overhead, in the Upper Studio
Balcony room, was intrusive, too _ particularly since it started at
5 a.m. and persisted for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The room was said to contain a ``handmade four-poster bed,'' but
comfort was very much an issue _ the feather-bed mattress mounded
dramatically in the center, playing havoc with neck vertebrae in
the night.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe these annoyances would have been mitigated if we'd been
able to enjoy a cheery blaze in the fireplace. The desk clerk who
checked us in noticed the empty rack and said, ``I'll have some
logs sent over.'' ``Yes, we'd like to have a fire,'' my wife
responded. But the clerk seemed more concerned with answering the
ringing cell phone on her belt, and the wood never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Korakia is located on a street crowded with apartment buildings
and private residences. This can have its drawbacks. Continental
breakfast on the front patio was serenaded by nearby leaf blowers.
And though the pool on the Moroccan side of the street is
luxuriantly warm, its view of the San Jacintos is marred by power
poles, transformers and the neighbor's roof.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pity Korakia was found to have such bothersome flaws,
because owner Douglas Smith has decorated it thoughtfully and
tastefully, and _ aside from the indifferent service _ has created
a warm, enchanting environment reminiscent of a desert hideaway. At
night, the place is ablaze with candles, and both pools are
bordered by open fires _ a rock fireplace on the Moroccan side of
the street, deck torches on the Mediterranean side.
</P>
<P>
   After being bid a curt (and costly) farewell at Korakia, we
moved on to another hotel with roots deep in Palm Springs' past.
The Estrella Inn, which was popular with the Hollywood crowd in the
'30s and '40s, takes great pains to preserve that legacy.
</P>
<P>
   It is done in rough, salmon-colored stucco, with flowering vines
and several shady, mature citrus trees (beware the overhanging
grapefruits when you're sitting in the whirlpool).
</P>
<P>
   As with Korakia, it's helpful to know in advance which rooms to
request. The property includes three motel-like rectangles built in
the '70s, and the rooms therein are unexceptional _ though ours was
clean, spacious and mercifully quiet. (In winter, standard rates
range upward from $125.)
</P>
<P>
   Much more intriguing are the Estrella's 14 villas _ which were
undoubtedly called cottages when they were built in the early '30s.
They are free-standing units, many of them engulfed in
bougainvillea, and feature tile floors, arched hallways and shower
stalls, kitchens, dining rooms, living rooms, private patios.
Walking through the front door is like stepping into a Raymond
Chandler novel.
</P>
<P>
   They're named after various stars of the era _ Jean Harlow,
Ginger Rogers, etc. _ and it's not purely gimmick. Estrella staffer
Charles Ziino says that the inn's previous owner, stumbling upon a
box of guest records in the hotel's basement, was intrigued to
discover that some movie stars were known to specify a particular
cottage on each visit. The rooms were christened _ and decorated
with photos _ accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   A one-bedroom villa rents for $200 (including breakfast), a
two-bedroom for $300, although those rates will rise to $250 and
$360 after the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever possible, dinner in Palm Springs should be taken out-
of-doors, and there are numerous such options along Palm Canyon
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   For perhaps the best fine-dining option in the area, however,
head to Le Vallauris, a few blocks west of the main drag at 385 W.
Tahquitz Canyon Way. Tables are set up on a tree-shrouded patio,
romantically lit, and the French-California selections are
delectable. Recently, they included a rich and savory Maine lobster
ravioli with basil bisque sauce ($14 as appetizer, $24 as main
course); a salad of baby spinach, endive, pear, walnuts and
Roquefort cheese ($9.50); filet mignon with black trumpet mushrooms
($30); and a roasted, stuffed pork loin with dried cranberries (the
tart cranberries were delightfully complemented by thin-sliced
parslied potatoes).
</P>
<P>
   Two other restaurants, LG's Prime Steakhouse and the Kaiser
Grille, have also attracted attention, in part because of their
participation in a kind of reverse exodus. In the '80s, according
to McGowan, Palm Springs' finer dining establishments were fleeing
to the resort enclaves down valley.
</P>
<P>
   LG's and the Kaiser Grille, however, are highly regarded Palm
Desert restaurants that branched out into Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The owners decided that something special was happening there:
</P>
<P>
   A dowager was in recovery. And looking sharp once more.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>

   A revitalized Palm Springs is gentle on the eye. A bronze
sculpture, ``Agua Caliente Women,'' presides over the corner of
Tahquitz Canyon Way and Indian Canyon Drive, and the San Jacinto
Mountains provide an impressive backdrop for the community's
Mission Revival architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Springs had to overturn an ordinance prohibiting sidewalk
dining in order to coax visitors back to its downtown district. Now
Palm Canyon Drive is liberally peppered with such establishments.
</P>
<P>
   Korakia Pensione is a small Palm Springs inn that has the look
and feel of a desert hideaway. It has its quirks, though, and may
not be for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Foot traffic was practically unheard of on Palm Canyon Drive
until the community lifted a longstanding ban on bright street
lighting.

   TAKE-BOS  
 LOS ANGELES: ... a chance.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Was it any wonder, then, that his coming-out party turned into
such a free-for-all?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think he reluctantly put in for the draft,'' says
DeGregorio. ``He didn't do it until three or four hours before the
deadline. I think he thought he was doing the right thing for him
and his family. Two or three days later, he was expressing regrets
to his teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   But by then, he had no recourse, and all he succeeded in doing
was mystifying the evaluators who had him pegged as the top overall
pick in the draft. He attended a tryout in Vancouver, then stopped
auditioning, rejecting an offer to work out for the Bulls, who
owned the No. 1 choice, and skipping the predraft camp in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the week of the draft did he showcase himself for a
handful of NBA representatives. Among them was Clippers scout Jim
Mitchell, who arrived a couple of hours before the trial run,
talked at length with Odom, and was impressed with what he heard.
But the Clippers, renowned for making unimaginable draft blunders,
had been on Odom's trail all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had him checked out thoroughly, just like we do with all
our top picks, and he knows that,'' says Baylor. ``A couple of
people whom he thought were close to him said some negative things,
and they proved to be absolutely untrue. I had an opportunity to
talk to him a long time on the phone. He said he was confused,
fighting with himself about whether to try to get back into
college. I was satisfied with what he had to say. He was very
honest. He said he'd done some things he regretted when he was 17 _
nothing illegal or anything like that _ just some mistakes he'd
made.''
</P>
<P>
   For once, the Clippers didn't regret their selection. Picking
fourth, behind the Bulls (Duke's Elton Brand), Grizzlies
(Maryland's Steve Francis), and Hornets (UCLA's Baron Davis), they
hit the jackpot _ as did Odom, who received a three-year, $7.8
million contract that is considered only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally with a rookie, you say, `Oh, he's all right,' '' says
Clippers veteran guard Eric Piatkowski. ``With Lamar, after the
first week of camp, I said, `This kid is going to be something
special.' I'd seen him play (in college) and seen a couple of the
others, and I thought, `This guy is definitely going to be No. 1.'
There was no question in my mind. I couldn't believe it when he
fell to fourth. Man, what were these guys (picking ahead of the
Clippers) thinking? This is the type of thing that could cost a
couple of guys their jobs, these so-called gurus.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Growing up fast &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it's evident that the only reason Odom's name
wasn't called first was his reluctance, which in turn created
doubts among those so-called gurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're making a decision with so much riding on it,''
says Odom, ``there's going to be some indecision. I just wanted
everything to be right. I found I couldn't go back, so I was going
to be a pro. When you're 19 years old, you want the right
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no division of opinion that Odom is in the ideal
situation on the court, which Baylor considers ``like therapy'' for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a flower opening up,'' says Harrick. ``When he steps
across that black line, you can't wipe the smile off his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the faces of those who watch him. Odom's sublime talents
never have been in question. ``He's as special a player as I've
seen join the NBA in quite a while,'' says Walton.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Odom, who left his teens behind only last month,
is that rarest of commodities _ a big man who can put the ball on
the floor, who can create his own shots off the dribble, who is
equally at home on the perimeter or under the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``His versatility is outstanding,'' says Clippers and former
Celtics coach Chris Ford. ``You can't define him as a positional
player. You just leave him on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   When the referees allow it. Nominally the starting small
forward, Odom has played every position except center with the
Clippers, for whom he debuted with a 30-point, 12-rebound effort at
Seattle, but lately has hit a rookie wall of sorts, thanks in no
small part to the fouls that seem automatically assigned to him.
</P>
<P>
   His attitude toward his successes and struggles is instructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about that Seattle game is we lost,'' says Odom,
``so what good did Lamar Odom do? I can't find my rhythm at all
lately. I've been playing horribly. I'm not blaming anybody but
Lamar Odom. This is the most games I've ever played in my life so
fast. It's a matter of getting used to the schedule. I've got to
get in the gym, keep working, be a warrior, be a good teammate.
That's what basketball is all about to me _ being a good
teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal thinks Odom is trying to be too good a teammate. ``He
seems to be trying to be a playmaker more than doing what he has to
do,'' says the Laker luminary. ``It's a learning process he has to
go through. But I know he's a good player. On any given night, he
can take over a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern to his admirers is getting acclimated to the
pro lifestyle, fending off the sharks. Abdur-Rahim can speak from
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's loaded,'' says the Grizzlies small forward. ``I love his
game. He can do just about everything well. But there's an
adjustment. The way I look at it, most guys who go to college (for
four years) are really just getting into their jobs when they're 24
or 25. We're ahead of our time. We've got a lot of people depending
on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why Odom seeks sanctuary with DeGregorio, a man
who never has asked anything of him, only for him. They became
friends during a summer league when Odom broke his nose and
DeGregorio _ who wasn't even his coach _ drove him to the hospital.
The bond became unbreakable when DeGregorio gave Odom a safe haven
to get his diploma. Even now, Odom calls DeGregorio twice a week,
if for no other reason than to say, ``This is your son, your only
son. I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He could've played at this level two years ago,'' says
DeGregorio. ``I think what he misses about college basketball is
the life, the sense of family. You practice, you study film, you go
to class, you eat as a team. In the NBA, it's two hours of practice
and the rest of the day is yours. Certainly if you're a single kid
alone for 22 hours a day, there's a lot of influences, none of them
good.''
</P>
<P>
   As if anticipating such pitfalls, Odom, who lives with Liza and
Destiny, places a premium on ``being a professional, learning how
to handle yourself off the court, being responsible with your
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his difficulty in making some decisions, that may seem
ironic. But DeGregorio believes ``he's done a remarkable job''
adjusting to enforced independence, and those around Odom daily
concur.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't find too many kids his age who are that mature,''
says Clippers assistant coach Jim Todd.
</P>
<P>
   To which Baylor amends, ``You don't find too many guys around
for 10 years who are that mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom really had no choice.

   NUKE-SUIT (Washington) _ Former nuclear weapons scientist Wen Ho
Lee on Monday sued the FBI and the Justice and Energy departments,
alleging they violated his privacy and wrongly portrayed him as a
Chinese spy. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, accuses the
agencies of violating the Privacy Act and selectively leaking
``misleading information designed to convince the public that Lee
had engaged in espionage activities for the People's Republic of
China.'' The suit, which was brought by Lee and his wife Sylvia,
does not specify monetary damages. But it opens a second front of
legal attack for the jailed scientist, who was charged earlier this

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time turns the ordinary extraordinary _ even the $43.64 grocery
receipt Beth Evans-Ramos slips into a protective plastic sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   She pairs this oh-so-'99 cultural relic with advertising fliers
and a picture of the Safeway at her local minimall in Mill Creek,
Wash.
</P>
<P>
   It's all going to a place she's not. The far, far future.
</P>
<P>
   It's a future where a $2.25 gallon of milk, a $6.99 takeout
pizza or pre-HomeGrocer.com stores with four concrete walls may be
a thing of marvel. ``This tells people in the future, `Here is how
we got our food. We used to go to a store in a strip mall,''' says
Evans-Ramos, a local expert in making memory boxes and time
capsules.
</P>
<P>
   Time capsules in various forms are almost as old as
civilization, from the coffins of Egyptian mummies to the
torpedo-shaped time capsule Westinghouse Electric Co. sealed at the
New York World's Fair in 1939, not to be opened for 5,000 years.
The idea of making time stand still, of putting it in a bottle, has
endless appeal, especially in the waning days of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Store shelves and Internet sites are full of commercial capsules
of varying quality. ``Bury one for the millennium,'' boasts an ad
from 4TimeCapsules.com for a $99 capsule with industrial-grade
plastic pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Ads show a truck running over it.
</P>
<P>
   Time trippers can spend from $5 for a plastic capsule shaped
like a giant pill, at Packaging Specialties in Seattle, to $500 and
up for heavy-duty aluminum and stainless steel varieties. A myriad
of flimsy cookie-tin capsules are on the market, filled with reams
of paper to fill out: family trees and pop culture synopses and
letters to future generations.
</P>
<P>
   They don't impress Evans-Ramos. She believes in do-it-yourself
simplicity. ``People are sick of the commercialization of the
millennium,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Evans-Ramos makes a face as she weeds through the papers in two
commercial time-capsule packages: one is meant for kids (``I don't
see a child wanting to do all this writing''), one for adults.
(``Who has the time for another big project this time of year?'').
</P>
<P>
   She recommends keeping capsules simple, using objects to tell
stories and making up the rules as you go along. ``It's one of
those brand-new traditions,'' Evans-Ramos says. ``There's no right
or wrong way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A sturdy box kept in a dark closet and opened every decade is as
effective as a $400 aluminum capsule buried in the back yard for
great-great-great-great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Evans-Ramos has made capsules using a house-paint can, a
stationery box, even an old film reel container, bought secondhand
and decorated with stick-on letters and tags: ``Do not open until
1-1-2010 '' and ``Review contents, add more and seal up until next
decade.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like too much work, grab a shoebox, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone should do one _ even if you just take the box on Jan.
1, walk around the house, pick up newspapers and magazines and jam
them in. How hard is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``And there'll be somebody in future who will really appreciate
it _ even if it's a perfect stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Meyers Gibbs, one of Evans-Ramos' time-capsule students,
used an Army ammunition box for a high-school millennium capsule,
to be opened at the 50th-year reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs is now busy making a boxed family version for the
millennium, with hardware fliers and computer fliers (``That's
going to change in a big way''), grocery receipts, grandma's
crochet, family writings and mementos, and pictures of the changing
view from her living-room window. ``I may put in my brother's
lists, too. He makes lists of how many televisions and phones
people have. He even went through his closet and counted all his
shirts and shoes,'' says Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's kind of interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs has no intention of burying the past. At least not these
pieces of it. ``I'm afraid I would lose it _ or if we move out, I
might forget it's there,'' she says. ``I also want it to be
something you can grab if the house is burning down.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're set on burial, Evans-Ramos recommends using a simple
canning jar. Inside her quart jar, she put a photo of her suburban
Mill Creek chateau, a Garfield Pez dispenser, Yankee Diner matches,
costume jewelry and other pop culture artifacts, adding a little
packet of silica gel from a box of tennis shoes to cut down on
moisture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably bury it a foot down in the back yard. You want
someone to be able to find it,'' she says. ``Can you imagine what a
hoot that would be?''
</P>
<P>
   Evans-Ramos confesses to a Martha Stewart streak, evident in
capsule creations dolled up in bows and collages. Atop one
vintage-looking box is a picture frame with a family collage of
charms, coins, jewelry, a feather (``for tickling _ our family
likes humor'') and the Evans-Ramos surname spelled out in Scrabble
letters, scavenged at a garage sale. Two old belts are buckled
around the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make it so it's not easy to peek,'' says
Evans-Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   Her boxes and capsules are filled with pieces of everyday life:
tickets stubs for Mariners' games and $7 movies, recipes for Mom's
Meat Loaf and Aunt Iris' Jell-O Cool Whip Salad, catalogs for
cookware and fashions. ``That's so your great-great-grandkids can
make fun of what you wore,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   There are In Style magazines and TV Guides. ``People may think,
`What a silly simplistic way to spend your time.'''
</P>
<P>
   And there are dumb videos (``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''),
and a Super Mario 3 video-game instruction booklet purloined from
her two boys. ``That's so they can tell their kids, `See, we used
to spend months of our lives doing this.'''
</P>
<P>
   She has high hopes for the Nine Inch Nails CD she slipped into
the mix: ``I'm just hoping the grandkids go, `Oh Dad! What were you
listening to?'''
</P>
<P>
   Evans-Ramos laughs. ``Of course, there may not be anything to
play these on.''

<P>
   _ Paper (especially newsprint) may have high-acid content.
Separate pieces in acid-free plastic or glassine sleeves; look for
an ``archival safe'' notation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use acid-free glues and gluesticks. You may want to line your
box with acid-free tissue paper, and wrap each item in it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remember that videotape may last only 10 years, while
traditional black-and-white photographs may last a century or more.
Color photos are suspectible to color change and fading.
</P>
<P>
   _ Think twice about burial. It is estimated that more than 90
percent of capsules in history have been lost or suffered damage
after being buried.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't put precious wedding pictures, birth certificates and
other prized documents in a capsule. Those go in a safe-deposit
box. Instead, photocopy them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Select a date when the capsule is to be opened, something with
personal or familial significance: the solstice, the new year, a
birthday or anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't put capsules in an insulated attic (too hot) or a
basement (too damp). Light can also cause damage. A dark closet is
best.
</P>
<P>
   _ Label and date everything. Mark the backs of photographs with
soft-lead pencil. Use full names of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't laminate and don't use self-adhesive tape. It sticks for
only five to 10 years, and leaves messy adhesive behind.

   PREVENTION: For Diabetics, a Sight-Saving Eye Test
</P>
<P>
   With relatively basic eye examination, vision loss among people
with diabetes can often be prevented.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the nation's 16 million diabetics develop at least
some retinopathy, which damages the small blood vessels in the
retina. But what frustrates experts in the field is that it cannot
be discerned through a regular eye exam; to see it, the examiner
must dilate the retina with drops. Retinopathy can be treated with
laser surgery, if detected early.
</P>
<P>
   Avoidable vision loss is particularly prevalent among diabetics
who are black, studies have shown; black diabetics suffer twice the
rate of blindness as white ones.
</P>
<P>
   But a new study finds that examination rates among blacks can be
greatly improved with an aggressive education program. About 90
percent of the patients who took part in the study ended up having
dilated-eye exams, which are crucial in avoiding vision loss, said
the report, published in the current issue of The American Journal
of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The study, sponsored by the National Eye Institute, part of the
government's National Institutes of Health, focused on black
diabetics, 280 in all, because the disease occurs more often among
the black population and has a disproportionately severe effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really important issue,'' said Dr. Charles E. Basch,
chairman of the department of health and behavioral studies at
Teachers College, Columbia University, who helped direct the study.
``This is an area where there's effective treatment, and it's an
area where people are just not getting diagnosed in a timely way.''
</P>
<P>
   BEHAVIOR: Antismoking Campaigns Elude Gay Men
</P>
<P>
   Gay men are almost twice as likely to smoke cigarettes as men
over all, a new study finds.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by researchers at the University of California at San
Francisco, looked at 2,600 men who described themselves as gay or
bisexual. About 48 percent reported smoking, compared with about 27
percent of all American men.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said they were not sure how to account for the
disparity. They looked at a variety of factors, including heavy
drinking, frequenting gay bars and being personally affected by
AIDS, and found that this seemed to explain some of the higher
incidence of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, they said, the study suggests a need for
antismoking programs that are more effective with gays.
</P>
<P>
   The lead author, Dr. Ron Stall, pointed out that the smoking
rate was highest among younger gay men _ 50 percent for those 18 to
24. That, he said, suggests a health danger that could last for
years.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in The American Journal of Public Health,
found that although higher educational level was associated with a
lower incidence of smoking, gay men at all educational levels
smoked more than the general male population. Among older gay men,
the smoking rate was lowest.
</P>
<P>
   NOSTRUMS: Recipe for Health: Shaken, Not Stirred
</P>
<P>
   The return of the martini, which with the cigar has become one
of the more dubious symbols of the go-go '90s, has found some
unusual defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian researchers report that after studying a variety of
alcoholic beverages, they found that the martini scored highest for
its antioxidant properties, which researchers believe may help the
body fight everything from cancer to cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   But simply stirring the gin and vermouth, the researchers say,
will not do. They must be shaken, in the manner of a certain
British secret agent.
</P>
<P>
   The study appears in The British Medical Journal's Christmas
issue, which traditionally devotes space to offbeat topics. (Other
articles in the same issue include one study of people who agreed
to have sex in MRI machines, and another of the most common first
names of women seeking treatment for venereal diseases.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the motivation behind the research was serious, said Dr.
John Trevithick, a professor at the University of Western Ontario.
Alcohol has long been shown to have antioxidant properties, and
Trevithick and his colleagues were testing a variety of beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Why martinis scored so high was unclear, although researchers
believe that much of the antioxidant power comes from the plants
from which they are produced and even the wood casks in which the
beverages are stored.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the study, Trevithick said, his daughter,
Colleen, who helped with the research before entering UCLA,
suggested comparing stirred martinis with shaken ones. ``We thought
probably the shaken would be just as good,'' he said. To the
researchers' surprise, the difference was significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really not able to explain this,'' Trevithick said.
</P>
<P>
   STAGES: When Specialists Err on Aging Voices
</P>
<P>
   Some elderly people who are given diagnoses of voice or speech
disorders may simply be showing ordinary signs of aging, scientists
say.
</P>
<P>
   A study of 44 men and women aged 70 to 80 detected numerous
changes in their speaking voices.
</P>
<P>
   But the study noted that speech pathologists trying to determine
whether a patient had a voice disorder often relied on tests based
on the voice patterns of young and middle-aged people.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, specialists can wrongly conclude that there is a
problem and prescribe speech therapy, said the report, which was
presented last month to the annual conference of the American
Speech-Language-Hearing Association in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances are that it is just a part of the aging process,''
said Dr. Steve Xue, an assistant professor of hearing and speech
sciences Ohio University, who wrote the report.
</P>
<P>
   Xue and his colleagues found that among the elderly people they
studied, voices commonly changed. Men's voices, for example,
sometimes became higher, and women's, lower. Study participants
also found that their voices had become harsher or more hoarse, or
that it was harder to keep a stable tone.

   LINKS: An Online Aid for Surviving Cancer
</P>
<P>
   More people than ever are surviving cancer, health officials
say; by one estimate, about 8.4 million Americans who have had
cancer are alive today. But from this indisputable good news flows
a host of new challenges for doctors and patients alike, as the
survivors and their families face years of uncertainty and health
concerns that few people without cancer could imagine.
</P>
<P>
   A newly redesigned Web site aims to make these waters easier to
navigate.
</P>
<P>
   The site is an overhaul of one that has been maintained for some
years by the National Cancer Institute's Office of Cancer
Survivorship. It is designed to be of use not just to patients but
to researchers and practicing doctors. Its address is
http://dccps.nci.nih.gov; follow the link to ``Survivorship
Research.''
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the information there is not new, officials
say, it has been reorganized for simplicity. Different forms of
cancer, for example, are given their own sections. And visitors
seeking information about new treatments can read about 1,800
clinical trials. There are also numerous links to other information
sources.
</P>
<P>
   In its old version, the site drew about 5 million visits a
month, officials said.

   The Better to See With
</P>
<P>
   Giant squid, those monsters of the deep, are famous for (among
other things) having eyes the size of dinner plates.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes word that another sea creature had eyes that could
just as easily have graced a table. A researcher at the University
of California Museum of Paleontology and colleagues report that
some types of ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles that lived 90 million
to 250 million years ago, had eyes up to 10 inches in diameter,
rivaling those of the largest giant squid. The ichthyosaur eyes are
the largest ever found in a vertebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Ichthyosaurs, which ranged in size from about 7 feet to more
than 30, had fishlike bodies, including fins and vertical tails.
Among the fossils studied, those of a genus called Ophthalmosaurus
had the largest eyes for its size, about 9 inches in diameter for a
body length of roughly 13 feet.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the larger the eye, the better it can see in low
light conditions. The researchers, writing in the journal Nature,
estimate that the ophthalmosaurs could probably have detected point
light sources (like those from photoluminescent prey) in deep
water, and suggest that the creatures dived to depths of close to
2,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the idea that ophthalmosaurs were deep divers, the
researchers found evidence in the fossil bones that the reptiles
suffered from the bends, which occurs when an animal (or human)
dives to great depths and rises too quickly, with the pressure
changes causing gas bubbles to expand in tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Atomic Clock Watch
</P>
<P>
   Strange things happen during a solar eclipse. Twilight falls,
the wind can shift, birds stop singing: it almost seems that time
stands still.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than almost. Experiments during some eclipses over
the last half century have appeared to show strange things
happening to atomic clocks and pendulums, attributed to some
unexplained feature of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   A set of experiments during four partial eclipses from 1987 to
1992 was particularly odd: it showed a small but significant
accumulated time difference between atomic clocks in the same
laboratory, where the gravitational effects, if any, would have
been the same.
</P>
<P>
   But a new study by German scientists during August's total solar
eclipse in Europe contradicts these previous findings. The
experiment used four atomic clocks of three different types, and
all were placed in an air-conditioned basement laboratory in
Wessling, Germany, with a computer recording their time differences
every four seconds between Aug. 3 and 23 (the eclipse occurred on
the 11th). The results showed no anomalous changes in the relative
rates of the four clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Haze Over China
</P>
<P>
   Burning of soft coal to feed its growing economy has made China
the world leader in sulfur emissions, and its neighbors are
complaining about acid rain caused by all that sulfur. But China's
economic progress is causing problems at home in the fields as
well.
</P>
<P>
   A NASA-financed study by a professor at the Georgia Institute of
Technology and colleagues shows that heavy haze in China's chief
growing regions may be cutting agricultural production by up to
one-third.
</P>
<P>
   The aerosol haze, which the researchers say is most likely a
result of the burning of coal and other fuels, acts like a filter,
absorbing some of the sunlight that would ordinarily be used by
plants for photosynthesis.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who reported on their work in a recent issue of
The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said that
sunlight was reduced by 5 percent to 30 percent over the roughly
250,000 square miles of hazy areas in China, which include some of
the country's most productive farmland.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists also point out that similar haze problems exist
in many developing countries.

BARBIE AND OTHER TOYS TO GO ON AN OIL-FREE DIET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., the Netherlands, Canada)   By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbie is about to become environmentally correct. Her creator,
Mattel Inc., the world's largest toy maker, announced this month
that it would begin an effort to eliminate petroleum-based
plastics, which have been linked to an assortment of environmental
and health problems, from its most popular doll and many of its
other toys.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental and consumer groups say the announcement marks a
significant break with industry practice. ``It is a major move, and
other manufacturers are going to have to follow,'' said Rick Hind,
legislative director of the environmental group Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel's decision to use plant- and vegetable-based plastics
instead of polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, only partly quieted an angry
controversy surrounding a host of plastic toys. Greenpeace is one
of about a dozen public advocacy groups that have campaigned
against vinyl plastics _ not only because so much is manufactured
that is not degradable and poses an eventual threat to the earth's
ecosystems, but also because of potential health risks.
</P>
<P>
   Some ingredients in polyvinyl chloride, including lead, cadmium
and phthalates, can leach out of the plastic under certain
conditions and present serious health risks, the advocacy groups
contend.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mattel said that its toys were safe but that it
was acting because ``concerns do exist and have been expressed by
environmental groups as well as retailers and others, and we want
to address those concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry's trade group, the Toy Manufacturers of America,
echoes the view that the toys with polyvinyl chloride are safe for
children or all ages, but it has taken no position on the Mattel
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The company's announcement came directly after it was asked by
reporters about the results of new tests by the National
Environmental Trust, a Washington-based environmental group, on the
content of plastic toys made by Mattel and 16 other manufacturers.
These products, specifically bathtub or squeeze toys, are designed
for children under 3 who often put them in their mouths and suck on
them. The consumer groups say the toys, which contain phthalates,
chemicals that have been found to cause liver, kidney and
reproductive problems in animals, may present an immediate danger.
</P>
<P>
   The Mattel announcement also came just before the 15 countries
of the European Community, as expected, imposed a ban on the
teethers and rattles, and also required safety labeling on other
plastic toys that are not designed for the mouth but that often end
up there.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission asked
manufacturers to remove phthalates voluntarily from both kinds of
products.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Wise, policy director of the National Environmental Trust,
says its testing shows that American manufacturers have complied
with the commission's request in one area _ teethers and rattles _
but not in the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is welcome news that Mattel will make a big effort to find
alternatives to phthalates and PVC-based plastics,'' Wise said in
an interview. But he added, ``The company and the entire toy
industry are dragging their feet on these mouth toys, which are an
immediate problem while millions of children are being exposed to
these chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Environmental Trust's tests of 17 kinds of the
bathtub and squeeze toys found one form of phthalate, DINP, or
diisononnyl phthalate, in all of them. A Mattel toy, Pooh Bathtub
Pal, was among those with high concentrations, as were the
Teletubbies, a product of Ritvik Toys of Montreal. The analysts
also found one toy, Pony Luv, made by the Tara Toy Corp. of
Hauppauge, N.Y., that had a 24.4 percent content of another form of
phthalates, DEHP. American toy manufacturers who had widely used
this DEHP, a suspected carcinogen, agreed voluntarily to ban it
from its products in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Molyneux, a senior vice president at Mattel, said the
company did remove phthalates from teethers and rattles but not
from Pooh Bathtub Pal because ``it was not designed for the
mouth.'' This was the also the view of Ritvik. Tara declined to
comment. The toy industry says the Consumer Product Safety
Commission has asked for the removal of phthalates only from
teethers and rattles. The commission insists that it has asked for
action in both categories.
</P>
<P>
   The commission sought the voluntary action on DINP on the ground
that significant uncertainty existed about its safety. Tests have
shown that it causes kidney and liver damage in animals. But the
commission did not order a ban, saying the amount of the substance
that children ingest appeared to be far below levels that would be
harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Critics dispute that, saying the decision was based on one small
Dutch study showing that children suck on squeeze and bathtub toys
just 12 minutes a day. On Friday, a National Institutes of Health
advisory panel said the study was of ``only 19 children'' and was
preliminary at best.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is exposure: how much time plastic toys are in babies'
mouths. Dr. Harvey Karp, a pediatrician in Santa Monica, Calif.,
said the Dutch research did not reflect reality. ``Children come
into my office with plastic dolls and toys they have literally
chewed through,'' he said. ``Parents just don't understand that
when this happens, toxic materials can leach into their children's
mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission said its
researchers were conducting broader studies, expected to be
completed in the spring.

ODOM HAS FINALLY FOUND HOME IN NBA 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is about 15 minutes before tapoff to a
pre-holiday NBA drudgefest, the 4-16 Vancouver Grizzlies visiting
the 4-16 Clippers, and Lamar Odom is joining his Los Angeles
teammates in some final preparatory stretching. Supine on the
Staples Center court, he raises his left leg to its skyscraper
height as a trainer stands on tiptoe to apply pressure to his foot.
Suddenly, Odom shrieks _ not in unbearable pain but in euphoric
recognition. There, by the stanchion to the Clipper basket, he has
just spotted his past innocence.
</P>
<P>
   University of Rhode Island coach Jerry DeGregorio, whose team
has a game at the University of San Francisco the following night,
has made the hour flight, unannounced, to pay a surprise visit to
his 20-year-old protege, who considers him ``like a father to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom bounds to his feet, and with a couple of giant strides, he
leaps into DeGregorio's arms, a 6-foot-10-inch, 220-pound wraith
taking gleeful refuge in the embrace of the much smaller man. They
exchange greetings, Odom plants a quick kiss on DeGregorio's cheek,
and then it's back to business.
</P>
<P>
   DeGregorio does not see a vintage performance by the former Ram.
Odom endures the rookie's crucible of excessive scrutiny by the
referees, drawing foul calls for everything short of blinking, and
he is disqualified late in the game for the first time in his
infant pro career.
</P>
<P>
   But there are highlights. At halftime, DeGregorio applauds as
Odom receives the NBA Co-Rookie of the Month plaque for November,
emblematic of the impact already made by the man-child of promise
in this land. And in the fourth quarter, briefly unshackled, Odom
comes off the bench to offer a glimpse of his preternatural skills
_ fighting inside for a lefthanded bank shot, canning a jumper off
the glass from the right, drilling a cross-court laser pass that
Tyrone Nesby converts into a 3-pointer
</P>
<P>
   _ as the Clippers snap a nine-game losing streak, 102-90.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, it gets even better. Odom spends a precious hour with
his mentor. He presents him with the NBA hardware. ``He gives me
all his trophies,'' says DeGregorio.
</P>
<P>
   And the youngster, who has searched nearly a lifetime for a
father, shows his surrogate that that quest will skip at least a
generation. With the child's mother, Liza Morales, looking on, Odom
cradles his 16-month-old daughter, Destiny, an incandescent smile
creasing his serene features. ``I'll always be there for her,'' he
says. ``When it comes to family, I get serious.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a tableau that is all too brief, the closest Lamar Odom
will get to a college reunion. For one sweet respite, he is able to
satisfy both sides of his ambivalence. &QL; 
 &QL; 
School daze &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that easy. If only Odom could simultaneously
bestride the Kingston, R.I., campus where he spent two essentially
blissful years and the NBA arenas that have been considered his
inevitable destination since he was an adolescent.
</P>
<P>
   That is impossible, of course, but it didn't ease the conflict
for Odom last spring when first he declared he would leave school
early to become eligible for the draft, then changed his mind, only
to discover that according to NCAA rules, there was no turning back
because he already had retained an agent.
</P>
<P>
   So here he is, the key ingredient in the misbegotten Clippers'
rise to respectability. They are only 6-17after beating visiting
Golden State, 92-91, Friday _ a game Odom won when he banked in an
8-foot runner with 11.9 seconds to play. Odom has played in all 23
games, averaging a team-high 38.7 minutes. He is second on the team
in scoring (16.6 points a game) and assists (3.7), third in
rebounding (7.1) and blocks (1.2).
</P>
<P>
   More than that, he is being hailed as a cosmic prodigy by
virtually everyone who sees him: by his teammates and Clippers vice
president of basketball operations Elgin Baylor, the Hall of Fame
forward; by Clippers television analyst Bill Walton, the Hall of
Fame center and former Celtic; by the Grizzlies' Shareef
Abdur-Rahim, an established All-Star who also left college after
playing just one year; and by the King of LA himself, Lakers center
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a grand entrance. And yet there is this other world .
. .
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss URI every day,'' Odom says softly. ``Every day when I
wake up, I think about it. But it's human. It's like when you get
divorced _ you don't stop thinking about the divorcee. The way I
look at it, it was a win-all situation. Either I'd still be on a
college campus _ another year of college wouldn't have hurt _ or
I'd be playing basketball at the best level and being well-paid for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality isn't as neat as the summation. His hesitant pro
arrival was merely the latest complication Odom has endured since
his parents separated when he was 6, his father left his life, his
mother died when he was 12, and he was raised in New York by his
grandmother, Mildred Mercer. Ever since he was a national schoolboy
prodigy who, because of academic difficulties, attended three high
schools _ in New York City, Troy, N.Y., and finally Milford, Conn.
Ever since he was accepted by the University of Nevada-Las Vegas,
only to be released from his grant-in-aid when Sports Illustrated
raised questions about the validity of his entrance exam scores.
Ever since he called DeGregorio, with whom he had shared a room for
six months while pursuing his high school diploma at St. Thomas
Aquinas in Milford and who had just been hired as new URI head
coach Jim Harrick's assistant, and said, ``Coach, I've got nowhere
to go.'' Ever since Harrick, who had recruited Odom before being
fired as UCLA's coach, and DeGregorio pleaded his case with the
school administration, which admirably disregarded the charges that
it was turning URI into a fleshpot athletic clearinghouse and
admitted him as a nonmatriculating student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were tough times,'' recalls Odom, who resisted
six-figure pro offers from Europe and the CBA in order to gain
college eligibility. ``I couldn't practice or travel with the team.
I just studied and worked out on my own. It was the first time I
hadn't been part of a team.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was only natural that even when he became part of the URI
team the following year, even as he was becoming the Atlantic 10
Rookie of the Year and leading the Rams into the NCAA tournament,
where they lost in the first round of the Midwest Regional at
Milwaukee, he would be tugged at like a wad of taffy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the NCAA game, I saw guys in that lobby I'd never seen in
my life,'' says Harrick, now the coach at the University of Georgia
after doing an impression of Odom in miniature, first taking the
job, then deciding to stay at URI, then opting to leave after all.
``It was disgusting. Lamar came up to me and said, `Coach, I've got
cousins here I've never seen before.' He never had a chance to stay
in school. People didn't give him a chance.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ninety million years ago, on what is now an empty lot in
Sayreville, N.J., a flower-filled tropical forest stood in flames,
its many blossoms burning and smoldering away not into ashy
oblivion, but into paleontological perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   For, as scientists now know, the fires that periodically swept
these woods so long ago preserved its blooms as perfect charcoal
fossils, creating the most bountiful and exquisitely preserved
cache of ancient flowers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists at Cornell University have already uncovered more
than 200 species of fossil flowers at the site, including ancient
relatives of carnations, cactuses, teas, azaleas, water lilies,
oaks, pitcher plants and magnolias. These charcoal flowers,
preserved in breathtaking three-dimensional detail right down to
the level of the individual cell, are revealing not only how
ancient relatives of modern plants looked but also, in some cases,
how they lived at this time when the dinosaurs still roamed New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the findings are turning botanical lore on its
head, by revealing that the great diversification of flowering
plants, which are the most species-rich and important group of
plants on earth, took place at least 90 million years ago, some 30
million years earlier than previously suspected.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the findings suggest that insects were diversifying
right along with the plants, providing support for the theory that
an interaction between these two groups, which together account for
most of the species on earth, may have driven their mutual and
explosive diversification.
</P>
<P>
   The site ``is a very special place,'' said Dr. David Dilcher,
paleobotanist at the University of Florida, who was not involved in
the work. ``This is a time when flowering plants were beginning to
diversify, caught right in the act. We never realized that until
this group started producing the results that they're getting from
this locality.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Chase, molecular biologist at Royal Botanic Gardens at
Kew in England, who uses the fossil flowers to date the origins of
living plants that he studies, said, ``Based on what they're doing
we're getting some major changes in our thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But to paleontologists the discovery provides much more than new
dates.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William L. Crepet, a paleobiologist at Cornell University,
said that finding even one complete fossil flower was ``the
equivalent of finding a new dinosaur intact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly amazing thing,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Crepet said there were likely to be billions of charcoal fossil
flowers at the site, representing a diversity of species comparable
to a modern tropical rain forest. Flowers, unlike leaves or pollen,
are gold mines of information often containing all the crucial
features needed to identify plants.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most paleontologists did not even believe
flowers were likely to be preserved as fossils. In fact, so
unlikely did these finds once seem that paleontologists worked for
years on other more standard fossils, impressions left in rocks, at
the New Jersey site, without noticing the charcoal flowers that
were there.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another good reason earlier researchers missed the
flowers: They are tiny, often one-sixteenth of an inch across or
less. A tenth to a fiftieth the size of their modern relatives,
these nubs must be studied by electron microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought they were just fragments, not very well
preserved,'' said Dr. Kevin Nixon who is on the Cornell team with
his wife, Dr. Alejandra Gandolfo, and Crepet. ``No one really
realized what was in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for their minuscule size remains something of a
mystery. Researchers guess that the reduction in size is due, at
least in part, to the process of burning, something Crepet calls
``the shrunken-head phenomenon,'' referring to the way living
tissue shrinks when it dries. But researchers note that ancient
flowers may also have been much smaller than their modern
counterparts to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the most stunning finding is the diversity of species,
there are particular blossoms whose stories have surprised
biologists.
</P>
<P>
   Paleoclusia, for example, is a plant whose modern relatives,
known as the Clusia, produce a sticky resin that is collected by a
specialized group of bees, known as meliponine bees. The bees use
the resins to defend themselves by globbing the sticky substance,
for example, on attacking ants.
</P>
<P>
   They also use it for building nests. To their surprise,
researchers found that the tiny Paleoclusia flowers also contained
resin canals and had what appeared to be resin residue inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said: `How can this be? We have no record of these bees
this early,''' said Crepet, creating a paradox of elaborate resin
production in the absence of an animal that could use it. But
nearby amber deposits have since yielded an unexpectedly ancient
meliponine bee of just the right age to be visiting Paleoclusia,
suggesting this intimate relationship has been intact for at least
90 million years.
</P>
<P>
   Another striking discovery was the oldest fossil of an important
group of flowering plants known as monocots and including grass,
wheat and orchids. To the surprise of botanists, the oldest known
fossil of this familiar group was nothing like most modern
monocots: Instead, it belonged to an unusual group, known as the
Triurids.
</P>
<P>
   Triurids are leafless and do not contain chlorophyll and so are
not green and do not photosynthesize. Instead they make their
living from decaying matter, like fallen leaves. All evidence so
far suggests that the oldest fossil relatives of familiar green
plants like corn or lilies were ancient Triurids, which made no use
of the sun and instead lived off the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The site, undoubtedly full of many more botanical treasures is
considered an endangered locality, one for which the National
Science Foundation saw fit to finance research out of fear that it
would soon be destroyed. Once a relatively accessible sand and clay
pit, the site known as the Old Crossman Pit has been prepared for
construction, possibly warehouses, with a housing development, a
railway and highways already on its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say they have hoarded 26 tons of sediment and stored
it in upstate New York, their insurance against the time when they
will no longer be able to dig on this private property.
</P>
<P>
   One mystery that remains is why the flowers ended up as tiny
charcoal fossils at all. Scientists agree that the fossils were
created by fire, but there is controversy over whether the flowers
burned while still on plants or while in the leaf litter, whether
they went up in flames or smoldered.
</P>
<P>
   Something, however, about the events invites perfect
preservation generally. Gandolfo said that a fossil mite, whose
tiny leg joints could still be made to move as they had 90 million
years ago, had been recovered from the site.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of sediment and hours of electron microscopy later,
scientists say the thrill over these precious finds continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the first to see many fossil species,'' said Gandolfo,
who is still awestruck at being the very first human being to set
eyes on the oldest monocot flowers known, a species that came and
went before the dawn of humanity. ``Everything is new. It's very
exciting.''

ONLINE SALE OF CONTACT LENSES RAISES HEALTH CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Buying contact lenses has never been easier. Besides the
traditional outlets, like optometrists' offices and mail order
stores, they can be found on hundreds of Web sites and even at
beauty salons and local flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   But while this explosion of suppliers has held down prices, it
has created a problem, in the view of eye doctors, school nurses
and contact lens manufacturers: Growing numbers of people are
getting contact lenses illegally, without prescriptions, and they
are suffering from health problems as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a number of cases of conjunctivitis in teen-agers
who had gotten contact lenses over the Internet without a
prescription,'' said Dr. Walter M. Fierson, a pediatric
ophthalmologist in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold P. Koller, an ophthalmologist in suburban
Philadelphia, agreed. ``I'm seeing an increase in problems like
corneal infections,'' he said, adding that many of these patients
admitted that they had either bought their contact lenses without a
prescription or were wearing lenses they had borrowed from friends.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in such patients led Fierson to conduct his own
investigation. He had a part-time employee try to order contact
lenses online. While most of Web sites asked for prescription
information and the name of a doctor, he said, some did not contact
the doctor for verification.
</P>
<P>
   Fierson said the lack of verification was especially common when
his staff member tried to order cosmetic contact lenses, which have
become extremely popular in recent years, especially with
teen-agers. Such lenses change the color or appearance of the eyes
without necessarily correcting vision.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cosmetic lenses do not correct vision, they are still
considered prescription devices under federal law and cannot be
sold without a prescription indicating the size and shape of the
eyes. Lenses that fit improperly can deprive the cornea of oxygen
and cause corneal abrasions, leaving the eyes vulnerable to
infections that can cause permanent vision loss, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers are at especially high risk for two reasons. Doctors
say they are more likely than adults to buy the lenses without a
prescription. And being teen-agers, they can be careless about
hygiene: wearing lenses for too long, neglecting to sterilize them,
even swapping them with friends.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many outlets sell contact lenses without
verifying prescriptions. But isolated investigations have borne out
Fierson's findings. Last summer Keith Cole of Austin, an employee
of the Texas Optometry Board, clicked on 1-800 Contacts, a Web site
that sells lenses.
</P>
<P>
   He typed in his order, gave his name, address and billing
information and a doctor's name and phone number, and the lenses
arrived by mail five days later. Cole says he got the lenses
without being asked to provide a written prescription from a
licensed physician.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Cole's accusations, the Texas Optometry Board
filed a lawsuit against 1-800 Contacts in October, saying it had
illegally sold contact lenses without a prescription. The Kansas
State Board of Examiners of Optometry has filed a similar lawsuit
against the company.
</P>
<P>
   The company denies these accusations. ``We call the doctor in
every case,'' said Jonathan Coon, the chief executive of 1-800
Contacts, based in Draper, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The Wesley Jessen Corp., which makes Wild Eyes, a leading brand
of cosmetic lenses, hired a private investigator to order its
lenses from Web sites, beauty salons and flea markets. The company
says it has found dozens of outlets selling its lenses without
verifying prescription information.
</P>
<P>
   Companies found to be selling Wild Eyes illegally get a letter
from Wesley Jessen's lawyers. ``I send letters every week,'' said
Martha Brecher, a lawyer for the company, which is based in Des
Plaines, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Wesley Jessen's lawyers wrote to two prominent
Internet companies, Yahoo and eBay, after finding that contact
lenses were being auctioned on their Web sites. Both companies
stopped the auctions when they learned that selling contact lenses
without a prescription was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Now that doctors are seeing harmful consequences from the
illegal trade in contact lenses, health organizations are beginning
to take action. The Contact Lens Council, a trade association, is
about to propose legislation to Congress that would require a hard
copy of a prescription before contact lenses could be sold. And the
American Academy of Pediatrics is preparing guidelines for primary
care physicians to use in educating teen-agers about the safe use
of contact lenses, since they are the prime market for cosmetic
contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AAP wants to get the message to teen-agers not to share
contact lenses or get them without a prescription,'' Koller said.
``And if they have lenses that they got without a prescription, we
want to tell them to have them checked out by a doctor.''

   Q. What is the difference between dentists with D.D.S. after
their names and those with D.M.D.?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no difference between the two degrees, according to
the education division of the American Dental Association in
Chicago. One stands for doctor of dental surgery and the other
means doctor of dental medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Each is a degree awarded upon graduation from a dental school
after studying to become a general dentist.
</P>
<P>
   The two kinds of dentists have the same education, but
universities have the prerogative to determine which degree is
awarded, much as a bachelor's degree in the arts can be a Bachelor
of Arts (B.A.), or in modern Latin, Artium Baccalaureus (A.B.).
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen institutions grant D.M.D. degrees and 36 grant D.D.S.
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, dental schools require three or more years of
undergraduate education plus four years of dental school to
graduate and become a general dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Additional postgraduate training is required to become a dental
specialist, like a periodontist or orthodontist. The training
generally requires two to four years, depending on the specialty.
</P>
<P>
   The specialists may be granted certificates or master's degrees,
again, depending on the institution they attend, but it is up to
the schools to decide what additional ``paper'' they provide, and
the degree or certificate is not mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   There are nine specialities recognized by the ADA: pediatric
dentistry, periodontics, prosthodontics, oral and maxillofacial
surgery, oral and maxillofacial pathology, dental public health,
orthodontics, and oral and maxillofacial radiology.
</P>
<P>
   The additional training can be quite extensive. For example,
programs for a combined specialty in prosthodontics (the
replacement of missing teeth) and maxillofacial prosthetics (the
use of artificial substitutes for missing jaw and facial
structures) generally take 45 months.
</P>
<P>
   The ADA maintains a Web site for more information on dental
careers and other oral health topics: www.ada.org. &QL;

BREAST CANCER RISKS CAN START IN THE WOMB 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass., Ala., Calif., N.C., Japan) (nk) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Seeking to better understand the origins of breast cancer,
researchers have begun to look as far back as the womb to identify
prenatal factors and childhood experiences, including birth weight,
diet and exercise patterns, that may affect a woman's risk of
developing breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Though the data are preliminary, the relationships complex and
the conclusions tentative, the emerging findings may help to
explain long-suspected influences on breast cancer risk like early
puberty, the age of a woman at the end of her first full-term
pregnancy and the amount of fat and calories in her diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidence is accumulating, though the research is still in its
very early phases, that the periods before and soon after birth,
childhood and early adolescence are much more important to breast
cancer risk than had been appreciated,'' said Dr. Karin B. Michels,
clinical epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston. ``Just as heart disease has its origins
in childhood, breast cancer is not just an adult disease.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, there is a strong link between high-fat diets in
the population and high rates of breast cancer, but at best a weak
relationship to the amount of fat an individual woman consumes as
an adult. But the effects of fat in a child's diet may explain why
Japanese women who emigrate to the United States maintain their low
risk of breast cancer, while the risk faced by their American-born
daughters and granddaughters approaches that of white American
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Migration studies reveal that racial factors play only a minor
role and that environmental or lifestyle factors, or both, are far
more important,'' Dr. Jaak Ph. Janssens, a Belgian expert on
hormonal factors in cancer wrote in an article in a recent issue of
the journal Nutrition Today.
</P>
<P>
   Janssens, who studies hormones and breast cancer at the L.
Willems Institute and Limburg University Center in Diepenbeek,
Belgium, suggested that breast cancer risk might in part be
determined by the kind of diet a woman consumed as a child and even
what her mother ate during pregnancy _ if the diets were high in
calories, and especially if they were rich in animal fat.
</P>
<P>
   Animal studies have also suggested that a prenatal diet rich in
polyunsaturated fats, which includes most vegetable oils, can
increase the susceptibility of fetal breast tissue to the
cancer-stimulating effects of estrogen. Several studies in adults
have indicated that monounsaturated fats like olive or canola oil
are protective.
</P>
<P>
   The high-calorie diet typically consumed by Americans fosters
the production of estrogens associated with early puberty and early
menarche, both of which are already linked to breast cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to protective or harmful substances soon after birth
may be particularly critical. Janssens said newborn rats treated
with genistein, an estrogen in soy, were less susceptible to
carcinogens that caused breast cancer and had a reduced rate of
mammary tumors throughout life. He suggested that part of this
protection might result from genistein's effects on the growth of
mammary tissue in newborns, resulting in structures that were less
susceptible to cancer. This finding may explain why the protective
effect of the Asian diet appears to occur early in a girl's life.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is the exposure of newborns to environmental
chemicals that simulate the action of estrogens. For example,
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, are weak estrogens that can
accumulate in body fat and are passed to nursing newborns in breast
milk. These chemicals' effects on cancer risk are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walter Rogan, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, N.C., said
studies of the effects of PCB's on breast cancer risk had produced
inconsistent findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese have high levels of PCB's in their bodies, but
they don't have high levels of breast cancer,'' Rogan said in an
interview. He added that DDE, a breakdown product of DDT, was a
more potent estrogen than PCB's and that high levels of DDE were
found in China, India and Mexico, where breast cancer rates are
low.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of diet on breast cancer risk may well start in the
womb. Based on data from the continuing Nurses' Health Study at
Harvard, Michels, the Harvard epidemiologist, and colleagues found
a clear link between birth weight and later risk of breast cancer:
The bigger the baby, the greater the risk. Since a baby's birth
weight is largely determined by how much weight a woman gains
during pregnancy, Michels said, she is concerned about the current
tendency to allow pregnant women to gain a great deal of weight.
</P>
<P>
   Also worrisome, for more reasons than a possible increase in
breast cancer risk, is the precipitous rise in childhood obesity
and a concurrent decline in physical activity in the United States.
Both body fat and inactivity can increase blood levels of estrogen.
Janssens explained that for estrogen to activate cell growth, it
must circulate freely in the blood serum or be bound to a blood
protein, albumin. Estrogens that are bound to a protein called sex
hormone binding globulin, or SHBG, are not biologically active.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutrition can induce changes in the fraction of estrogens
bound to the serum proteins and, therefore, can enhance or decrease
the action of estrogens on highly susceptible target organs'' like
a woman's breasts, Janssens wrote. ``Fruits and vegetables, which
seem to increase SHBG binding, are protective with regard to
estrogen stimulation.'' Animal fat, he wrote, decreases this
binding, and thus increases the amount of estrogen available to
stimulate tissue growth.
</P>
<P>
   Janssens also noted that obese girls and women were less able to
bind estrogens and that extra estrogens were produced in their body
fat, resulting in more estrogen freely circulating in blood and
able to stimulate breast tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``High calorie diets that are low in fruits and vegetables can
induce puberty at an earlier age and facilitate estrogen action on
the highly susceptible target organ of the breast,'' he said. ``The
available data suggest that such a dietary pattern should be
avoided for many reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Vigorous activity not only promotes leanness and delays puberty,
it also slows the onset of menarche with its high levels of
estrogen and diminishes the frequency of ovulation in menstruating
girls, which also lowers exposure to hormones that stimulate the
breast. Delayed menarche has long been known to protect against
breast cancer by reducing exposure to estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that regular exercise, especially in youth,
can reduce breast cancer risk. In 1985, Dr. Rose Frisch of Harvard
University published a tantalizing finding: Radcliffe graduates who
had been student athletes had significantly lower rates of breast
cancer as adults than did their less active classmates.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits to the breast of exercise in adult women are less
clear, although a study of more than 1,000 women by Dr. Leslie
Bernstein, preventive medicine specialist at the University of
Southern California in Los Angeles, found that premenopausal women
who engaged in just three hours of moderate exercise a week had a
30 percent lower risk of breast cancer and those who got four or
more hours of exercise each week had a 50 percent lower risk.
</P>
<P>
   Those who benefited most, experiencing 60 percent less breast
cancer than inactive women, had been active in their teens and
early 20s as well as later in life.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the less estrogen a woman is exposed to _ from fetal
life through childhood and adulthood _ the lower her risk of
developing breast cancer. Early menopause, which results from a
loss of estrogens produced by the ovaries, has long been known to
reduce breast cancer risk. Women whose ovaries are removed in their
30s and who take no hormone replacement have up to 75 percent less
breast cancer than women who undergo natural menopause at around
age 50, Janssens noted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Malcolm Pike, a hormone researcher at the University of
Southern California in Los Angeles, said in an interview that
Japanese women on a traditional low-fat, high-fiber diet routinely
produced 25 percent less estradiol than American women did.
Estradiol is an estrogen that is considered an important promoter
of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Pike suggested that American women might be able to achieve the
Japanese pattern of estrogen production and low breast cancer risk
by adopting, from childhood on, a diet that derived less than 10
percent of its calories from fat and that was at least twice as
rich in fiber as the current American diet.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Americans derive about 34 percent of their calories
from fat, much of it animal fat, and few American women consume
less than 20 percent fat calories at any stage of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could get rid of 85 percent of American breast cancer by
starting with 10-year-olds,'' Pike said, ``keeping them on a
low-fat, high-fiber diet, exercising them heavily and keeping them
slim.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts maintain that Asian women are protected by their
lifelong high intake of soy, which is rich in weak plant estrogens
_ isoflavones like genistein _ that may block the action of a
woman's own estrogen. Pike said the jury was still out on that
question.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Messina and colleagues at the University of Alabama in
Birmingham suggested that soy might be protective in part because
it increased the length of a woman's menstrual cycle, which is
associated with a lower risk of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But in adults, Pike said, studies of soy's effects on breast
cancer had produced conflicting results, with some studies
suggesting that plant-based estrogens, especially in large
quantities, might promote, not prevent, breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he suggested: ``Soy in the Asian diet may just be a
marker substance for a diet that is very low in animal fat. At this
point, we just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors that seem to reduce breast cancer risk are
pregnancy at an early age and prolonged nursing. But the experts
concede that the age of a woman at the end of her first pregnancy
(if indeed she gets pregnant), how long she can breast-feed and the
age at which she undergoes menopause are less amenable to
modification than eating and exercise habits.
</P>
<P>
   Until more conclusive data emerges, Michels and Pike suggested
that the best way for women to reduce their risk of breast cancer
might be to stay thin, eat a very low-fat diet and get plenty of
physical exercise _ from the womb to the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Janssens advised, ``Even small changes in overall intake of
estrogenic substances, decreases in animal fat consumption and
increases in fruit and vegetable fiber could result in dramatic
changes in breast cancer risk later in life.''

WHAT 3 FAMOUS NONHUMANS WANT FOR CHRISTMAS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Wednesday, Dec. 22)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christmas wish list of some of America's most famous (nonhuman)
celebrities as told to the psychic who seems to be in a trance 24
hours a day, Madame Davida:
</P>
<P>
   Tony the Tiger
</P>
<P>
   _ Anything but Frosted Flakes. They may have been GREAT! the
first time, but now all they do is hurt my teeth. Besides, I'm a
carnivore. I eat meat, not sugary cereals. I watched ``Who Wants to
be a Millionaire'' the other night and I must say that Regis
Philbin looks mighty tasty. Final answer? Actually, no. Some people
might miss Regis. Give me Martha Stewart instead. Maybe with a
clove-studded baked apple in her mouth. That would add a nice,
festive touch.
</P>
<P>
   Lassie
</P>
<P>
   _ How about a new family to live with? You say that's a cold,
disloyal thing for a dog to ask for? I'll tell you what, pal. You
live with Timmy and the rest of the Martin family for 24 hours and
you'll be begging for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   That Timmy, I don't know. Maybe they dropped him on his head
when he was a baby or maybe it's a genetic thing, but the boy ain't
right. All he's got to do is walk out the door and _ BOOM! _ he
either falls down a mine shaft or gets cornered by a mountain lion.
Or both. You'd think his parents would take him aside and say,
``Son, you need to watch where the hell you're walking. This is
getting old.'' But that never happens. In fact, if it weren't for
me barking like crazy and pawing at their legs, I doubt they'd ever
realize Timmy was missing. These people are dense, I'm telling you.
</P>
<P>
   More than once I've had to type them a letter:
</P>
<P>
   Yo, Martins! Your doofus son, Timmy, has fallen down a mine
shaft. Again! There are currently six mountain lions, two grizzly
bears and a rather confused elk waiting in line to eat him. I
realize that you are very busy right now, watching the dust motes
float across the sunbeams and everything, so if it's OK with you, I
will go rescue him all by myself. Again!
</P>
<P>
   Love, Lassie
</P>
<P>
   P.S _ You people need counseling. Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. _ I'm leaving you the first chance I get.
</P>
<P>
   Wile E. Coyote (Hard-Headipus ravenus)
</P>
<P>
   _ Money. Send me money. Lots of it. I'm drowning in debt. The
Acme Corp. sent me a letter the other day threatening legal action
if I don't pay up. Seems I owe them $76,304.87 for various products
I've bought from them over the years including the Giant Slingshot,
Rocket-Powered Sled, Rocket-Powered Roller Skates, Self-Guided
Aerial Bomb, ``Little Giant'' Firecracker, Spring-Loaded Shoes,
Giant Kite and various catapults, harpoons, robots and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   All of these products, as you surely know, not only failed to
perform as advertised but caused me grievous physical harm,
including but not limited to fractures; contusions; abrasions;
severe singeing of the hair of the head, neck and muzzle;
flattening of the cranium; spinal compression and a compound
fracture of the left ear, causing it to dangle with a creaking
noise.
</P>
<P>
   My medical bills, as of today, total $3,894,211, all of which
falls on me since I am self-employed and not eligible for Workers
Compensation.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the not-insignificant matter of my attorneys' fees
as I seek (thus far unsuccessfully) compensation from the Acme
Corp. for personal injuries, loss of business income and mental
suffering resulting from Acme's gross negligence.
</P>
<P>
   This bill, at present, totals roughly $800,000, give or take a
hundred-thousand, bringing the total bill to $4,770,515.87.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't send me any money, the head of the Road Runner
(Velocitus delectiblus) would also be nice.

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: HOLD THE CHAMPAGNE, RUSSIA'S NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By Charles W. Holmes 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Kremlin on Monday called Sunday's parliamentary
elections ``a peaceful revolution.'' Analysts said that voters
opted for political stability. And international lenders said the
outcome means better times ahead for the country's crippled
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the success of political moderates in the
elections has given fresh hope to Russia's long-stalled efforts to
improve its unstable market economy and corruption-riddled
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that while the atmosphere has changed, the
political landscape remains unpredictable and treacherous,
particularly as Russia gears up for a more momentous election next
summer _ the race to replace President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the new Duma and the prospects of political and
economic progress in Russia rest almost exclusively with Yeltsin's
chosen successor, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, and the war he has
waged against separatists in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   At 47, Putin is Russia's most popular politician this decade and
the man most likely to succeed the highly unpopular Yeltsin as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Voters gave stronger-than-expected support to four moderate and
pro-reform parties who will control about half the seats in the
450-member Duma, the lower house. It was a clear victory for
Yeltsin and the Kremlin, whose new Unity Party finished a close
second to Russia's largest party, the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's success came largely because Russians admire and
support Putin. His popular appeal has come, in turn, from his
leadership of the war against Islamic guerrillas in Chechnya, a
brutal conflict that large numbers of Russians view as a just fight
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   With so much staked on Putin and the war, the possibilities of
what could happen between now and the presidential elections in
June are daunting. Consider what took place over the last half-year
in Russia to effect the parliamentary elections: Five months ago,
Putin was an unknown ex-spy and bureaucrat before Yeltsin appointed
him prime minister. Four months ago, the war in Chechnya was
dormant. And three months ago, the Unity party did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Among the risks ahead for Russia's political stability:
</P>
<P>
   CHECHNYA. The popular war served as the key tool for the
Kremlin, building support for Unity and crippling opposition
efforts to focus the campaign on Russia's meager economy and
Yeltsin's ineffective leadership.
</P>
<P>
   . The three-month military campaign has been successful so far.
But Russian troops have yet to capture the capital, Grozny, and
they risk attacks from determined fighters dug in to positions in
the city and in Chechnya's southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the longer Russian forces remain in Chechnya, the
greater their risk of losses, and the chance that public opinion
could turn against the war and Putin.
</P>
<P>
   YELTSIN. Putin was appointed in August. He was Yeltsin's fifth
prime minister in 17 months, compounding at the time the political
uncertainty that had existed since Russia's economic collapse of
mid-1998. Analysts say Putin is safe from sacking while he remains
high in the polls. But many analysts believe he would be out should
the war turn for the worse, or should Kremlin insiders feel that he
would not look after their power and business interests as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constitution, most power is in the hands of the
erratic and ailing Yeltsin, 68. He is surrounded and supported by a
group of influential business tycoons and close advisers _ known as
``the family'' _ who have bent and swayed policy to suit their
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote concentrates an awful lot of power in the existing
elite. The issue is really what they do with that power _ whether
they are going to abuse it in the way they did from 1996 to
mid-1998 or whether they are going to be more responsible with
it,'' said Tom Adshead, political analyst at Troika Dialog
brokerage in Moscow
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS. Despite the election of Unity and other centrist
parties, the pro-reform groups may be unable to form a workable
union in the Duma. Or if they forge a pro-government coalition,
rivalries among personalities who have their own presidential
aspirations could hamper progress.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest chance for improvement, analysts say, again rests
with Putin. His endorsement of Unity was key to the new party's
election success. Using similar leverage, Putin could force the
Duma to action if parliament members felt they would incur the
wrath of the public for countering the widely admired prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, everything depends now on Putin's rating,'' said the
newspaper Izvestiya in a commentary Monday.

&HT;     MAYOR SAYS HE WON'T SEEK ANOTHER POST WHILE IN OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown, who was forced into a
run-off election against a write-in candidate last month, says he
will not run for higher office for as long as he is mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My history has been one of staying put,'' Brown, 65, said.
``When I'm turned out, there may be an opportunity to do something
else. But I'm not one of those politicians who's constantly looking
for the next rung.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a Democrat who led the state Assembly before running for
mayor in 1995, said the law should be changed to force politicians
running for another office to first resign from the job they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, you would find most of us real restrained about
how we exercise our options,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's hour-long appearance Sunday at Grace Episcopal
Cathedral's Gresham Hall was part of a series of
cathedral-sponsored forums. About 200 people attended the event,
including many who stood in the back after the chairs were filled.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, dressed in a dapper chocolate-brown suit and sitting in
front of a crimson curtain, conversed briefly with the Very Rev.
Alan Jones before a handful of audience members were allowed to
pose polite inquiries into the mayor's plans for the city in his
second term. The questions largely revolved around Brown's plans to
address concerns such as housing costs and the plight of the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest goal, the mayor said, is to ``have the city be
affordable for all people,'' whether it be access to housing,
medical care or the public education of their choice. If he can do
that, he said, he will have ``kept the faith'' of the people who
voted for him.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, also a Democrat,
surprised Brown and two other leading candidates by finishing
second in the general election last month, forcing Brown into a
run-off contest because no candidate won more than 50 percent of
the vote. But the incumbent rallied, beating Ammiano 60 percent to
40 percent in the Dec. 14 election.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also defended his pro-development positions to one woman
in the audience who complained that too many lofts and chain stores
are crowding her neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lofts would not exist in this city if there was not a loft
market,'' he said, explaining his support of such developments and
the ``dot.com kids'' who inhabit them.
</P>
<P>
   Technology workers and other newcomers pour millions of dollars
into the economy, Brown said, helping to fund dozens of improvement
projects. Besides, he said, not a single loft has replaced any
residential housing in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot roll up the drawbridge, seed the moat with piranhas
and go inside the castle and say that no one else should enter,''
he added. ``This is a city.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown received a standing ovation from nearly half the crowd at
the end of the event, and about a dozen people huddled around him
afterward to shake his hand, congratulate him on his mayoral
victory or have a personal conversation with him.
</P>
<P>
   David Campbell was one of those who approached Brown to tell him
of his concern that some longtime San Francisco families can no
longer afford to live in the city. Brown assured him that would be
a major focus of his administration in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought of him as a very personable person, but
I'd never had the chance to speak with him one-on-one,'' said
Campbell, a 37-year-old San Francisco resident who works for a
nonprofit organization in Palo Alto.

KEYES SCORING IN DEBATES, NOT POLLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ For the rest of the presidential candidates
at the televised gathering, part of last week's Republican debate
was a discussion about the merits of ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   No, the argument over subsidies for farmers who convert corn
into fuel, he said, ignores a much larger problem, one that strikes
at the very heart of America's moral courage and decency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks look at the family farming system like the only thing we
get from family farms is the food,'' said Keyes, his soft voice
belying the explosive oratory that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates, having grown accustomed to the eloquent
but piercing admonitions from the former Reagan administration
official, knew that fireworks were on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes' voice dripped with indignation: ``We lose the family
farm,'' he boomed, ``and we lose the nursery of America's moral
character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did we get the young men and women who were willing to
sacrifice themselves in battle, rise to the extraordinary tests of
war every time we asked them to, have the courage that used to be
restricted supposedly only to aristocrats?'' he asked, providing
the answer after hardly a breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found them in the fields of America, behind the plow,
nurtured in the family farms of this country. We cannot let that
die, any more than we can let America's heart and individuality and
courage die.''
</P>
<P>
   It was classic Keyes: taking an arcane subject and turning it
into an emotion-packed, crowd-pleasing pronouncement. Mesmerizing
speeches roll effortlessly from his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   That Keyes is an effective debater is hardly a subject for
debate. Even a senior adviser to Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP
presidential front-runner, acknowledges that the former radio
commentator blows his competition out of the water in contests such
as last week's debate in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were about how well you do in debates,'' the adviser
said afterward, ``he'd be 50 points ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes is not 50 points ahead, and winning presidential contests
entails more than scoring points in debates. Keyes barely registers
in many polls across the nation, and his last campaign finance
statement showed him with about $50,000 available to spend.
</P>
<P>
   But don't talk about polls to Keyes, or to his small but loyal
band of supporters. He calls opinion surveys ``fiction'' and said
the news media's fascination with them is ``dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the end they (polls) can become an instrument for
turning our electoral system into a sham,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keyes was born in New York City into a family steeped in
military tradition and order. His father was an Army sergeant, and
the family moved around a lot. The future presidential candidate
grew up in segregationist Georgia and spent time in Italy and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Robert G. Coleman High School in San Antonio
while his father was stationed at Fort Sam Houston. Even then an
award-winning debater, Keyes said he was politically curious from
an early age, even though his parents were not active on that
front.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes briefly attended Cornell University but left, partially
because he opposed the Vietnam War protests and the forceful
takeover of a campus building by rifle-toting black students.
According to college pal Marlo Lewis, Keyes received death threats
for speaking out against his fellow black students.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, whose wife works for the Keyes 2000 campaign, recalls the
young Keyes as ``brilliant, original and funny, with sort of just a
great love of life.''
</P>
<P>
   He also remembers that Keyes, a talented singer and musician,
briefly considered a career as an opera singer and toyed with the
idea of following his father into the military. The elder Keyes
persuaded him not to.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, who received student deferments and was not drafted into
service in Vietnam after receiving a high lottery number, never
served in the military.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewis, Keyes' father told him, ``I fought in three
wars so you wouldn't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes received his bachelor of arts degree from Harvard
University in 1972 and his doctorate from Harvard in 1979, then
joined the U.S. diplomatic service. He served a stint as U.S. vice
consul in Bombay, India, where he met Jocelyn Marcel. They married
and have three children.
</P>
<P>
   While in the diplomatic service, Keyes was noticed by Jeane
Kirkpatrick, then the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. She
helped get him appointed U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Economic and
Social Council, on which he served from 1983 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He was then named assistant secretary of state for international
organizations; he clashed with a superior, whom he accused of
treating him in a racially demeaning fashion. The official denied
the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes also became a chief spokesman for the Reagan
administration's policy of ``constructive engagement'' with South
Africa, meaning that he opposed sanctions against the
white-minority government.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   He remains unapologetic for that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that it represents a very sound approach to those
societies that are open to our influence,'' he said, calling South
Africa ``relatively free.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were all kinds of bad disparities and oppressions for
blacks, but you did have access to people, you did have access to
newspapers, you did have access to labor unions, you did have an
ability to influence the society through its internal economic
workings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly added that the approach would not work in a place
such as China, where, he said, communist dictators deny basic
freedoms, ``play us for fools'' and repress their people with U.S.
complicity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keyes developed his first taste for election campaigns when he
was recruited by Maryland Republicans to run against Democratic
U.S. Sen. Paul Sarbanes in 1988. He garnered 40 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he again won the GOP nomination, but this time
ran against Sen. Barbara Mikulski and got 29 percent of the vote.
He was harshly criticized that year for taking the unusual step of
paying himself a monthly salary of $8,500 from campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   He defended the practice but abandoned it in both of his
presidential races _ in 1996 and this year.
</P>
<P>
   A ferocious opponent of abortion, Keyes argues that the United
States is in a serious moral crisis, and he does not miss an
opportunity to cast political dialogue in those absolutist terms.
</P>
<P>
   During the exchange in Des Moines, for example, he took a shot
at Bush's ``leave no child behind,'' slogan, declaring: ``We are
not leaving unborn children behind. We are killing them.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that abortion should be illegal in all cases except
to save the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes also favors abolishing the income tax, which he would
replace with a national sales tax that would provide exemptions for
certain basic items, such as food, medicine and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   That, he says, would allow people to gain control of the money
they earn by consuming less.
</P>
<P>
   His solution for campaign finance reform is similarly audacious:
allow only people who can vote to contribute _ meaning no money
from labor unions, corporations or political action committees _ at
any level they wish.
</P>
<P>
   But Keyes rejects the notion that he is calling for radical
reform, because ``in most cases they're simply a return to the
fundamental principles of this country.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A staunch foe of race-based affirmative action, Keyes said he
possibly benefited from such programs as a college student,
although he calls that point ``irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people who benefited from segregation. Did
that mean that they should have supported its perpetuation? Once
you know that something is an injustice, you move to stop it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes has not hesitated to criticize the news media for what he
calls institutional prejudice, complaining that outlets have
repeatedly left his name out of news stories because they can't
adjust to a black politician who is a conservative Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent appearance on Fox's ``Hannity and Colmes'' show,
Keyes accused host Alan Colmes of bias for applauding his
oratorical skills, comparing the compliment to saying, ``Oh, he
dances real well.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Keyes has often cited his stellar debate
performances _ including surveys showing that voters judged him the
winner _ as proof that he is the best candidate.
</P>
<P>
   After the Des Moines appearance, Keyes told reporters that his
strong showing has begun to affect the race. The other candidates
have begun appropriating his ideas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take great pleasure and pride in the fact that the other
candidates are, yes, learning how to talk about these serious
issues from me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But wouldn't you rather have the master as president of the
United States?'' Keyes asked. ``Wouldn't you rather have the
instructor as the leader rather than those who have followed his
lead?''
</P>
<P>
   That depends on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   As Keyes hurried out of the downtown Des Moines civic center to
an array of TV trucks, one of them waiting to beam live images of
him across the nation, a young college student stopped to pay him a
familiar compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Keyes!'' shrieked Liz Crokin, 20. ``You're an amazing
orator.'' Keyes quietly thanked her and stepped in front of the
camera.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whom she's voting for, Crokin said, ``Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think Keyes is a great speaker,'' she said. ``He's
just so extreme sometimes, it seems.''

A NEW WAY TO HEAL WOUNDS AND KEEP FRIENDSHIPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, my wife and I ironed out a domestic spat via
e-mail. I messaged (is that a verb now?) her from work; she replied
from her computer at home. Then we spent the morning trading
electronic bouquets. I also visit regularly online with my parents
in Minnesota and a good friend in Pittsburgh. Nothing profound,
generally, just the small details of life that get lost in the time
between long-distance telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   So a concession seems in order. To me, at least until now,
progress in the electronic age has been synonymous with
depersonalization, with the prospect of bleary-eyed computer
addicts more comfortable with virtual reality than the messier
verities of life in the flesh. But it is now apparent to me and a
few hundred million others: We are connecting _ real human to real
human _ across distances great and small with a speed and frequency
unprecedented in the annals of human communication. And this can
only be good.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article in ``The New Yorker'' magazine estimated that
400 million e-mailboxes exist worldwide, but the number grows
faster than anyone's ability to keep count. The number of e-mail
messages surpassed those sent by so-called ``snail mail'' four
years ago, the article said. A large percentage of these messages
pertain to business, of course. But millions more concern matters
of the heart _ friends reconnecting with ancient friends; husbands
like me making amends to wives, or vice versa (e-mail, I'm told, is
now used in marriage counseling); relatives catching up with other
relatives. By now you have your own Hallmarkian e-mail tale.
</P>
<P>
   Today, even communication experts lapse into the warm and fuzzy
when e-mail is the topic. Debby Andrews, for one, a professor at
the University of Delaware, teaches e-mail protocol to her
communication students, how to address your boss online, and so
forth. But in a recent interview, she seemed more inclined to talk
about e-mail's salutary effects in her own life. There is the link
to an elderly uncle in Texas, she says, and the daily messages to a
sister who lives in another city.
</P>
<P>
   And the professor's voice flutters when she speaks of e-mail and
her marriage. Andrews commutes between the Delaware campus and her
home in Maine. Her husband frequently travels. So for them, Andrews
says, the blinking cursor is the ``new hearth,'' with a ``seductive
pull,'' the place where the small details of life are passed back
and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is the tie that binds,'' Andrews says. ``We feel close
because we can send e-mail. My eyes light up when I look at my
index and there's a message from him.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, there's no real mystery to this communication
revolution. E-mail is cheap. It's easy, missives constructed in the
flash of a few keystrokes, and zipped away, all at the convenience
of the sender. Same for replies. No more untimely phone calls from
old friends who want to catch up, just when the third period of the
televised hockey game begins, or the latest episode of ``ER''
reaches its dramatic crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, through e-mail, latent letter writers are flexing
their literary muscles. Even those who don't write for a living are
finding new pleasure in the well-crafted sentence, or the thought
or feeling eloquently conveyed. The letter, once languishing on
societal life support, now seems as fit and vital as a yearling.
</P>
<P>
   Writer Adam Gopnik goes so far as to proclaim e-mail ``the
literary event of the late century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, even the most literate of us wrote maybe a half
dozen letters a year; the rest of our lives took place on the
telephone. ... Yet it seems a good bet that in 200 years people
will be reading someone's collected e-mail the way we read Edmund
Wilson's letters or Pepys' diaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``... multitudes have found a nearly forgotten friendship
suddenly made intimate again, because of e-mail, and are attentive
once more to their sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   But I submit that the real explanation behind e-mail's stunning
emergence is something more subtle than the cost of it, or ease, or
the bliss of self-discovered e-mail poets. Instead, the real
explanation for its popularity is e-mail's relative anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Admit it, for most of us, face-to-face communication remains one
of life's most chronically stressful endeavors. We are tyrannized
by our conversation partner's nonverbal cues _ the facial
expression, the body language, the tone of voice. We as a species
desperately aim to please, and if a furrowed brow indicates that's
not happening, well, you know the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail removes the threat of the furrowed brow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anonymity thing; it's kind of like talking to someone in
the dark,'' says Amanda Hutchens, an e-mail devotee from Fort
Worth, Texas. ``You can share more honestly. I prefer doing it that
way. I don't see disdain in the face or in the eyes or anything
else. There's no judgment.''

UNDATED: no judgment. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gopnik concurs with the anonymity theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new appeal of e-mail is the old appeal of print,'' he
writes. ``It isn't instant; it isn't immediate; it isn't in your
face. Written language gives you a hat and a Groucho nose and
glasses; it's you there, but not quite you. E-mail has succeeded
brilliantly for the same reason that videophone failed miserably:
What we actually want from our exchanges is the minimum contact
commensurate with the need to connect with other people.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Which leads finally to e-mail's annoyances, pitfalls and
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   First, to get to the heartwarming personal message, we
invariably must wade through the electronic junk mail, called spam.
Between 15 and 30 percent of the e-mail received by Americans
online is spam, and the problem is likely to get worse, according
to a recent article in ``The Boston Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a whole new set of etiquette questions generated by the
e-mail emergence, causing Judith Martin, aka Miss Manners, to
devote several columns to the topic. An e-mail message bears the
formal weight of a postcard, Miss Manners says, so if you wouldn't
deliver tragic or deeply unpleasant tidings by postcard, neither
should e-mail be put to that use. Nor are e-mail messages
substitutes for greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   Nuance is often a casualty of e-mail. Many an ironic gibe,
delivered online, has been misinterpreted, with painful
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   And then this troubling notion: The only real antidote to human
loneliness is face-to-face, or at least voice-to-voice, human
interaction, however daunting those interactions might be. E-mail,
then, is ultimately left wanting _ appetizer before the main meal.
In a perfect world, e-mail is just the precursor to the moment when
we swallow hard and actually call another human, or visit in
person.
</P>
<P>
   Making up online with your wife is one thing, but warmth and
companionship when together at home is the whole point. Deep and
abiding friendships require more than keyboard greetings. Another
e-mailer, Leslye Rood, of Tulsa, says that a few weeks ago, she
reconnected via e-mail with a close friend in Paris. That reunion,
like millions of others these days, might never have occurred
without the blinking cursor, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two of us did reconnect and did a little catching up''
with e-mail,) Rood says. ``But once the connection was made, e-mail
didn't fulfill our needs. We needed to talk. I needed to hear her
laugh, which is low and deep and round, and that fantastic French
accent which you don't get on e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   At least not yet. In a few years, the way these things move,
maybe French accents will be part of the package. For now we get to
share the little details with friends and family near and far, with
only a few keystrokes and for almost no charge. That is more than
we had before, much more, come to think of it.

 &HT;    STATE DEPARTMENT: Y2K MAY ATTRACT TERRORISTS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Terrorists may strike during the millennium
rollover to take advantage of media attention focused on the
``Y2K'' computer problem, a top State Department official warned
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Pickering, undersecretary of state for political affairs,
also said some terrorist leaders may feel that victims will be more
vulnerable if computer problems hinder authorities' ability to
respond to an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have individuals around the world and leaders of terrorist
groups. ... who would seek to exploit, in their view, a period when
they might feel world attention was focused either in the press on
events going on around the world or that there were weaknesses that
could be exploited,'' Pickering said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks came as other federal officials responded to last
week's arrest of an Algerian man trying to smuggle explosives into
Washington state from Canada:
</P>
<P>
   _ U.S. Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly said he was putting an
extra 300 inspectors on duty at points of entry into the country,
with particular attention to ``remote ports.''
</P>
<P>
   _ President Clinton's press secretary, Joe Lockhart, said the
president had been briefed on counterterrorism efforts in the
pre-New Year's period. ``That work is something that the president
has closely involved himself in and has done a lot of work on,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, said
officials know of no specific terror threats against targets in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering, co-chair of an international working group that has
been meeting throughout 1999 to plan for the New Year's holidays,
noted that the State Department warned several months ago of
possible terrorist activity in the earliest hours of the new
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have the beginning, at least, of some information that
indicates that our foresight was uncannily correct,'' Pickering
said, referring to the arrest in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the working group said the government was
well-prepared to provide assistance to American citizens traveling
abroad during New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   However, the department has issued four country-specific travel
warnings, suggesting that Americans defer trips to Russia, Ukraine,
Moldova and Belarus until after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Security at U.S. embassies and consular offices has been beefed
up, and the posts placed on a ``high state of alert and readiness
to respond to terrorism, civil disorder, disruptions of critical
local services and cyber-threats,'' said David Carpenter, assistant
secretary for diplomatic security.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-hour command-and-control center will be staffed at the
State Department's Washington office throughout the New Year's
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's Internet site (www.state.gov) has been
receiving between 250,000 and 600,000 visits a day, and the number
is expected to increase during the holidays, said Kevin Herbert,
director of overseas citizen services.

`SIDEWALK': EMBRACING STREET LIFE, WITH CAMERA AND HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture a scene common enough on New York's streets, especially
in the holiday season. Dodging panhandlers and improvised sidewalk
vendors, a mother threads her 5-year-old through the shopper
crowds. The mother fixes her gaze ahead; the child turns to gaze at
the slovenly figures displaying blanketsful of urban jetsam.
</P>
<P>
   As we get older, hyperopia takes us: a farsightedness of the
social as well as ophthalmological kind. It is hard to see what is
nearby. We are likely to know more about the homeless in Kosovo
than in New York. The imagination drifts to Samarkand and shuns the
street people of lower Sixth Avenue. It would rather conceive an
abstract errand than challenge us to do something _ borrow a
child's glance, perhaps _ or, worse, tell us we can't do much
besides drop a dollar. Dropping a dollar is easier than looking.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Duneier has spent seven years looking, and to such
effect that ``Sidewalk,'' like a pair of reading glasses, makes the
blur of what is close up turn sharp. Frequenting one particular
street colony, mainly black, in the blocks around the Avenue of the
Americas and Eighth Street, he finds a world of weakness and
failure but also one of mutual support, frail dignity, ingenious
struggle and fluid hierarchies.
</P>
<P>
   Used-book and magazine sellers rank at the top, their wares
displayed on rickety tables and trundled away at night to a storage
locker or accommodating garage. Then come Dumpster scavengers,
ranking in the middle; and then down to a range of ancillary
service providers: part-time table-minders and all-night
place-holders for the limited places available. At the bottom are
the drifting panhandlers and, before a police crackdown, the
self-appointed greeters and doormen at ATMs. ``Until 1996 the local
bank had four doormen who divided among them a 24-hour shift,''
Duneier wryly writes.
</P>
<P>
   That he can be wry and in some instances condemnatory only makes
more striking the sympathetic understanding that runs through his
magnificent book, with luminous photographs by Ovie Carter, whose
camera eye, held steady, records the humanity that ours avoids.
Contrary to a periscope, ``Sidewalk'' refracts our vision downward,
breaking through to what, for freshness, seems unnervingly like
open sky underneath our feet.
</P>
<P>
   Duneier is a professor of sociology, but he has a superb
journalist's ear for quotes and the ability to limn character and
scene. He writes, that is, as very few sociologists do; he stays on
for years, immersed in his subjects, as virtually no journalist
will do.
</P>
<P>
   Year after year he visited his street people, interviewing,
taping their exchanges with passersby and customers, and eventually
having them tape one another. He minded tables, made sales,
accompanied them on scavenging errands. It was not so much that he
won their trust as that they got used to living with him around. On
the street you have to live your life with all manner of things you
may not trust.
</P>
<P>
   His way in was the bookseller Hakim, a self-made
African-American intellectual who left a job as a legal and
financial proofreader to set up his tables on the street and
become, eventually, the wise man of the driftwood community. He had
felt humiliated and confined, racially and mentally, by the
corporate world where he held a small but comfortable place. ``I
needed my longitude and latitude,'' he told Duneier.
</P>
<P>
   It took a number of conversations before Hakim would open up,
wary as he was of being patronized and exploited by a white
scholar, yet bursting to share his reflections on a level not
possible with his street fellows. Eventually he became a lucid and
thoughtful Virgil to Duneier's Dante.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, that is. A measure of the author's passion and the
richness of his work is that after writing a book based on what
Hakim showed him, he put it aside. He remained on the street
another four or five years for a more difficult task: getting down
the stories and daily lives of some 20 people, many half crippled
by drugs, drink, hardship and jail, but driven by a will to
survive. They were not nearly as fluent as Hakim, yet Duneier
stayed to bring up deep-buried veins of wit, humor and
reflectiveness. It is as if Dante had told Virgil, ``Thanks for
your help with the residents; now I will stay on for face time.''
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, as if to hold the franchise, are passages that
wrap Duneier's provocative ideas in a caul of academic reiteration,
making explicit what is already so wonderfully implicit in the
street scenes, the encounters, the flow of life and talk the author
records. ``Sidewalk'' is far more than sociology, although it is
that, too; it is the chronicle of a community, a ``Nanook'' of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   There is Angela, whose bookstand is not far from that of Hakim,
who was for a number of years her lover and counselor. (When a
bookstore owner swoops down and confiscates four copies of a book
she insists were stolen, Hakim quiets Angela's outrage: ``When a
white woman comes here and says something is hers, it's hers.''
There is a world of borne injustice there; and Duneier sharpens it
with an account of the gray market in books conducted in at least
one respectable bookstore.)
</P>
<P>
   There are, among a dozen others, Marvin, the self-styled
``overseer'' of the used-magazine vendors (he discourages
pornography); Ron, his unsteady but redoubtable protege, and
Mudrick, man of picaresque words and schemes. There is the
precarious Butteroll, who sleeps in a niche beside the subway
tracks. ``The trains come about two feet from you,'' he relates.
``But you put your body in a position like listening to music. You
tune yourself to the roar of the tracks and the making of the noise
and you go right to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Duneier recounts the origins, travails, fragility of the street
community, with periodic police crackdowns under the
``broken-window'' theory of criminology: removing street disorder
and dilapidation reduces crime. (Bible: The poor are always with
you. Mayor: Not with me they're not.) He spells out the antisocial
aspects of the street people, but his book is a vivid, patient and
moving account of those who have inched up from crime and despair
to take control, however precarious and scruffy, of their lives.
From behind the broken windows, human eyes peer out.

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T CHALLENGED OVER INTERNET CONTROL
 &HT;    550&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal regulators should act to give a wide range
of Internet service providers access to AT&AMP;T Corp.'s high-speed
cable networks, consumer advocates and academic experts said at a
forum Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet providers nationwide want access to AT&AMP;T's
``broadband'' network in order to sell blazingly fast service that
would allow Internet users to use video and other cutting-edge
applications. The Federal Communications Commission, citing the
emergence of competitive broadband technologies, has refused to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is in a position to decide what kind of applications run
on the Internet,'' Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law School professor
who specializes in computer issues, said at a forum on the future
on the Internet in the coming era of high-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig said the company seeks to undermine the open,
decentralized and competitive nature of the Internet, which fosters
innovation because anyone can use it and anyone can communicate
with anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   He said the central ``end-to-end'' design principle of the
Internet requires that the ``intelligence'' be located where users
put data onto the network and take it out _ at its ``ends'' _ and
that the ``pipes'' through which the information flows be as simple
and neutral as possible.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, Lessig argued, wants to tie those pipelines to the content
and services they are selling and thereby control interconnection
to the world at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Architecture matters,'' Lessig said.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig called upon FCC Chairman William Kennard to end his
hands-off policy.
</P>
<P>
   The independent agency, he said, should back local cable
regulators who are contesting AT&AMP;T policies in the courts in order
to ensure customers have a wide range of choices in the
fast-growing broadband market.
</P>
<P>
   The position taken by Lessig and consumer advocates at the forum
reflects the Clinton administration's policy, spelled out in a
57-page report Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers should have choice in both their content and their
Internet access provider,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T General Counsel James Cicconi rejected ``the faulty notion
that AT&AMP;T has a monopoly on cable modem access'' to the Internet.
He cited a Dec. 6 accord with Atlanta-based Mindspring Enterprises
Inc., a large Internet service provider, to offer high-speed access
over AT&AMP;T's cable lines after AT&AMP;T's current exclusive contract
with Excite(at)Home expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Chairman Michael Armstrong has told Kennard that the
company has ``begun discussions with a number of (service providers
and Internet portals) about offering their services on our fixed
wireless and cable systems, and were open to discussions with
others as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Another seminar speaker, Mark Cooper, research director of the
Consumer Federation of America, said Armstrong would be
``conducting private negotiations'' in Aspen, Colo., over the
Christmas holidays with Steve Case, chairman of America OnLine
Inc., which has 20 million Internet subscribers in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the right way to make public policy,'' Cooper
claimed. Jim McCann, an AT&AMP;T spokesman, declined to confirm that
such talks would take place.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the current debate revolves less over freely
displaying any and all content and more over such commercial issues
as which content will be featured and which data, if any, will get
preferred treatment through AT&AMP;T's fast ``pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cicconi cited legal and technical issues that he
said could oblige AT&AMP;T to act as more than a neutral mail carrier
in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the company's obligation to preserve copyright
protection, a particularly sensitive issue in the music field at a
time when it has become simple for computers to make perfect
digital copies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another unresolved issue: How to deal with ``bandwidth
hogs'' _ customers who, say, seek to download a movie at a time
when their neighbors are also on line, thereby slowing down their
speed of Internet access.

PRIMORDIAL BEASTS, CREATIONISTS AND THE MIGHTY YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a sunny afternoon in SoHo and the
paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould _ president of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, the Vincent Astor
visiting research professor of biology at New York University and
the Alexander Agassiz professor of geology at Harvard _ was sitting
around his loft, ruminating about the pleasures of finally living
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Gould, 58, has spent much of his life circling Manhattan. He
grew up in 1950s Queens in a working-class family, in a time when
Manhattan was the ever-distant ``city.'' In 1967, Gould got his
Harvard appointment, which meant, of course, living in Cambridge
and being one of the few Yankees fans in all of Harvard Yard.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Gould, who was divorced, married a sculptor and
art historian, Rhonda Roland Shearer of Manhattan, now 45, and
together, they set up housekeeping in SoHo, in a vast urban spread
filled with Tiffany lamps, good art and first-edition scientific
tomes.
</P>
<P>
   In his 19 books and in essays for Natural History magazine,
Gould has become perhaps the most eloquent and best-known proponent
of the view that evolution and natural selection are responsible
for the origin and diversity of species. But earlier this month he
came under criticism in The New Yorker, which suggested that his
emphasis on chance in the evolutionary process had unwittingly
aided the cause of creationism.
</P>
<P>
   Gould declined to respond to the New Yorker article, by the
journalist Robert Wright, saying that he ``did not believe that
such personal attacks merited a response and that his work spoke
for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard paleontologist did, however, speak about other
aspects of the ongoing political struggle between creationists and
evolutionists.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was your reaction, when you first read that the Kansas
Board of Education was going to make the teaching of evolution
optional in biology classes?
</P>
<P>
   A. That the citizens of Kansas would be profoundly embarrassed
by the stupidity of the ruling and that they would vote that school
board out of office the next year. The Kansas School Board's
decision is absurd on the face of it. It's like saying, ``We're
going to continue to teach English, but you don't have to teach
grammar anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But the creationists can't do what they want to do because of
the history of Supreme Court decisions. They are very restricted in
terms of a legally defendable stand. This is probably the only
thing they can do.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason it happened is that nobody votes in school board
elections anymore. Thus, determined minorities can take over. It
took this fundamentalist group three election cycles to take over
in Kansas. They only have a one-vote majority, 6-4. Four are up for
election next year.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger dangers aren't these legal maneuvers. It's the
thousands of teachers who are less than optimally courageous, as
most humans are, who are probably teaching less evolution because
they don't want trouble. You can't even measure that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is creationism a uniquely American phenomenon?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's not hard to see. It just doesn't happen any place else
in the Western world. Europeans just don't get why we have it.
There are two things that European intellectuals don't understand
about Americans, I find. One was Bill and Monica, or, our obsession
with it. The second is how you can possibly have an anti-evolution
movement in a modern scientific country.
</P>
<P>
   Q. There is a recent trend in the social sciences to go to
neo-Darwinist explanations of social problems: a kind of mutant
resurgence of the Social Darwinism of the late 19th century. Why
has this happened now?
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a conservative age and I think, it's tempting for
conservatives to argue, ``Why are you calling for change or
equalization when what we have now reflects the natural state of
human nature?''
</P>
<P>
   Also, I think, we sometimes make a misuse today of Darwin in
terms of trying to assuage our disappointments with some of our
worst traits. That is, if we don't like our aggressivity or our
sexism, we might try to fob it off with: ``Oh, well, we're made
that way. We can't help it.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about the appeal of neo-Darwinism to people who like
their traits? The biological explanation ``it's a gene'' has, for
instance, become very popular with gay rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh yeah. This is an age that largely, wrongly, favors genetic
explanations. So it's going to spread everywhere. But I think
that's a two-headed argument. Because if you put your eggs in that
basket, then suppose it turns out that you're wrong? You don't want
to base a defense for a defendable bit of our diversity upon its
putative biological nature.
</P>
<P>
   I'd rather take the point of view that it has nothing to do with
the biology. It's an ethical issue.
</P>
<P>
   Q. As someone who publishes in both scientific and popular
media, what's your take on the quality of academic writing?
</P>
<P>
   A. Compared to what? I don't think academic writing ever was
wonderful. However, science used to be much less specialized. There
wasn't much technical terminology, and then, most academics are not
trained in writing. And there is what is probably worse than ever
before, the growing use of professional jargon.
</P>
<P>
   And I think it arises more out of fear than arrogance. Most
young scholars slip into this jargon because they are afraid that,
if they don't, their mentors or the people who promote them won't
think they are serious. I can't believe that anyone would WANT to
write that way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think your colleagues sometimes resent you because you
have, horror of all horrors, penned a few best sellers?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, sure. Anyone who has success in writing for the general
public is envied. Goethe died in 1832. As you know, Goethe was very
active in science. In fact, he did some very good scientific work
in plant morphology and mineralogy. But he was quite bitter at the
way in which many scientists refused to grant him a hearing because
he was a poet and therefore, they felt, he couldn't be serious.
This is not entirely a new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you write easily?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know what writer's block is.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does writing do for you?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's the best way to organize thoughts and to try and put
things in as perfect and as elegant a way you can. A lot of
scientists hate writing. Most scientists love being in the lab and
doing the work and when the work is done, they are finished.
Writing is a chore. It's something they have to do to get the work
out. They do it with resentment. But conceptually to them, it is
not part of the creative process. I don't look at it that way at
all. When I get the results, I can't wait to write them up. That's
the synthesis. It's the exploration of the consequences and the
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Since your marriage to Rhonda Roland Shearer, you have been
living half the time in New York and half in Cambridge. To what
extent has this new life left you feeling split?
</P>
<P>
   A. The big frustration is waiting for this decent train service
between Boston and New York to start. But I like living in New
York, though I don't feel that I ever left. I grew up in Fresh
Meadows, went to Jamaica High School.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You didn't go to Bronx High School of Science?
</P>
<P>
   A. It was too far. I got on a bus and subway and it took me two
hours to get there, and I thought, ``I'm not going to spend four
hours a day for the next three years on the subway.'' So I went to
Jamaica High School. You know, New York had a great public school
system once and it will again, I trust. I feel I got a great
education at Jamaica High. And P.S. 26 before that. I'm nothing but
an old city kid at heart.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your recent book, ``Questioning the Millennium,'' was, among
other things, a lengthy investigation of Year 2000 issues. Tell us,
are you and Rhonda secreting bottles of water and cords of firewood
for fear of what will happen when the clocks change?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, there's been a lot of attention to Y2K and a lot of
testing. I don't expect any. As a matter of fact, I will be singing
in a concert of Haydn's ``Creation'' in Boston on New Year's Day.
I'm going to have to get from here to there for rehearsal. I will
drive up there, though.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think anything significant is going to happen. In so far
that there are some worries on a global scale, the things I would
worry about are places that are really cold, like northern Russia,
where there could be an interruption of the electricity and heating
and things like that.
</P>
<P>
   The funniest thing you can say about it all is that in the year
1000, insofar as people were aware of the millennium, their fears
were grander. They feared the apocalyptic revelations of
Revelations. They really thought that Jesus would come again, that
Satan would be bound and the world, as we know it, would end.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's so amusing that in a secular age the main fear that
people have is caused by a technical glitch caused by a computer
misreading a date because of poor anticipation by some programmers
30 years ago.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A voluminous shield of precipitation will spread northeast
across the Southeast and Middle Atlantic states on Tuesday as a
low-pressure system, which spawned moderate to heavy rains Monday
across parts of the western Gulf states, ripples along a front. The
low will weaken and accelerate, however, reducing the risk of heavy
rain in many areas in the Southeast and Middle Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow swath of snow or ice, the latter mainly in the form of
freezing rain, will develop on the western fringe of the
precipitation shield across the lower Mississippi and Tennessee
Valleys as moist Gulf air glides over cold air wedging
south-southwestward in concert with a cold high-pressure system
over Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The swath of wintry precipitation will streak northeast across
parts of the Ohio Valley and then expand once it reaches the
central Appalachians in West Virginia and Pennsylvania later
Tuesday and Tuesday night. Some wintry precipitation may spread
east of the central Appalachians Tuesday night toward the northern
Middle Atlantic seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   An arctic front will slice across the Great Lakes on Tuesday. In
its wake, snow squalls and snow showers will stream off the
southern coast of Lake Superior and the eastern coast of Lake
Michigan, with some squalls producing snowfall rates of two inches
an hour or more.
</P>
<P>
   Winds from the east-northeast will average 20 to 30 mph hour,
with gusts over 40 mph, below canyons in parts of central and
southern California. Meanwhile, fog will shroud parts of the
Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Winter Begins
</P>
<P>
   At 2:44 a.m. EST on Wednesday, the sun's rays will be directly
overhead along the northeastern coast of Australia, marking the
winter solstice. The solstice is also the shortest day of the year
in the Northern Hemisphere. New York City will only receive nine
hours and 15 minutes of daylight. North of the Arctic Circle, the
sun will not rise at all. The long night will reach its midpoint at
the North Pole on Wednesday and, while the days begin slowly to
lengthen in this hemisphere, the cold air will continue to
strengthen for several weeks in the feeble sunlight of the northern
latitudes.

`BOMB-ITTY OF ERRORS:' RAP IS TO SHAKESPEARE AS BOMB IS TO COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The farcically disastrous performance of ``Taming of
the Shrew'' that is at the center of ``Kiss Me, Kate'' on Broadway
doesn't do half the damage to Shakespeare that is cheerfully
executed, in a garage-like space in the East Village, by the four
young creators of ``The Bomb-itty of Errors.'' Shakespeare can take
it; theatergoers who don't also appreciate a mosh pit may have a
harder time.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to dismiss, just advise. The show, an adaptation of
the slapstick mistaken-identity play that is arguably Shakespeare's
silliest work, all in rap verse and sketch-comedy staging, has the
kind of relentless exuberance, exhortatory fervor and enthusiasm
for all manner of sex acts that remind older people that youth is
wasted on the young. The full-house audience at the recent
performance I attended, evidently including a large contingent from
nearby New York University, was noisily responsive with delight,
and it wasn't because they could follow the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Those without Shakespearean background enough to know that the
source material is ``The Comedy of Errors'' can still enjoy this;
indeed they might be the ideal audience. Shakespeare's play _ which
concerns twin sets of twins, separated at birth, and their
accidental, convoluted reconciliation _ makes it tough enough to
follow the plot machinations, much less swallow them. Here the
story matters almost not at all.
</P>
<P>
   The action is set in a contemporary Manhattan-like place, and
the two sets of twins (in Shakespeare, two masters and their
servants) are here all four brothers born to the same parents, a
rap star and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   How they came to be separated has to do with the rapper being
arrested for selling drugs, an episode recounted in a prologue that
introduces the four performers and their hip-hop take on
Shakespearean verse:
</P>
<P>
   He started sellin' skunk, you know, cheeba? Weed?
</P>
<P>
   Just to try and get by and give his family what they need.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's not iambic pentameter, which is, of course, the point:
the poetry of Shakespeare made modern (and not entirely
grammatical). There is an admirable zest in the persistent doggerel
in which the entire 90-minute text of the play is delivered. The
ambition of it, the gall, really, and the intermittent achievement
of genuine cleverness are the show's chief pleasures. The problem
is these guys aren't quite Shakespeare's equal when it comes to
wordplay (oh well), and though it's hard not to admire the number
of rhymes they come up with for the male sex organ _ Venus,
limousine is, Salinas, arenas, to name just a few _ there are
limited theatrical pleasures to be derived from this.
</P>
<P>
   The show would be hugely improved with more attention to
performance fundamentals. No one, including the director, Andy
Goldberg, seems to have thought of doing any real choreographing
aside from keeping the actors from bumping into each other while
horsing around. Perhaps that's because the performers, all of whom
play multiple roles and all of whom have taken hip-hop stage names
_ Rodan (Jordan Allen-Dutton), Gruff (Jason Catalano), G.Q.
(Gregory J. Qaiyum) and Red Dragon (Erik Weiner) _ don't seem to
dance particularly well in spite of their obvious athleticism.
Catalano (or would that be Gruff?) does nice bits as a hooker in a
platinum wig and a leopard-patterned satin teddy and as a
Rastafarian herb seller.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, as actors there is little to judge them by. Weiner is
particularly annoying as Luciana, the dim-witted husband-seeker of
the two Shakespearean sisters, not bothering to hide his goatee
(yuk yuk) and reciting all his lines in a falsetto.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a generation gap at work here. The audience
seemed not to share any of my reservations and left the theater as
jazzed as any group of theatergoers I've seen in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   So, as I understand the phrase, word up.

`DON'T DISCRIMINATE' IS BETTER THAN `DON'T ASK'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK Z. SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, a newspaper cartoonist outlined a proposed
compromise on the issue of whether gays and lesbians should be
allowed to serve in the military.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoonist's solution? Homosexuals could serve on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   That tongue-in-cheek proposal was good for a laugh. But it makes
about as much sense as the U.S. military's current ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   The policy should be scrapped. It's a simple matter of fairness.
Gay soldiers should be allowed to serve in the military under the
same rules of conduct that govern heterosexuals. It's way past time
for discrimination to end.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered a 90-day
review of the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy after President
Clinton complained that it was not working as intended. Clinton
cited the murder of a gay Army private as an example.
</P>
<P>
   Pfc. Barry Winchell was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat
in July as he slept in his barracks at Fort Campbell, Ky., after
enduring months of cruel harassment supposedly forbidden by the
policy. Another private, Calvin Glover, recently was sentenced to
life in prison for the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask, don't tell'' forbids the military from inquiring
about a soldier's sex life unless there is clear evidence of
homosexual conduct. But the policy also requires soldiers to leave
the service if they volunteer that they are homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pentagon, 1,145 people were discharged last
year for being gay. The majority of the discharges were due to
statements that violated the ``don't tell'' policy, rather than for
homosexual conduct. Although the policy was supposed to help
prevent discrimination against gays, last year's discharge total
far exceeded the 682 discharges of gays in 1993, the year the
policy took effect.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Clinton, as well as Democratic presidential
candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley, has urged that the policy be
ended and that gays serve in the military under the same terms as
heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Commendably, Bradley has gone a major step further, urging that
discrimination against gays be barred under the historic Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The law forbids discrimination based on a person's race,
religion or gender. Discrimination is forbidden in employment,
housing, lending and public accommodations. Under Bradley's
proposal, the act would be expanded to ban discrimination based on
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``don't ask, don't tell'' is being increasingly
recognized for the abysmal failure that it is.
</P>
<P>
   Large U.S. newspapers editorializing in favor of ending the
policy include Newsday, The New York Times, the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, the San Francisco Chronicle and The Arizona
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   As the Post-Dispatch put it: ``It is time for Mr. Clinton and
the military to dispense with `don't ask.' The best policy is the
one Americans claim to hold so dear _ don't discriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle said: ``As anecdote after anecdote shows, many
homosexual men and women are valiantly serving their country, often
in extraordinarily heroic ways. They should be subject to the same
rules and restrictions as all members of the armed services, no
more and no less ... they should not be penalized with a
hypocritical policy that says they may only fight for their country
if they live a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republic cited the case of gay Army Reservist Steve May, a
Republican state legislator in Arizona who was characterized as
``one of the finest young officers'' in an Army performance review.
May now faces discharge because he revealed that he is gay in
commenting on an anti-gay bill in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should pass whatever legislation might be needed to bar
discrimination against gays in the military. Such action would echo
a long-occurring trend across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Britain announced this past week that it has decided to end its
ban on homosexuals in the armed forces. But Britain is a laggard.
Most other European nations have allowed gays in the military for
years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ending ``don't ask, don't tell,'' the U.S.
military should conduct markedly stronger training programs to
encourage more tolerance toward homosexuals and actively discourage
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't take the violent death of a young Army private in
Kentucky to galvanize the nation into ending discrimination against
gays in the military. What's right is right, and discrimination is
clearly wrong.

   RUSSIA-POLITICS-ANALYSIS _ MOSCOW _ A senior Kremlin official
called Sunday's parliamentary election results a ``peaceful
revolution'' that offers new hope for Russia's long-stalled market
and democratic reforms. But nothing is a sure thing given Russia's
complex political system, the ongoing war in Chechnya and the

 &HT;    Read of the week: Healthy cookbooks
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie and M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for a gift book for someone who needs to change their
diet, or recipes for a healthier new year for your family? Three of
these are published by major national health organizations and the
fourth by Atlanta's Promina Health System.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``American Medical Association Family Health Cookbook'' by
Melanie Barnard and Brooke Dojny with Mindy Hermann,
</P>
<P>
   registered dietitian, and C. Wayne Callaway, M.D. (Pocket Pooks,
1997, $16 paperback, $30 hardback)
</P>
<P>
   Not just a cookbook, this begins with textbook-like information
about ``good food that's good for you.'' The diet-health connection
is covered in regard to heart disease, cancer, diabetes and
maintenance of a healthy weight. The book also gives a crash course
on nutrition basics, food labels and vitamins and sorts through the
confusing maze of fats and cholesterol. Foods to always have on
hand are described, along with how to keep your kitchen and food
free from contamination. The book is full of variety: penne pasta
with sausage and autumn vegetables; grilled salmon with dilled
cucumber yogurt sauce; baked potatoes with spicy chili bean
topping. There are helpful hints peppered throughout, such as how
to properly crush a garlic clove. A very healthful and helpful
512-page book, with 350 recipes listing per-serving calories and
nutritional information.

   Porcupine meatballs. Breakfast pizzas. Berries in rich vanilla
cream. Sound heart-healthy to you? They are, along with some 400
other dishes put together by the nation's top organization devoted
to preventing heart disease and strokes. Lowering or keeping
cholesterol levels low is the goal of these recipes, along with
proving that it's possible to eat both ``healthful and zestful''
food. Dishes are simple, and the book includes an appendix of which
recipes to combine for a complete meal or party appetizers. The new
edition of the book has 698 pages and 150 new recipes, which list
per-serving calories and other nutritional information.

</P>
<P>
   You don't have to have diabetes to find this cookbook helpful in
planning low-fat, delicious meals. And those living with diabetes
can learn how to make easy-to-prepare dishes that don't require
special ingredients or extra time or fuss in the kitchen. Recipes,
ranging from moussaka with lamb to avocado-and-grapefruit salad
with sherry vinaigrette to Georgia peach cooler, use lower-fat
ingredients whenever possible or unsaturated fats (olive or canola
oils) when needed. Sugar, not sugar substitutes, is used, because
people with diabetes can eat small amounts of sugar as long as
their overall daily carbohydrate intake does not exceed recommended

   INTERNET SITE OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   You know why your doctor prescribed the drug. You know what's on
the list of warnings the pharmacist gave you. But reactions to
drugs can differ by individual. What can you actually expect when
you start taking it?
</P>
<P>
   No one can guarantee how you'll react to a drug, but the
Internet Drug Index (www.rxlist.com/) can help. Among the features
of this longstanding site is RxBoard, a set of bulletin boards
where people trade descriptions of their experiences with the 20
drugs most frequently prescribed in the United States, as well as
some alternative medications. Among the entries: arguments over
whether Prozac causes weight gain, testimonials to the new
painkiller Celebrex, and a report of fever and headache after
taking ginkgo biloba.
</P>
<P>
   The site was created as a public service by a pharmacist named
Neil Sandow. Recently it began being hosted by HealthCentral, a
medical-themed Internet portal that, like many medical gateways
these days, includes a link to an online pharmacy. As with all
sites on the Net, exercise caution and judgment.

 &HT;    Futurists foretell of life in the next century
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newsweek ($3.95) bids farewell to Charlie Brown and the
``Peanuts'' crowd in a cover story this week, but the most
compelling reading is the magazine's predictions for the 21st
century. According to the experts Newsweek consulted, the brave new
world will feature toys designed by kids, dolls that will act as
baby monitors and automobiles that drive us instead of vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   In science, neuroplasticity will influence the way we use our
brains, better sex may be just a bodysuit and virtual-reality booth
away and 90 percent of all books will be published electronically
by 2020. In the entertainment world, TV shows and movies will be
viewed on demand.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to illustrate just how wrong the seers can be, John
Leland writes about what the experts foresaw for America in 1899.
Most futurists missed the medical advances of the 20th century and
only one mentioned the automobile, or ``electrical carriage.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Amazon man: By now you probably know that Amazon.com founder
Jeff Bezos has been named Time's ($3.95) Person of the Year. But
the magazine also devotes a sizable chunk of this issue to others
who mattered in 1999 as well as providing an analysis of the impact
the Internet has had on society. One major trend is the explosion
of collectibles _ from yesteryear's treasures to yesterday's
garbage _ for sale or auction on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   As for other notables, Time's gallery includes Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
golfer Tiger Woods, Jordan's Queen Noor and ``Harry Potter'' author
J.K. Rowling.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Familiar face: U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($3.95) hedges its
bets by naming Uncle Sam as Person of the Century. In a look back
at the past 100 years, reporter Michael Barone explains how America
has left its mark on the world with everything from movies to
microchips. Included is an interesting lineup of 25 entrepreneurs,
entertainers and visionaries who shaped the modern era, from
shopping mall inventor Victor Gruen to the Big Mac himself, Ray
Kroc.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  People who made a difference: Looking at history in a
different light, American Heritage ($4.95) doesn't even include
Bezos on its list of the century's 20 greatest innovators. The top
10 are television inventor Philo T. Farnsworth, botanist George
Washington Carver, polio vaccine developer Jonas Salk, automotive
pioneer Henry Ford, aviation pioneers the Wright brothers,
physicist Albert Einstein, laser progenitor Charles Townes and
electrical engineer Charles Steinmetz.
</P>
<P>
   And in an article bound to stir debate, Victor Davis Hanson
argues that instead of being a ruthless act of revenge, Gen.
William T. Sherman's march through Georgia actually was ``a vast
moral crusade'' that saved lives on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Literature of the millennium: Some of the best writing in The
New Yorker's ($3) Millennial Fiction issue is not fiction at all,
but rather letters written by soldiers in the American wars of the
century. ``Sure, I was afraid _ as you or any other chap would be,
too,'' one World War I soldier writes from France, ``but what I
feared most was I would be yellow.'' By Vietnam, the tone of the
writing had changed. ``Every second I was expecting to die,'' one
man writes. ``I regretted everything I had done for the U.S.A. ...
Americans are ruthless and violent: I hate 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   The fictional contributions are excellent as well, with works by
Alice Munro, Robert Stone, Alec Wilkinson, Donald Antrim and James
Thurber.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Julia Roberts tells In Style ($3.95) that she has
finally found some stability on her 82-acre Southwestern ranch _
and in her relationships. The Georgia actress lives on the ranch
with six horses, seven dogs and former ``Law &AMP; Order'' actor
Benjamin Bratt. Roberts also makes the cover of People ($3.99) as
one of the 25 most intriguing people of '99. ... Jezebel ($3.95)
chats with former Atlanta resident and ``Melrose Place'' actress
Jamie Luner about her new role in the ``Profiler'' TV series. The
magazine also visits Jim Borum and Quinn Brack, who have moved into
one of Margaret Mitchell's old apartments at the corner of South
Prado and Piedmont Avenue.

AT 40, SECOND CITY HAS GROWN FROM A COMEDY CLUB TO AN EMPIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ ``I feel like I was born here,'' Alan Arkin said.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been in 1960, when Arkin, the comic actor and
director, was 28 and starving for work (and to hear him tell it,
food) in New York. Out of desperation and with a sense of descent
into oblivion, he accepted an invitation to move to Chicago and
join a fledgling comedy troupe called the Second City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the end of everything,'' he said. ``But it
was the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was. The troupe that began here in 1959 (the name
comes from a disparaging remark about Chicago by A.J. Liebling),
forging a new art form from the disparate skills of classical
acting and comic improvisation, celebrated its 40th anniversary
last weekend, having by now peopled the world of television
sitcoms, filled the nation's cabarets with stand-up and spawned
nutty movies by the dozen.
</P>
<P>
   It has grown to become a company, in the corporate sense of the
word, whose business is the creation and distribution of comedy. It
includes a troupe in Toronto that in the 1970s created the
television show ``SCTV.'' For the last 20 years a second Chicago
troupe, the Second City e.t.c., has performed in a separate theater
around the corner from the company's building on North Wells
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago a troupe was started in Detroit, and another is
to make its debut in Cleveland in the spring. Three touring groups
serve as a sort of farm team for the franchise, and there are
training centers in New York and Los Angeles as well as in Chicago,
the nation's center for improvisation-based comedy, which alone has
800 students. Second City has even built a corporate division that
sends actors out as business consultants, teaching levity as a
management tool.
</P>
<P>
   Its list of alumni is, of course, legendary, a multigenerational
Who's Who of funny: Mike Nichols, Elaine May, Joan Rivers, Edward
Asner, Valerie Harper, John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner,
Martin Short, Bill Murray, Andrea Martin, George Wendt, Shelley
Long, Dan Castellaneta, Amy Sedaris and Tim Meadows, to name a
handful.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin was among dozens of them _ including Joe Flaherty, Robert
Klein, Avery Schreiber and Harold Ramis _ who returned for the
40th-anniversary weekend, three days of performances by current
members and reminiscences about the rise of an institution _ ``My
God, it's an empire!'' Klein exclaimed at one point _ that by now
is probably to blame if there is too much comedy in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It was also an opportunity to reflect on the changes wrought on
comedy by the world, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were committed to mischief,'' said Bernard Sahlins, who
started the company with Paul Sills and Howard Alk at a time when
the one-liners of Bob Hope and Henny Youngman defined popular wit,
before personal revelation and political mockery became comic
staples, when the stage irreverence of Mort Sahl, Dick Gregory and
Lenny Bruce was new and shocking.
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``We had a golden opportunity. McCarthyism had
chilled everything, and comedy was a lot of mother-in-law jokes.
There wasn't any political humor. All you had to do was go out on
stage and say `Eisenhower,' and everybody had an orgasm. It just
wasn't done.''
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for the weekend's discussion was opening night of
the company's latest main-stage revue, its 85th. Like all of Second
City's core work, it was a series of sketches, some loosely
connected by overlapping characters, that were written by the six
performers and honed into polished routines with a director over
weeks of improvising sessions. Improvisations are built into the
program, but even they have a format, with specific places where a
suggestion for a song title, say, or a food, is solicited from the
audience to catalyze a comic riff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improvisation is not a presentational form,'' Sahlins said,
``except in small doses or as a game. It's a tool.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a working method that is distinct to Second City, and it
existed from the start, a melding of the ideas of Viola Spolin, a
theater teacher who created an influential set of games for actor
training; her son, Sills, a director; David Shepherd, the founder
of the Compass Players, a theater troupe based on the European
tradition of commedia dell'arte; and Sahlins, a classical theater
producer and director.
</P>
<P>
   It is full-time work: daytime rehearsals, evening performances
and late-night improv sessions. Intended to bring discipline to the
fervid cultural observations of young performers, the method tends
to instill professionalism in the eager anarchists who are drawn to
comic theater. This helps explain why Second City, with performers
and audiences that stay the same age (18 to 35), has endured
through four decades of flux in culture and comedy. Its guiding
principle, which was invoked frequently during the weekend: Always
perform at the top of your intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``At its best, it is a comedy of behavior, not a comedy of
comment,'' Sahlins said.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary show was exemplary. It began with a couple in a
doctor's office, getting bad news. The doctor has found a lump in
the woman's breast. Long, discomforting pause. Then the husband
speaks: ``But you're a dentist!''
</P>
<P>
   It was a characteristic moment: quick and rather spare,
resonantly topical, obviously, aggressively irreverent. The two
dozen or so other bits were similar. There was the folk singer
singing about how he picked up a homeless woman: ``I asked her, `My
place or mine?''' There the post-game interview with a football
star who thanks God for helping him score the winning touchdown:
``So why,'' the interviewer asks about his opponents, ``does God
hate the Kansas City Chiefs?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was well received by the visiting alumni _ ``How about that
dentist?'' Klein said _ interesting to them as much for what wasn't
on stage as for what was. There was sexual humor, but no vulgarity
for the sake of outrage, not a single cheap clutch of the genitals.
There were no references to the culture of television. Most
surprising, there was no overt political satire. Subtle subversion,
if that's possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed that,'' said Klein, who spent 14 months at Second
City in 1965 and 1966. ``We were nonstop political,'' he said.
``Our Mayor Daley, I did him all the time. I was also the local
Lyndon Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkin said he had not been back to Second City since the 25th
anniversary, when the sense of anything goes, a hangover from the
John Belushi ``Animal House'' days _ Sahlins called the influence
of Belushi on less gifted performers ``pernicious'' _ dragged the
company into a kind of comedy gutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago I felt it was anarchic and vulgar, and I was
dismayed,'' Arkin said. ``But this tonight was very impressive,
literary in a way. There was a slight cynicism to it, I thought,
but that's just appropriate to the time. For us there was an
innocence to what we were doing. We thought we were going to change
the world. And there was no touching. Whatever sexuality we put
onstage was very timid.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 Sahlins sold Second City to Andrew Alexander, who had
been running the Toronto troupe and who has presided over the
expansion, enlarging the training programs, opening the Detroit
branch and, in 1992, beginning the corporate division, which, given
the irreverent nature of the Second City product, was viewed by
some in the company with some skepticism. But it has served the
company well financially, bringing in $1.5 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was resistance in the very beginning,'' Alexander said.
``The attitude toward the corporate world was, `Isn't that selling
out?' It's still a balancing act. But it's become an important part
of our expansion. We have limited space for live shows. You can
only sell 350 seats so many times a week.''
</P>
<P>
   And for many of the young performers who are drawn to Second
City as a launching pad to television, Alexander said, the
corporate workshops are good practice for money-making gigs to
come. ``They're viewed now as live commercials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's current projects include developing the means for
live Webcasting and diversifying its audience, which remains almost
entirely white. The Detroit troupe has introduced a handful of
black performers into the Second City pipeline; two of the e.t.c.
cast members are black, and one is Hispanic. But the company
acknowledges that it has been frustrated in its attempts to draw a
more racially mixed crowd. It has applied for city funds to build a
new theater on Chicago's largely black South Side, where the wish
is to attract a black business partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very community-based tradition,'' said Kelly Leonard,
the producer of Second City in Chicago. ``We speak a common
language, and it's a white language. For a young, funny black
person, going the stand-up route has been the route to success.
We've been cracking away at this for six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point we did three minority-based shows. They were
mostly well reviewed. But the audiences were mostly white. And
we've been going into a lot of black high schools, and they've
loved what we do. But that hasn't translated to more black students
in the training center. We've done better with women. Until a few
years ago the typical Second City cast was four men and two women.
Now most of them are three and three.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the changes, the talk over the weekend was mostly about
what has stayed the same. Older alumni and younger ones shared
reminiscences about their training, recalling stern taskmasters
Paul Sills, a noted curmudgeon (now a theater teacher and director
in Door County, Wis.) and Del Close.
</P>
<P>
   Close, who died last year, was a legendary influence on
generations of Second City performers, insisting on selflessness
onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be cute in your work,'' Tina Fey, a 1990s alumna and now
a writer for ``Saturday Night Live,'' said, summarizing Close's
advice. ``He asked me, `What's this scene about?' And I said
something. He said, `This scene is about bad improv.'''
</P>
<P>
   Arkin, who is preparing to direct ``Taller Than a Dwarf,'' a new
play by Elaine May, on Broadway, said he relished Second City
particularly for what it has never yielded to the changing times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only place in the country where you're allowed to
fail,'' he said. ``You're encouraged to fail, because that's how
you learn. Failure has become a moral issue in this country. You
fail at anything, you're a bad person. It's a disaster.''

 &HT;    NASCAR president France has cancer
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bill France Jr., who brought NASCAR into the national
limelight, faces a new challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The organization announced Monday that France, NASCAR's
president, has been diagnosed with cancer. Officials said France is
pursuing additional diagnosis and treatments but did not offer
details or identify the type of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors have told me that the illness is treatable,''
France said in a statement. ``I am anxious to begin treatment and
get on the road to recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is in good spirits,'' said France's son, Brian, who
serves as NASCAR's vice president. ``He is receiving expert medical
care, and we have the utmost respect and confidence in his medical
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The news about France surprised the stock-car-racing circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry to hear it,'' said Tom Beard, co-owner of the No.
36 Winston Cup team. ``I hope he treats it as aggressively as he
treats the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Motor Speedway general manager and president Ed Clark
was informed of the situation late Sunday night after getting a
call from NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a shock, and terrible timing by happening here
at Christmas,'' Clark said. ``We're going to put Bill France on our
prayer list and support him all we can. We hope he gets through
these treatments and whatever they else they can do, make a full
recovery and be active as long as he wants to be for a long, long
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill France is so important to so many people in this
business,'' Clark said. ``I'm sure he will fight this with the same
intensity he did to bring NASCAR to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Felix Sabates, who owns the race teams of Sterling Marlin and
Kenny Irwin, said he talked to France on the telephone Sunday.
Sabates said France's health concerns were brought up during the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bill) really didn't make that big of deal out of it,''
Sabates said. ``I had called him to talk about some issues with my
race teams. He just said he had undergone some treatments but
didn't go through a whole lot of details. But he didn't sound too
worried about it to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the doctors have said the illness is treatable, then I'm
sure he will recover. Bill is a fighter. He'll make it.''
</P>
<P>
   France, 66, owns NASCAR and International Speedway Corporation.
Last February, he turned over the day-to-day operation to Mike
Helton.

&HT;     STUDYING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A DUCK CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ We peered over the top of the duck blind,
largely concealed by eucalyptus branches spread across its top, and
watched Moto Duck do its thing.
</P>
<P>
   A low fog hung over the marsh. My partner, Bob Simms, and I were
dressed in camouflage, calling for mallards, sprig and wigeon. Moto
Duck, meanwhile, about 40 feet in front of the blind, set well
ahead of a spread of duck decoys, was near silent as it worked
away.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn, the fog seemed to break, we looked up and a flock of
seven spoonies came soaring in. We raised our shotguns, but
stopped, when right behind them came a flight of wigeon, then all
at once, a succession of mallards, sprig and buffleheads. For a few
minutes, the marsh came alive with so many ducks, at least 100,
that it was awe-inspiring for us to simply watch them fly over us.
</P>
<P>
   Did Moto Duck bring them in? Or was it the sudden break in the
fog? Simms' skilled calling? A light breeze that put a ripple on
the pond? Or the break of dawn when the entire world of nature
seems to come alive?
</P>
<P>
   On our right, a biologist from the University of California at
Davis, Josh Ackerman, was trying to determine the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest controversy in wildlife in California, and spreading
quickly to the rest of North America, right now is the use of Moto
Duck, which attracts ducks by simulating the sound of flapping
wings, on waterfowl hunts _ and whether or not it gives hunters an
unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   That is why UC-Davis is undertaking a study in which hunters are
being logged for 100 days this season by scientists acting as
independent observers. The study is being funded by hunters with
the California Waterfowl Association.
</P>
<P>
   Under the biologists' supervision, Moto Duck is run for 30
minutes, and all activity is logged. Then, Moto Duck is turned off
for 30 minutes, and again, all activity is again logged. After this
winter's season, the results will be compiled to determine if Moto
Duck has resulted in a higher duck kill.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has become intense among some hunters. They have been
banned through a private agreement by some private duck clubs, such
as Capitol and several neighboring clubs in the Colusa Basin in
California's Sacramento Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A Moto Duck does not look a duck. It looks instead like a
strange mechanical device that was invented by a rocket scientist,
and it is posted three feet above the water. The key to the device
is a revolving blade, one side painted light, one side painted
dark, which is turned by a motor at a precise speed to simulate the
wingbeats of a landing mallard. There are now thousands of them in
use in California, having increased in large numbers suddenly in
the past year, now with many hunters using three and four of them
around their blinds. They cost from $180 to $250 each.
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing we were outdoors writers, Simms and I were
contacted as independent testers. A hunt was arranged through
UC-Davis at the Pioneer Duck Club east of Williams, a top club that
offers the opportunity to hunt a four-person blind for $160 total
for a day; unlike most duck clubs, there is no seasonal membership
fee. At 6:20 a.m., we pulled in, met club owner Jeanne Cave and
biologist Ackerman. Moments later, we fired up the outboard motor
on a small boat, and cruised through the fog across a pond that
looked like a Scottish moor, and reached a well-hidden platform
blind in tules, which included a hiding place for the boat.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment started at 6:41 a.m., when Ackerman started the
Moto Duck, timed for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing we noticed was the distant squawks of geese,
nowhere in sight, flying above the layer of fog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to the geese,'' Simms said. ``There must be thousand of
them up there.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, three teal sailed by, emerging so fast out of
the fog that we didn't even have a chance to say anything. Ackerman
immediately logged them on his study sheet. In the next five
minutes there arrived mallards, sprig, a single canvasback, and
more teal _ shadowed by the distant squawks of geese.
</P>
<P>
   When the first 30 minutes was up, Ackerman turned off Moto Duck.
At the time, a heavy fog again dropped down on the marsh. We then
sat there looking at each other, telling stories and eating a
strange breakfast/lunch. At one point, Simms was admiring a ham
sandwich, when four mallards suddenly divebombed us and continued
past. Our hearts pounded as we hoped for them to return, and Simms
grabbed his duck call and proceed to fill it with the partially
chewed bite of his ham sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the magic, fun and comradeship of a duck hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The test last three hours, and at 9:47 a.m., Ackerman called it
quits. We took 10 ducks, eight when the Moto Duck was running, and
passed on dozens of others because they arrived so fast out of the
fog that we found ourselves surprised.
</P>
<P>
   To this point in the season in California, using Moto Ducks has
been more productive than without, by generally a 5-to-2 ratio,
according to a well-connected insider, though these numbers are
unofficial.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman took wing samples from each of the birds in order to
age and classify them, and then left to assess his data.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Simms and I headed back to the blind, looked up at
the sky, now clearing, and watched the skeins of hundreds of Snow
geese, thousands in all, passing high overhead.
</P>
<P>
   We crouched down, watching them and Simms asked, ``Have you seen
the rest of my sandwich?''

 &HT;    World Access deals again
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ World Access on Monday announced a tentative deal for
a $650 million acquisition _ the second major purchase within days
for the rapidly growing, Atlanta-based telecom company.
</P>
<P>
   With a series of mergers, World Access is becoming an
increasingly high-profile provider of long-distance, data and other
services, mostly in Europe. Its latest target is Star
Telecommunications Inc. in a stock deal that will give World Access
the California-based company and its international long-distance
business, most of which is in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will give World Access annual revenue of more than $2.3
billion and will ``accelerate our plans to be a leading provider of
bundled voice, data and Internet services in key international
markets,'' said John D. Phillips, chairman and chief executive
officer of World Access.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, World Access announced an agreement to buy the assets
of Florida-based Long Distance International for more than $185
million in stock. That deal will give World Access about 20,000
corporate customers in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   World Access last year had revenues of just $152 million, but
has been on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this fall, World Access agreed to buy FaciliCom
International, a provider of long-distance services in Europe, for
$750 million. At the time, Phillips promised to ratchet up the
company's growth through more acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   FaciliCom had invested several hundred million dollars in
networks in 14 countries. By combining assets _ and continuing to
buy other companies _ World Access can make increasingly efficient
use of its long-distance network.
</P>
<P>
   That approach can let World Access handle each dollar of Star's
business more profitably, said analyst Stephen Shook of Wachovia
Securities. ``You can take a company losing money and make it very
profitable _ which is what I think is happening in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's rapid growth raises its profile in Europe, where
deregulation and growth are roiling telecom markets. That profile
also makes World Access itself a potential takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is, that from this point on, they will be a very
attractive,'' Shook said. ``Maybe MCI WorldCom, maybe Global
Crossing _ anyone who plays in the international market might be
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom, based in Jackson, Miss. , is already a substantial
minority stockholder.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, World Access announced plans to spin off its
$250 million-a-year equipment group in order to let management
concentrate on its European telecom business.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's announcement, World Access stock was up 50 cents
a share to close at $20.875. Shares of Star jumped $2 to close at
$8.875.

<P>
   OHIO-VOUCHER-EDUC (Cleveland) _ A federal judge threw out the
state's taxpayer-funded school voucher program Monday, saying it
violated the constitutional separation of church and state.
(Summary from wires) By Jodi Wilgoren.
</P>
<P>
   VT-GAY-MARRIAGE (Boston) _ The Vermont Supreme Court ruled on
Monday that the state must guarantee the very same protections and
benefits to committed gay couples as it does to heterosexual
spouses. The decision stopped short of legalizing gay marriage but
threw open the legal door to it and left up to the legislature
whether Vermont will become the first state to take that step. By
Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   SC-REPUBS (Columbia, S.C.) _ Ever since Ronald Reagan's 1980
victory put South Carolina's primary on the map, it has had a
central place in Republican politics. Now, Sen. John McCain and
Gov. George W. Bush are campaigning as if South Carolina were
pivotal in their nomination fight. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   NY-SEX-SHOPS (Albany, N.Y.) _ The state's highest court ruled on
Monday that the Giuliani administration had overstepped its bounds
in trying to shut down adult businesses, a decision that could
affect dozens of stores, and is by far the Mayor's worst setback in
his drive to restrict X-rated bookstores and theaters. By Richard
Perez-Pena.
</P>
<P>
   INS-DEPORT (Rochester, N.Y.) _ The proposed deportation of an
Italian-born housewife and mother convicted of shoplifting, a woman
who has not lived in Italy since the age of five, is an example of
a common predicament that even sponsors of tough deportation laws
enacted by Congress in 1996 are now saying needs to be changed. By
Eric Lipton.
</P>
<P>
   EARNINGS-REPORTS (Undated) _ A penny is not worth much nowadays
except, oddly enough, on Wall Street. There, a penny a share in
company earnings can mean the difference between a stock that soars
and one that skids. The punishment that stocks regularly endure
from investors disappointed over the tiniest earnings misses has
put managements under pressure to deliver upbeat earnings
announcements even if the numbers do not support them. The result,
according to some Wall Street accounting experts, is a disturbing
trend. More and more companies, they say, are going to extremes to
paint a rosy picture of their operations _ so much so that the news
distributed by companies in news releases and conference calls with
analysts is increasingly suspect, they say. By Gretchen Morgenson.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ASSESS (Moscow) _ The West has long seen the development
of democracy in Russia as a check against the Kremlin's military
ambitions and a way to bridge the political divide between East and
West. But consider the results of Russia's Parliamentary election:
millions of Russians went to the polls and demonstrated their
support for the war in Chechnya by voting for candidates backed by
Vladimir Putin, Russia's hawkish prime minister. A news analysis by
Michael R. Gordon.

<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ I had a college professor who claimed sports
simply mirrors society at large. If so, the mirror in which we look
is cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Charlotte, former Carolina Panther Rae Carruth is
accused of first-degree murder, the first active NFL player so
charged.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, running back Cecil Collins was arrested for burglary
after he broke into a couple's apartment. He had reportedly been
annoying the woman for two months before his 5 a.m. break-in on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the heart of Jerry Jones' Texas, the Cowboys have as
their starting defensive tackles Alonzo Spellman, who has a history
of mental problems, and Leon Lett, who has had several suspensions
for drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Former Ram Darryl Henley is in prison for drug trafficking and
threatening to kill a judge.
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants quarterback Kerry Collins nearly had his career
derailed by alcohol abuse before seeking treatment. Same thing with
teammate Christian Peter, who had incidents of violence against
women while at Nebraska That were fueled by alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco 49ers finally wised up and got rid of their
social blight from Nebraska, Lawrence Phillips, before he could do
more damage than insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   These are only some of the more recent abuses perpetuated by NFL
players. While these problems certainly exist in the larger
society, they are magnified when they occur in the over-hyped world
of sports. Furthermore, athletes seem to think they are immune from
the consequences of their actions. Sometimes they are. Money often
buys justice in our skewed society.
</P>
<P>
   While the Carruth case is truly tragic for the number of people
it affects, most of the offenses involving athletes are rather
tiresome and cliche, reflecting a class of young men who have a lot
of money and think they can get away with anything.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, NFL rosters generally have many more good guys than
bad guys. It's certainly newsworthy when an NFL player is accused
of a crime, but on a daily basis it's a pleasure dealing with the
league's solid citizens. On the 49ers that means guys like Bryant
Young, Junior Bryant, Tim McDonald, Steve Young and all the
offensive linemen, who are, almost by definition, solid guys.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it really doesn't matter what kind of a player a guy
is or was. What matters is the strength of his character and what
he stands for. The mirror may be cracked, but on either side the
view is still pretty good.

   Congress caught up with the times last month and repealed the
Depression-era law that divided the banking, securities and
insurance industries.
</P>
<P>
   Banks had been getting around the law by setting up holding
companies that purchased brokerages and insurance companies, but
maintained the firewalls between the three businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But as the globalization of the economy forced U.S. financial
institutions into direct competition with foreign entities without
the same restraints, corporate leaders pushed Congress to pass a
new law.
</P>
<P>
   The result is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley law, which is named for
Texas Republican Sen. Phil Gramm and touted by him as the most
important banking bill in 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   It allows all sides of the financial services triangle to merge
and sell each other's products. Soon, you will be able to go to
your bank branch and talk to one person to apply for a loan, buy
stock and increase your life insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOW WILL CONSUMERS BENEFIT? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What Big Business gets out of this is obvious: new ways to make
money.
</P>
<P>
   But what consumers get remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother used to be the idea about what government was,''
says Rob Schneider, staff attorney for the Austin, Texas, office of
the Consumers Union. ``More and more it's about the information
that corporations collect on us and that we have no oversight over
how it's used.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Travelers Group and Citicorp got approval last year
for their $72 billion merger, banks have been merging to keep up
and heralding the day when they will be one-stop financial shops.
</P>
<P>
   To compete, brokerages and insurance companies have rushed to
remake themselves into trusted financial advisers that do more than
sell stock and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Now that this new banking era has arrived, expect more corporate
marriages to produce financial giants that will dominate the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the new law say all the consolidating will save the
nation's consumers $15 billion annually in reduced fees and
charges. They point to the deregulation of the telephone industry
as an example of what is to come.
</P>
<P>
   But if you look at all the bank mergers in the past few years,
you'd be hard pressed to find a bank that significantly lowered its
fees after the marriage. Schneider says studies have shown you
still get your best interest rate deals on loans at credit unions
and small local banks.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the big banks don't turn out to be the convenient,
cost-effective option that you're looking for, you still have your
small home-grown banks.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if your community bank decides it doesn't want
to lend you money?
</P>
<P>
   The new law relaxed enforcement of the Community Reinvestment
Act, which requires national and local banks to make loans in
neighborhoods the banks had neglected. Now any bank that receives a
satisfactory or higher CRA rating won't be audited again by federal
regulators for at least four years.
</P>
<P>
   Through meeting CRA requirements, banks learned that lending in
low-income and minority communities can be profitable. But the
inevitable economic downturn will come and someone needs to make
sure banks don't go back to ignoring some neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Find out how your bank plans to maintain its satisfactory or
excellent rating and hold them to those commitments.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PRIVACY NEEDS MORE PROTECTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You also need to know that these new financial services
superstores don't have to ask your permission before passing on
your financial information to their subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   They just have to tell you what procedures they have in place to
to protect your privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Congress did give you the right to ask in writing that the
details of your financial life not be shared with telemarketers and
other companies outside the corporation. But it also gave
businesses a loophole. They can tell telemarketers and other third
parties all about you, as long as the outsider agrees not to pass
on the information.
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute amendment gave states the leeway to write stricter
privacy laws, but handling this issue in a piecemeal way could
leave some consumers unprotected. Count on the financial
institutions to battle more restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   As we wait to see how things shake out, we need to tell our
financial institutions what we want them to do. We are not
powerless in this brave new world of banking.
</P>
<P>
   We get a say every time we write a letter or a check.
</P>

A GOOD TIME FOR REFLECTION AND CELEBRATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The anticipation of the new millennium _ spurred
on by countless publicists and marketing gurus _ has been building
for months now, even though its technical arrival, according to the
way we number our calendar, will be Jan. 1, 2001, still a year
away.
</P>
<P>
   But technicalities aside, the transition from 1999 to 2000 is a
good time for reflection and celebration. So, in the seasonal
spirit, here are some of my reflections:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; H  &LR; _ Historic. Let's hear it one more time for the previous
century, which took us from the horse and buggy to the space and
computer age in a mere 100 years. It produced an amazing collection
of advancements, tragedies and triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A  &LR; _ Answers. Don't believe a political candidate in the new
year who claims that he or she has them all.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; P  &LR; _ Presidential race. This will certainly be the dominant
political story of 2000. Texas Gov. George W. Bush is still the
front-runner for the Republican nomination, but he will have to
fight to win it.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Arizona Sen. John McCain will be a tough
competitor in New Hampshire's key, early primary. The race for the
Democratic nomination is still a toss-up between Al Gore and Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; P  &LR; _ Performance. Gov. Bush's mediocre performances in his
first two presidential debates raised questions about his readiness
for the Free World's top job. He did much better in his third
debate in Iowa, holding his own and maybe scoring a point or two
against chief rival John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The more ``free-flowing'' format of the latest candidate forum
may have been more suited to the governor's style. He also
benefited from the practice he received in his first two
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Y  &LR; _ Year (old). Gov. Bush's presidential plunge dominated the
political news so much in 1999 that it is easy to forget that the
Texas Legislature was in session for the first five months.
Lawmakers enacted some modest tax cuts and, more importantly for
the long term, increased funding for public education, cracked down
on social promotions in the schools, boosted health care for
low-income children and lowered the blood alcohol content limit for
drunken driving. For better or worse _ time will tell which _ they
also deregulated electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; H  &LR; _ Health care. This will remain a burning issue. Political
candidates will promise reforms and improvements, but many people
will remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; O  &LR; _ Odd-numbered year. The new year will not be one. So state
legislators will be at home, trying to get re-elected, rather than
at the state Capitol, trying to make and kill laws.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; L  &LR; _ Losses. Many people lost someone in 1999. On a statewide
level, we marked the passing of Bob Bullock, a legendary figure who
had more influence over state government than any other single
individual in recent memory. On a personal note, we in the Houston
Chronicle's Austin Bureau mourned the death of Nadine Thompson, our
longtime secretary and receptionist and a kind and gentle friend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I  &LR; _ Ideas. Images. Political campaigns should be about ideas,
and many candidates actually offer some. Usually, however,
candidates spend more time and money fashioning or altering their
images, and image-conscious media consultants will make a ton of
money in the 2000 campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; D  &LR; _ Democrats. The Texas Democratic Party begins 2000 as it
began 1999 _ struggling. Democrats hold no statewide elected
offices in Texas. The party so far has been unable to recruit a
viable challenger for U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. And if Gov.
Bush wins the Republican presidential nomination, the Democratic
nominee can forget about Texas, except for hitting up labor unions
and trial lawyers for campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats will declare victory in 2000 if they can hold onto
their slim majority in the Texas House. If they can also reclaim a
majority in the state Senate, which is possible, they will be
beside themselves with glee.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A  &LR; _ Another year. The dispute over legal fees in Texas'
tobacco case didn't go away in 1999. The outside lawyers hired by
former Attorney General Dan Morales to fight the cigarette makers
told a federal judge that they will take huge payments from tobacco
companies and not from Texas taxpayers. That was a victory for
Morales' successor, John Cornyn, but Cornyn says he is still
investigating the lawyers' conduct. The lawyers deny any wrongdoing
and say the state should be grateful for the $17.3 billion
settlement they helped negotiate. How much longer will this soap
opera last? Another year? Another millennium?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Y  &LR; _ Y2K. The more advanced we become, the more helpless we are
without our advancements. Most people seem to be betting, though,
that predictions of Y2K disruptions will prove to be overblown.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; S  &LR; _ So long. Till 2000.
</P>

 CUSTOMS AGENTS HONORED FOR STOPPING BOMB SUSPECT  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By Mark Helm  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers on Monday
honored the four U.S. Customs Service inspectors who arrested a
suspected terrorist last week after discovering bomb-making
materials in his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men and women are true heroes,'' Summers told a packed
auditorium at the Ronald Reagan Building here. ``Thank you on
behalf on all Americans for making our country safer and
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary then presented Inspectors Diana M. Dean, Mark
Johnson and Carmon Clem with the department's exceptional service
award. Inspector Mike Chapman, who was unable to attend the
ceremony, will be given the award in Port Angeles, Wash., where all
four inspectors work.
</P>
<P>
   After the final medal was awarded, the crowd of more than 1,000
people, most of whom were U.S. Customs Service employees, gave the
inspectors a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agents, the suspect, Ahmed Ressam, 32, arrived
at Port Angeles, about 60 miles northwest of Seattle, around 6 p.m.
last Tuesday (Dec. 14) on a ferry from Victoria, British Columbia,
driving a Chrysler that he had rented in Canada. His car was the
last one off the ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said the Algerian-born Ressam was ``acting nervous'' while
she asked him routine questions about what was in his car and what
he would be doing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``After working on this job awhile, you get a knack for knowing
when something isn't right,'' said the 19-year veteran agent.
</P>
<P>
   Dean asked Ressam to step out of his car. While she and Johnson
questioned him, Clem began looking through the car. According to
Dean, Ressam gave her false identification papers that said his
name was Benni Noris.
</P>
<P>
   Clem's examination of the car uncovered a number of
false-identity cards, including at least eight credit cards, a
passport and other material under the name Noris.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clem lifted a mat in the trunk of the car to inspect the
well where the spare tire is usually stored. There was no spare
tire. Instead, he found 10 plastic bags containing 118 pounds of a
fine white powder; two plastic containers with 14 pounds of a
crystalline powder; two 22-ounce jars, each about three-quarters
full of a yellowish liquid, and four small black boxes that each
contained a circuit board connected to a Casio watch and a 9-volt
battery. The materials in the black boxes could be used to time a
detonator.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought it was drugs, which is something we come
across much more often,'' Clem said.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering the explosive materials, Dean and Johnson led
the suspect away from the car, but Ressam ``squirmed'' free and
ran, Johnson said. ``One second I have a hold of him; the next, I'm
standing there with an empty coat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, Clem and Chapman chased Ressam for about six blocks,
then spotted him trying to open the door of a car that had slowed
at an intersection. The female driver sped away, and the suspect
was then tackled in the street, according to the Johnson and Clem.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was arrested that day, and last Friday he was charged in
U.S. District Court in Seattle with smuggling explosives into the
United States from Canada and giving false information to U.S.
Customs agents.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam's real identity was determined through fingerprinting
with the help of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, according to
customs officials. He had served a short term for stealing
computers and other equipment and was being sought for other
burglaries, the agents said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI, the crystalline powder found in Ressam's
car was a sulfate used primarily to absorb water and keep things
dry, and the fine white powder was urea, used to manufacture
explosives and fertilizer. Urea was used in the 1993 World Trade
Center bombing in New York City, which killed six people and
injured 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   A massive search is under way for a possible accomplice or
accomplices because Ressam is suspected of acting as a courier for
an unknown terrorist group and because he did not have all of the
elements needed to make a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is trying to determine if Ressam was acting at
the behest of Osama Bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi radical who is
wanted for allegedly ordering the bombing of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is believed to be in Afghanistan, and his main access
to the rest of the world is thought to be through supporters in
Pakistan. Officias here are concerned because the Muslim holy
season of Ramadan coincides with celebrations marking the turn of
the century and the second millennium of Christianity _ a
convergence that authorities fear could entice extremists to resort
to violence.Summers said the Customs Service will deploy extra
inspectors to ports of entry around the country to try to prevent
terrorists from smuggling explosives or weapons into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there are no guarantees when it comes to terrorists,
I firmly believe that with agents such as the ones on this stage,
we will be able to keep our country safe,'' Summers said.

   GREGORIAN CHANT IN SPAIN
</P>
<P>
   Q. When in Madrid I would like to visit the Monastery of Santo
Domingo de Solis, renowned for concerts of Gregorian chants. Can
you tell me about trains or buses to the monastery, visiting hours
and how to arrange attending a concert? _ Victor M. Palacios,
Staten Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The monastery, one of the oldest in Spain, is believed to
have been founded in the seventh century. Among the outstanding
elements of sculpture in the cloisters are biblical scenes, plants
and animals.
</P>
<P>
   Those considering mass transit from Madrid will find that
Saturday is the only day one can visit Santo Domingo de Silos,
which involves traveling by bus or train for three hours to Burgos
and then a 90-minute bus ride to Santo Domingo de Silos. On Monday
to Friday, the one bus a day from Burgos to Santo Domingo de Silos
arrives too late to catch the start of the 7 p.m. service, the last
one before visiting hours end at 9:30. On Sunday, there are no
buses. But on Saturday the bus from Burgos leaves at 2 p.m. (fare:
$3.80, based on 165 pesetas to the dollar).
</P>
<P>
   So you can take a train for Burgos from the Chamartin Station in
Madrid at 9:20 a.m. and arrive at 12:30 p.m. or the 10 a.m. and
arrive at 1:26 p.m. The fare is $43 first class, $31 second class.
Information: Rail Europe, (800) 438-7245. If you prefer a bus, take
Continental Auto, at Calle Alenza, 20, telephone (34) 91 533 0400.
The fare is $11.80 one way. To play it safe, you will want to leave
by 9. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bus line from Burgos to Santo Domingo de Silos is Autocares
Arceredillo. Telephone: (34) 947 48 52 66 or (34) 947 26 83 47. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the monastery, there are no Gregorian chant concerts as such.
Rather, the Gregorian chant is part of the service. The church is
open to visitors, with tours Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 2
p.m. and from 4 to 9:30 p.m. The hours at the cloister are Tuesday
through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2:30 to 6 p.m., and
Sunday and Monday 2:30 to 6 p.m. A guided tour is $1.50. Entry is
free on Monday, but there is no guided tour.
</P>
<P>
   Services take place at 6 and 7:30 a.m. (8 on Sunday) and at
1:45, 7 and 9:40 p.m., with Mass at 9 a.m. (noon on Sundays and
holidays).
</P>
<P>
   Two alternatives to mass transit are renting a car in Madrid and
taking a 10-hour excursion such as one run by Ole Spain Tours in
Madrid, (34-91) 551 52 94, fax (34-91) 501 18 35;
www.olespaintours.com. The tour operates when visitors express an
interest in taking it. With a driver-guide, participants travel
across the Somosierra Mountains, stopping in Lerma and the historic
town of Covarrubias on the way to Santo Domingo de Silos. If there
are one to four passengers, the car is a Mercedes-Benz or the like;
for five or six, there's a minivan. Some sample per-person charges:
a total of two passengers, $181.50; four, $90.75; six, $69.75.
Meals are not included.

monastery, visit

<P>
   STORAGE AT ZURICH AIRPORT
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does the Zurich Airport have storage lockers? We would like
to store luggage needed for a cruise, but not while we drive for a
week. _ Mary Grimes, Fairborn, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   A. The airport has lockers in both the arrival and departure
terminals. The cost per day is $3.15 a day per suitcase, based on
1.59 Swiss francs to the dollar. There is no discount for longer
storage. Should you need a luggage cart, you can get one free in
the baggage claim area, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK CONCERTS
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife, mother-in-law and I are looking for a company to
make arrangements for a New York trip in May or June for, say, four
or five classical music concerts but only one or two operas. _
Robert Jordan, Vancouver, British Columbia
</P>
<P>
   A. Though there are companies that can try to get concert
tickets _ and arrange for hotels, if you wish _ they do not have
concert tickets in stock, as they might for a Broadway show. So
there is no certainty that you will get what you want.
</P>
<P>
   In timing your trip, you might take note of the final
performances for the 1999-2000 season: the New York City Opera,
April 23; the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, May 5; the
Metropolitan Opera, May 6, and the New York Philharmonic, June 3.
And at Carnegie Hall, once you get into May or June, the calendar
is not brimming with nationally known performers either.
</P>
<P>
   But those months are a fine time for dance, what with the
American Ballet Theater at the Met from May 8 to July 1 and the New
York City Ballet is at the New York State Theater from April 25 to
June 25.
</P>
<P>
   One company that can help plan your visit is Keith Prowse, 234
West 44th St., New York, N.Y. 10036; (800) 669-8687, fax (914)
644-8671. A five-night stay at the Roger Smith Hotel, on Lexington
Avenue near 48th Street, with four concerts will cost about $920 a
person, based on double occupancy, according to Jeremy Fenn-Smith
of the sales and marketing staff. Just what performances and dates
are ultimately selected will affect the price. If you just want
tickets, the cost of a seat at a New York Philharmonic concert will
typically range from $96.25 to $115, which reflects a 25 percent
charge for booking and handling.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is RMP Travel, 301 West 53rd St., New York,
N.Y. 10019; (212) 581-8051, fax (212) 956-8063. It tacks on a $25
service charge per ticket, according to Brigitta Haas,
international tour coordinator. Sample rates at two hotels RMP uses
are the following, per person, double occupancy: the Helmsley
Windsor Hotel, 100 West 58th St., is $470, and the Millennium
Broadway, 145 West 44th St., $620. Again, the dates will determine
the precise cost.
</P>
<P>
   You also might want to try Lincoln Center Visitors Services,
which designs packages that include a tour of Lincoln Center
theaters and concert halls; a beverage and dessert, or a full meal;
a concert and, perhaps, a preconcert lecture. Information: (212)
875-5370, fax (212) 875-5330.
</P>
<P>
   To cut costs, you might get in touch with the major halls
directly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For events at Lincoln Center, the number for information is
(212) 546-2656; for tickets, (212) 721-6500. The service and
handling charge is $5.75 a ticket. Events at Avery Fisher Hall and
Alice Tully Hall are listed on www.lincolncenter.org, those at the
Met are on www.metopera.org.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Hall, &UR;  &LR; (212) 247-7800; www.carnegiehall.org. A service
and handling charge of $4.75 a ticket applies to online, fax and
phone orders.  &QL;

BRIGHT LIGHTS, SIN CITY: `PORTRAITS' OF VEGAS' MOVERS AND SHAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
 (RESENDING TO FIX TYPO IN HUNTINGTON PRESS WEBSITE AT END)  
 ``THE FIRST 100:  PORTRAITS OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SHAPED LAS
VEGAS'' 
  
 By A.D. Hopkins and K.J. Evans from the archives of 
 the ``Las Vegas Review-Journal''  (Huntington Press, $34.95) 
 &HT;     By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not just slot-machine feeders finding the new Las Vegas to
be an irresistible attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers, too, are squinting into the Strip's bright lights
and seeing dollar signs.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford University Press recently published a collection of
essays titled ``The Real Las Vegas: Life Beyond the Strip.''
Villard Books offers Andres Martinez's ``24/7: Living It Up and
Doubling Down in the New Las Vegas.'' Early next year, Bantam
Doubleday Dell will sell Pete Earley's ``Super Casino.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. Combine Sin City's colorful past with its current
boom, and you've got a sizzling 20th century story.
</P>
<P>
   Readers interested in the finer details of that story could
start with ``The First 100,'' a new book from Las Vegas publisher
Huntington Press.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of profiles, the book _ actually a reprint of a
massive project by the ``Las Vegas Review-Journal'' _ tells the
city's history through its people. It was an end-of-the-century
undertaking designed to document a place perpetually engaged in
furious re-invention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people I almost cried for not getting to meet,''
said A.D. Hopkins, who with K.J. Evans oversaw the project for the
``Review-Journal.'' ``For a lot of these people, there was no
archival material. For a lot of people here, we were establishing
the archival material.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The First 100'' includes the people behind some familiar Las
Vegas names and landmarks, including John C. Fremont, Harley
Harmon, James Cashman, Pat McCarran and Benny Binion.
</P>
<P>
   Also here are the peculiarly Las Vegas histories of marquee
names such as Caesars Palace and Circus Circus builder Jay Sarno,
Donn Arden (credited with perfecting the over-the-top _ and
sometimes topless _ showroom spectacular), Benjamin (don't call him
``Bugsy'') Siegel, Frank Sinatra, Howard Hughes and Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of entries examines lesser-knowns while telling the
unlikely tale of how a mixture of Mormons, mobsters and
multimillionaires built a premier vice-tourism destination from raw
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, a 30-year Las Vegas veteran, once edited the
``Review-Journal's''history-heavy (but now, alas, defunct) Sunday
magazine, ``Nevadan.'' Hopkins personally wrote many of the
entries, as did the late K.J. Evans, another former ``Nevadan''
editor. (The entire project is also archived online at
www.lvrj.com, the paper's Web site.)
</P>
<P>
   Currently a special-projects editor for the paper, Hopkins, 56,
said a list of 300 profile subjects was suggested by readers, as
well as a committee of historians and ``Review-Journal'' staffers.
</P>
<P>
   The first big list ranged from beloved grade-school teachers to
beauty queens, bankers to burlesque stars. The final cut didn't
limit the list to the merely historically important.
</P>
<P>
   A considerable dose of imagination went into the selection
process. How else to explain the inclusion of John Seibold, who
popularized Las Vegas-based sightseeing flights over the Grand
Canyon? Or fabled hypemeister Bob Stupak, who was inspired to build
the Stratosphere Tower when a heavy windstorm blew down the sign in
front of his tacky Vegas World casino?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (the nominees) were important, but not very
interesting,'' Hopkins said. ``They were supposed to have a
long-term effect, but if there was a story that we wanted to tell,
we wouldn't let it slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins admitted that many of the people who didn't make the
final list were as fascinating as those who did. Take Larry Snow,
who popularized the game baccarat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baccarat makes money for hotels,'' Hopkins said. ``Sometimes
it's the difference between profit and loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Or John Stuart, who pioneered the celebrity-impersonator show.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a lot of those, and it was his idea,''
Hopkins said. ``If you come up with a winning idea, a trend in
entertainment that shows no sign of of quitting, that's worth
something. That's a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been 150, he'd have made it.'' &QL;

MINGHELLA CAN'T RESIST THE `NOVEL' APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, Anthony Minghella had a career high. The
playwright, screenwriter and director's ``The English Patient'' won
nine Oscars _ including best picture, director and supporting
actress for Juliette Binoche.
</P>
<P>
   It's an experience the 45-year-old filmmaker would love to
replicate.
</P>
<P>
   If he does, it probably will be with an adaptation of another
novel.
</P>
<P>
   Though Minghella's acclaimed first film, ``Truly, Madly,
Deeply,'' was drawn from his own play, he's had extraordinary luck
adapting other people's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The English Patient'' was based on Michael Ondaatje's
best-selling novel about love, war and regret during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   This Christmas, he's back with ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,''
based on the first novel in a series of crime thrillers by Patricia
Highsmith.
</P>
<P>
   His next project is ``Cold Mountain,'' based on Charles
Frazier's best-selling and critically acclaimed Civil War novel,
which seems like perfect terrain for Minghella to explore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited by the idea of going on an adventure with
somebody else's map,'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The bearish, genial director made a brief stop in Seattle just a
day after he finished editing ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.'' It opens
on Christmas Day and he's understandably nervous about its
reception.
</P>
<P>
   He eases slightly after I remark that he is one of the best
cinema writers (along with fellow Brits David Hare and Stephen
Poliakoff), and goes to great lengths to tell me he ``didn't have a
plan to be somebody who adapted novels to film.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, he reverts to his original enthusiasm for doing what
he does so well. ``I think on a very banal level I get incredibly
excited by something I've read and I don't want to let go of it.
Then it takes me three years to get it out of my system. All that
time I'm thinking I'll go off and make some movie of my own;
something smaller. Then I read something else and convince myself
I'll do it quickly first and, of course, there is no `quickly.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I've seen that film can be a great medium to
advertise your passion about something else as well as one's own
preoccupations and, in fact, using material that already exists
doesn't stop you from making personal movies.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, he suggests, ``The English Patient'' and ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley'' are as intensely personal as ``Truly, Madly,
Deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a way of refreshing oneself and avoiding the same
noise repeatedly. It's still full of mysteries and secrets and,
because there is so much to do in translating the reading
experience into a story that you tell to other people, I feel
perfectly expressed in the process. I don't think very much about
the difference between a book and a film.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what he does when making a film, Minghella says, is
sharing the things that have excited him _ things like ``what Matt
Damon can do or how extraordinary some Spanish steps are when you
crane up on them at six in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he first read Highsmith's novel many years ago. ``I'd
written a play and someone wrote that it reminded them of a
Patricia Highsmith work. Of course, I went out and bought the book
and found this character, Tom Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   The book by the American-born crime writer was filmed with more
chilly perversity in Rene Clement's 1960 classic ``Purple Noon,''
starring French film idol Alain Delon. But that didn't concern
Minghella as he took on the novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the heart of the book, which is so original,'' that
made him want to do it his way. ``A man goes on an errand and
becomes obsessed with the person he's sent to bring home. He wants
to be with him and love him. That's too distinctive to throw
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Minghella's version plumbs that dormant homoerotic subtext more
fully than Clement's. Ripley, a struggling nobody, is sent to Italy
to bring home a wealthy American golden boy, shipping heir Dickie
Greenleaf, who is living a life of ease and frivolity with his
fiancee. She first embraces Tom and then suspects him of murder
after Dickie disappears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' is a seductive guilty pleasure,
visually gorgeous and brimming with beautiful talent: Jude Law as
Dickie, Gwyneth Paltrow as fiancee Marge Sherwood, Matt Damon as
Ripley and Cate Blanchett in a role that Minghella specifically
added as a ``moral harbinger'' of Ripley's transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love her character,'' Minghella says. ``Every time I went
back to the screenplay, I wrote a bit more for her. She's so funny
and I know it's absurd, but I kept thinking of Lucille Ball. Giddy
is the perfect word; she's like an armada, all elbows and knees and
very gauche, and I think the character writes a journal entry every
time something happens to her. I told that to Cate who said, `I
know, I know,' and it was the only clue she needed. After that she
was free and she flew.''
</P>
<P>
   The director says the thing he most remembers about the book is
the ``yearning'' Ripley has. ``He's desperate to be loved by
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Minghella has refused to shy away from what might be construed
as a gay serial-killer film. In fact, it's anything but. Ripley
defies sexual identity, so great is his need to be anything but
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``To dilute the complexity of that would be a shame,'' says
Minghella in response to the concern that Ripley might be
misjudged. ``I wasn't trying to be iconoclastic. It's what is
original about the story. To make it conventional and safe would
have taken away the reason to make the film. It's the skinlessness
of Ripley, the tenderness of him. I feel it's a big mistake to
undervalue what an audience is capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   Minghella says when he cast the film ``nothing had yet happened
for any of them,'' referring to his lineup of young Oscar winners
and nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cast very much like we're having this conversation,'' he
says. ``I don't read actors, I don't meet them with other people. I
try to get an intimate connection with them so I can try to work
out whether they're fellow travelers with me or not. Since
everything about me is in the screenplay, how they react is
instructive. There's a great deal spoken of the alchemy between
actors on film, but what's critical is whether I can help them and
they can help me.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each of these actors I was excited by the work they had
done, particularly Matt, who was such a fellow spirit when I met
him that, when he spoke about the film, it was exactly how I'd
experienced it as a writer. He seemed in concert with what
fascinated me about the character; he was fearless about what it
required him to do and I trusted that. I try not to invest in who
is currently glamorous when I cast.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' Paltrow, last year's best
actress Oscar winner, plays a role ``which is not a vehicle.
Already there was so much expectation for her and to play what is
essentially a character part and to be modest in the way she
approached it _ and to show that she's an actor first and a movie
star second _ was all I was interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited by actors and what they do,'' Minghella adds.
``There is a humanity to actors, a vulnerability, and if you can
make actors feel safe, they'll give you so much back. No matter how
much you plan and write a moment, it's ultimately better to be
surprised by what an actor can bring.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, he contends, is essential in a film that is all about
ambiguity and accountability. ``This is a film about a person whose
actions are reprehensible, yet the film is about morality. It asks
a great deal of an audience. Will they recognize the difference
between public retribution and judgment and that a man is in a
prison he can't escape from? It's a tragedy, but it has a much more
mischievious rhythm. At face value, this film says you can kill
people and get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to put all my hope and trust into the fact that
audiences will see the film arguing with its own subject matter.''
Minghella concludes. ``You can't get away with anything really.
Though this character is blessed with the ability to improvise his
way out of problems, he's cursed by that ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ripley's talent is the thing which sentences him to
solitary confinement.''

INS TO CONTINUE CAMPAIGN TO ADD MORE BORDER AGENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Immigration and Naturalization Service said
Monday that it will press ahead with a $2.2 million effort to
recruit more Border Patrol agents and avoid a repeat of last year,
when INS fell well short of its goal of adding 1,000 officers.
</P>
<P>
   The INS' pledge to beef up its hiring of agents followed a
report that the Border Patrol gained only 369 officers in fiscal
year 1999, which ended Sept. 30. That increase raised to 8,351 the
number of patrol agents, 631 short of its goal, the General
Accounting Office reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 8,351 agents, 3,591 served along the Texas border with
Mexico. The 1999 Texas figure marked an increase from 3,460 agents
at the end of fiscal year 1998, the INS reported.
</P>
<P>
   The INS attributed its failure to meet the hiring goal to a
robust national economy and job market, which prompted many
would-be agents to opt for the more lucrative private sector.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the INS said it has generally hired about 4 percent
of its eligible Border Patrol applicants in past years. But, in the
tough 1999 labor market, it hired only 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To compete with private companies, the INS said it will consider
paying bonuses to new recruits and raising starting salaries, which
generally range from $30,451 to $42,531 per year with overtime. The
agency added that it will train more than 200 current Border Patrol
officers to help in the recruitment effort.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1999, the INS suffered a four-year low in the number
of new Border Patrol hires. The 1,126 new agents failed to
compensate sufficiently for an uncommonly low attrition rate, 9
percent, in the patrol last year, reported GAO, an investigative
arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators placed much of the blame for the hiring shortage
on INS' failure to find enough qualified applicants and to retain
recruits through the employment process. The agency's recruitment
methods of media and billboard advertisements and campus hirings,
which had worked well in past fiscal years, failed in 1999, the GAO
said.
</P>
<P>
   One area where the INS fell short was in getting many of the
applicants who signed up for the Border Patrol's written
examination to actually take the test.
</P>
<P>
   Only 25 percent of the candidates who scheduled to sit for the
Border Patrol exam actually took it, the GAO said. The attendance
rate in prior years was a relatively high 40 percent, investigators
added.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO offered no explanation for the shortage of exam takers
and faulted the INS for failing to adequately survey applicants who
canceled their plans to join the Border Patrol. Information gleaned
from such inquiries of former candidates, especially those who had
quit late in the application process, could help the INS reverse
the reduction in new hires, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When faced with an impending hiring shortfall for fiscal year
1999, INS officials expanded their recruiting and hiring efforts in
an attempt to meet INS' hiring goal,'' the report stated.
``However, because INS had limited information on why applicants
withdrew from the hiring process, it may not be addressing all the
causes for the shortfall.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS declined to comment on whether the shortfall will
undermine the agency's ability to thwart illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continuing to be vigilant along the borders,'' said INS
spokeswoman Nicole Chulick.
</P>
<P>
   INS chief Doris Meissner recently hailed the Border Patrol in
Texas as a model for law enforcement, saying that its forceful
presence has led to a 19 percent drop in crime near the border at
Brownsville since 1997. But Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, a leading
INS critic, has countered that illegal immigration remains a
problem in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to GAO's recommendation, the INS said it plans to
evaluate the feasibility of improving its system of surveying
applicants who withdraw from Border Patrol consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in an effort to stem the flow of illegal immigration,
called on the INS in 1996 to increase the Border Patrol's ranks by
1,000 agents in fiscal years 1997 through 2001. The INS exceeded
the congressional goal in 1997 and 1998, raising the number of
agents by a total of 2,037.
</P>
<P>
   But fiscal year 1999 tarnished INS' earlier success, as the net
increase of 369 agents raised the three-year total to only 2,406
new officers, resulting in a shortfall of 594 agents from the
three-year goal of 3,000, the GAO reported.

NATO FORCES ARREST BOSNIAN SERB GENERAL ON WAR CRIMES CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VELIZY-VILLACOUBLAY, France _ NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia on
Monday arrested a former Bosnian Serb general charged with war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Bosnia said that British troops in the zone that
they control blocked a vehicle carrying retired Maj. Gen. Stanislav
Ganic, commander of the Bosnian Serb forces that besieged Sarajevo
between 1992 and 1994. They arrested him under a sealed indictment
issued by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the American officer in command of all NATO
forces in Europe, said as he arrived here at an air base outside
Paris that the arrest showed that the standing orders on handling
indicted war criminals could be effective. The orders had been
criticized for not leading to enough arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced we have the right policy,'' Clark said in an
interview. He arrived here for a talk with the French army's chief
of staff, Gen. Jean-Pierre Kelche. ``Its implementation, in a
culture in which we're outsiders, is extraordinarily difficult,''
Clark said of the policy.
</P>
<P>
   His orders allow peacekeepers to arrest suspects they run across
in the normal course of their duties when they believe it is
prudent to do so and when no bystanders will get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the NATO forces have acquitted themselves very well in
terms of war-criminal detentions, and the deterrent effect,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But 12 of the 15 arrests made in Bosnia, including Monday's,
have been by British troops. Both French forces, who have made no
arrests, and American forces in Bosnia have come under heavy
criticism from human rights groups for not going more aggressively
after leaders charged with war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Galic, The Hague tribunal said, is charged with crimes against
humanity and violations of war conventions in ordering shelling and
sniping that killed, maimed, and wounded thousands of civilians in
Sarajevo during the Bosnian war siege.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those accused of war crimes who have been
arrested, 21 have surrendered. Charges have been brought against
63. ``Still,'' Clark said, ``we're acutely conscious of the fact
that some of the most egregious of the accused have not thus far
been detained.''
</P>
<P>
   Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the top civilian and
military leaders of the Bosnian Serbs during the war, have not been
arrested. Karadzic is believed to be hiding in the French sector in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Clark will relinquish his command in April to Gen. Joseph
Ralston, at which time there will still be 20,000 peacekeepers from
37 countries, including the United States and Russia, in Bosnia.
But they and many of the thousands of peacekeepers in Kosovo may
have to stay for years.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, recalling the allied air operation against Serbian forces
last spring in Kosovo, said that the allies had come closer than
most people realized to launching a ground attack against the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came quite close to a ground operation at the outset,'' he
said, because allied forces gathering in Macedonia were within
range of Serb artillery based in southern Serbia and inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three American servicemen who were kidnapped inside
Macedonia,'' he said _ they were freed after a visit to Belgrade by
the Rev. Jesse Jackson _ ``and we had Serb-inspired and
Serb-directed mobs that sacked five embassies in Skopje one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we were, at that point, nearing a defensive operation to
protect Macedonia,'' the general said. ``Then, as we went further
into the campaign, this threat seemed to recede.''
</P>
<P>
   But President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, Clark said, saw
that by early June, allied leaders were coming closer to ordering a
ground attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the competing military demands and political concerns
emerged the policy,'' he said. ''I think the bottom-line assessment
is that we were successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied diplomacy succeeded in keeping Russia or other countries
opposed to the allied bombing from coming to the aid of Yugoslavia,
in Clark's view.
</P>
<P>
   He was not prepared to say that he had been wrong to order Gen.
Michael Jackson, the British commander who led NATO troops into
Kosovo last June, to seize Pristina airfield when a Russian armored
convoy arrived in a surprise post-midnight foray.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson sent the order to London, where his superiors,
backed by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in Washington,
overruled Clark. The Russian convoy then staked out the ground as
its own.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, Clark said Monday, had been a policy issue, not a
personality issue between him and Jackson. ``Time will tell whether
it was a correct resolution or not,'' he said. ``We're very happy
to have the Russians with us in Kosovo.''

GRATEFUL MACANESE WELCOME CHINESE TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACAU _ China's troops streamed into this new Chinese territory
on Monday, in a joyful procession that revealed how deeply people
here yearn for law and order after the gangsterism that stained the
last years of Portuguese colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   At high noon, 12 hours after the solemn ceremony in which China
gained sovereignty over Macau, a convoy of armored personnel
carriers, buses and trucks rumbled across the border from
neighboring Zhuhai, on the Chinese mainland. Less than an hour
later, the 500 troops secured their objective: a makeshift barracks
in a vacant apartment building in the center of Macau.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people lined the route, cheering and waving
Chinese flags in a largely unscripted expression of hospitality. It
was a decided contrast to the handover of Hong Kong two and a half
years ago, when the arrival of the Chinese army was met with
ill-concealed dread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thrilled because the soldiers give me confidence,'' said
Lau Kit Leng, 34, a homemaker who waited outside on a bright but
chilly day. ``Security has been such a big problem in Macau. The
troops give me a reason to hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese army seems destined to play a very different role in
Macau than in Hong Kong. In well-policed Hong Kong, the troops have
kept a very low profile since the handover. They arrived in the
predawn darkness on July 1, 1997, and headed to their barracks,
where they have essentially remained since.
</P>
<P>
   In Macau, where the colonial administration could not stop a
gang war for control of the territory's lucrative casinos,
officials said the army would play a powerful symbolic role in
restoring law and order. On the streets Monday, several people said
that if the local police force was not up to the job, they would be
happy to see the army go after the gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they should get involved in that,'' Mrs. Lau said as
she sheltered her 4-year-old daughter from the biting wind.
``That's why they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Ho, the new chief executive of Macau, insisted that the
troops would not be used for police work. But he said they would
give people an overdue sense of safety. And he added that having a
garrison nearby would help him reform the Macau police force, which
has been plagued by corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of troops was a raw bone of contention between
China and Portugal in an otherwise smooth transfer of power.
Portugal, which withdrew its soldiers shortly after its revolution
in 1974, insisted that Macau was too small to require a military
garrison. And Portuguese officials said the joint declaration
governing the return of the colony did not provide for stationing
troops there.
</P>
<P>
   But early this year, China's deputy prime minister, Qian Qichen,
said the government planned to send an advance guard to the colony
even before the handover. His announcement came after other senior
Chinese leaders publicly chided the Portuguese for not doing more
to curb the gang wars.
</P>
<P>
   In March, President Jorge Sampaio of Portugal threatened to
boycott the handover ceremony if the Chinese did not explain why
they were not abiding by the agreement. After a visit to Lisbon by
China's president, Jiang Zemin, in October, Sampaio withdrew his
threat, saying he had been satisfied that the Chinese intended to
use the troops only for defense purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here on Sunday, Sampaio seemed eager to wash his
hands of the issue. ``China is China,'' he said. ``China has
sovereign rights. Macau is going to be a special region of China.''
By the time the Chinese troops arrived, the Portuguese president
and his entourage were long gone.

Y2K FEARS LEAD TO CANCELLATIONS AND PRICE-CUTTING FOR NEW YEAR'S
EVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the clock strikes midnight Friday, the throngs
in Times Square will be welcoming in a new year at what is expected
to be the biggest New Year's Eve party in the square's 95-year
history. But not everyone in New York will be in a festive mood,
especially those who banked on the changeover to the Year 2000 to
usher in big profits as well as big crowds. For them, the giant
ball descending from atop 1 Times Square will more than likely
symbolize fallen expectations.
</P>
<P>
   There was a general assumption that big millennium celebrations
would translate into people's clamoring to attend. But as it turns
out, many people have opted to stay home because of Y2K fears and
worry about travel and crowds. And unexpected resistance to high
prices has caused party cancellations, restaurants closing for the
night of the 31st and much lower rates on hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The same pattern of resistance is true in other cities from
Washington to Minneapolis-St. Paul to Los Angeles. Cruise ships
also managed to fill their millennium cruises only by scaling back
their inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   But for many Americans, New York is still the city most
synonymous with New Year's Eve partying and revelry, so
cancellation of the Celebration 2000 party scheduled for the Jacob
Javits Convention Center on New Year's Eve was particularly
embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   With Andrea Bocelli, Sting, Aretha Franklin and Tom Jones among
the scheduled performers, the tickets, priced at $1,000 to $2,500,
were presented as a bargain in a city where tickets to Broadway
shows cost upward of $75. Although Celebration 2000 eventually
scaled down plans and prices, the public stayed away, and the event
was scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Many other big-name events still have space available. These
include the dinner party with Champagne and dancing to three
different orchestras at the Waldorf-Astoria ($1,500 a person); the
Metropolitan Opera performance of Act II of ``Die Fledermaus''
followed by dinner and dancing on the tiers of the Opera House
($1,500 to $2,500); World Yacht dinner cruises with open bar and
live music ($550 to $999); dinner and dancing at the Rainbow Room
($3,000); a Madison Square Garden concert with Billy Joel, followed
by dinner and drinks ($153 to $1,002); Windows on the World ($300
in the bar, $2,000 with dinner in the dining room), and Samplings
restaurant, on the second floor of the Crowne Plaza in Times Square
(where $550 accords guests a six-course dinner meal with Champagne
and a close-up view of the crowd and the ball drop).
</P>
<P>
   Some of those prices have been lowered from original levels, and
some hotels that had planned to sell millennium packages have
abandoned the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most city hotels will be full or close to it, because
occupancy is always high over New Year's, and because New York has
only about 65,000 hotel rooms, compared with about 120,000 in Las
Vegas and 94,000 in Orlando, Fla. Moreover, even on a normal day _
and New York is anything but normal on New Year's Eve _ the city's
hotels are the costliest in the United States. At an average
$178.60 a day this year, according to Smith Travel Research, rates
are more than $40 higher than in San Francisco, the next most
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   To increase occupancy, many New York hotels lowered room rates
and dropped the four-night requirement to three or even two nights.
</P>
<P>
   For example, $695 rooms at the Waldorf-Astoria _ that's for one
day _ sold for $389 through Hotel Reservations Network, a
consolidator that still has rooms available in 12 New York hotels
(although the Waldorf is full). Rooms from $550 at the Hilton at
53rd Street and Avenue of the Americas sold for $179, while two
weeks ago the Central Park Inter-Continental New York listed its
rooms for the holiday with Priceline.com, discounting its posted
$389 daily rate to $250.
</P>
<P>
   The Michelangelo, at 51st Street and Seventh Avenue, considered
setting its four-night millennium packages at between $4,000 and
$8,000, but eventually made them $1,800 to $2,700 for three nights.
And three hotels that offered to rent their building and hotel
staff over New Year's Eve did not receive any takers.
</P>
<P>
   The 627-room Millennium Broadway in Times Square was asking $3
million rental from Dec. 31 through Jan. 2, but now has two-night
packages beginning at $550 a night. The 155-room Fitzpatrick Grand
Central Hotel at 44th between Lexington and Third Avenues was
asking $1.5 million rental, while the 92-room Fitzpatrick Manhattan
at Lexington and 57th Street was available for $1 million. When
neither found takers, they put together packages for $1,999 total
per room with a four-night minimum stay, or $400 a night per room
with a two-night minimum stay. All three hotels still have packages
available.
</P>
<P>
   This price cutting is little different from the yield management
widely practiced by airlines and cruise ships, which raise or lower
fares according to demand. Or from sales on clothing or other
slow-moving items in shops or department stores. What is different
is the refusal of many people, even during flush economic times, to
pay sky-high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are still bargains to be had in New York, including
the light show, fireworks and other free entertainment in Times
Square on Friday and into the new year. It will cost $7 for a
bird's eye view of the waning hours of the old year in 2000 from
atop the Empire State Building, which will open at 9:30 a.m. on
Friday and remain open until 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the city itself, the one that never sleeps.
Especially over New Year's.

PHOTOGRAPHER'S BOOK SHOOTS DOWN FEMININE STEREOTYPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW MARTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ Photographer Annie Leibovitz choreographs
her presence in the stark contrast of one of her black-and-white
shots. On this windy day in Miami Beach, the Atlantic's foamy
whitecaps paired with the egg-cream interior of the Tides Hotel to
form a pale backdrop to Leibovitz's brooding chic. With her
coal-black tails, turtleneck, pleated pants and watchband,
Leibovitz is a thundercloud of feral energy. It's a full Palm Pilot
day, and no lost hotel-room key, elevator breakdown or nagging cold
will derail her.
</P>
<P>
   No, the 5-foot-11-inch Leibovitz, who doesn't walk so much as
stride _ a predatory panther for space _ is not to be deterred. She
drowns her cold in a bath of chamomile tea spiked with Sue Bee
honey, satchels of pure vitamin C, and a room-service double
espresso _ hot milk on the side. It's her rocket fuel for a
promotional tour for ``Women'' ($75, Random House), Leibovitz's
latest collection of photographs, mixing her signature shots of the
notable and notorious with an assortment of perfectly obscure
women. A collaboration with writer Susan Sontag, who contributed
the book's introductory essay, Leibovitz's ``Women'' aims a
dispassionate, unpatronizing lens at the wide spectrum of women and
their pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme for `Women' is who women are and what women look
like,'' Leibovitz says, raking her hands through tendrils of
blond-streaked hair. ``There were no big revelations from the work.
I didn't learn anything new about women, except that I really was
able to see women as a group of individuals. The book is less about
gender and more about individuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her 30-year career, Annie Leibovitz has become the
f-stop Boswell to the infamously famous, the famously infamous, and
the garden-variety celebrity general, Olympic sprinter, Nobel Prize
winner, or Hollywood nymph du jour. At 50, she is arguably the most
recognized, if not the most accomplished, photographer of her
generation. Esteemed enough to have had several prints exhibited at
the National Portrait Gallery, Leibovitz is still insouciant enough
to mention a recent backstage photo session with Bruce Springsteen
as if it were a Kodak moment at a backyard barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Leibovitz first made her name chronicling for ``Rolling Stone''
magazine the purple haze of rock 'n' roll's early days. When she
hitched a ride on the Rolling Stones' 1975 tour, Leibovitz not only
memorialized but sampled some of the pagan pleasures of the day.
With her subsequent work for ``Vogue'' and ``Vanity Fair'' plus her
advertising-as-art campaigns for American Express, The Gap and the
dairy industry (think: milk mustaches), Leibovitz carved out her
place as a distinctive portraitist.
</P>
<P>
   Her contemporary work is drenched in color, meticulously groomed
and glossy. Leibovitz plots her photos with a wise-cracking style.
Using witty props, she gently twits the personae in question while
revealing something poignant embedded in the air-brushed image.
This mix of deference and cheekiness has resulted in some of
contemporary photography's most hagiographic works. Consider Whoopi
Goldberg bathing in a tub of white milk, or John Lennon, coiled up
in a naked fetal position of devotion to Yoko Ono only hours before
he was killed. Remember the late John Belushi looking like a
forlorn hobo on his last hitchhiking jaunt? Most recently,
Leibovitz positioned the cast from ``The Sopranos'' in a modern-day
``Last Supper'' pose, playing on the show's penchant for betrayal
and gourmand eating. ``I really am not a glamour photographer,''
Leibovitz says. ``In all of my work, I humanize the celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women,'' also the name of her splashy exhibition at
Washington, D.C.'s Corcoran Gallery of Art, breaks considerable new
territory by sending Leibovitz back to her reportage roots. It is a
throwback to on-the-fly production design. The project became a
hybrid of Leibovitz's ``Vogue'' and ``Vanity Fair'' work mixed with
her ramblings throughout America in search of women in all their
guises. The result is a Studs Terkel-on-celluloid gallery of female
farmers, bull riders, astronauts, socialites, maids, police
officers, carnival performers, doctors, corsaged debutantes and
factory workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonderful truth of this book is that if Freud had seen it,
he couldn't possibly say what women really want because every
individual woman as portrayed by Annie wants something different,''
says feminist activist Gloria Steinem, herself a subject in the
book.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Women'' contains more than 120 images in a pastiche of
formats. They are divided roughly in half between black-and-white
and color pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was figuring this whole thing out as I did it,'' admits
Leibovitz. ``I was afraid that I would never be able to do the
project justice. It really could have gone on and on without end.
Frankly, when it comes down to it, I didn't want to let women
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's first photo makes Leibovitz's breaking-the-mold
intentions clear. Her unflinching black-and-white study of her
mother, Marilyn Leibovitz, is neither brutally critical nor treacly
sentimental. It is a maternal study done with the ripened affection
of an older daughter. ``The shot of my mother is the book's
dedication,'' says Leibovitz. ``After all, she is the first woman I
ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the celebrity subjects, there is someone for everyone.
Actress Drew Barrymore lies supine on some California grass, her
diaphanous nightgown clinging to her downy skin. Martina
Navratilova, clad only in a Speedo swimsuit, hangs on with
Chaplinesque aplomb to an industrial gear-winch. Elizabeth Taylor,
accompanied by her faithful pooch, ``Sugar,'' is all Gloria Swanson
smile and vanity. And actress Christina Ricci is shot astride a
motel bed, clad only in a lacy camisole and sweater, exuding a
pouty Lolita-esque attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women'' does make some concessions to the powerful. In one of
the collection's most posed, and maybe least compelling shots,
Hillary Clinton peruses a document on a White House balcony, pen in
hand, a waxen study in gravitas.
</P>
<P>
   But these poised, camera-ready women are bit players in
``Women's'' drama, overshadowed by dozens of photos of women who
simply are. ``So this is what women are now _ as different, as
varied, as heroic, as forlorn, as conventional, as unconventional
as this,'' writes Sontag in the collection's preface.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Leibovitz's whole gallery of regular women radiates an
intrinsic beauty stripped of power-breakfast status or designer
fashions. There are the five female coal miners from Alabama's Jim
Walter No. 5 Mine, clothed in sooty thermal coveralls. There is
Lamis Srour, a teacher in Michigan whose coal-dark eyes stare out
from behind a black veil. And Shen Chu hunches over her sewing
machine, producing another garment for the Four Maples Ladies'
Blouse Co. in Manhattan's Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind that Annie worked very hard to make the project
be a lot more than just well-known celebrities,'' says Paige
Turner, assistant curator of exhibitions at the Corcoran Gallery of
Art. ``She wanted women who wouldn't be the first choice of a
fashion-magazine editor.''
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding mawkish pity, Leibovitz's portraits of anonymous abused
women is the kind of sobering work worthy of a crime-scene photo.
The two women, one from Connecticut, the other from New York,
display all the swollen-eye marks of domestic violence, yet retain
a resilient dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most of the photos, either the shots would be good or not
good, and if it wasn't good I wouldn't belabor it,'' says
Leibovitz. ``If it is good, frankly I probably didn't have so much
to do with it. I was simply a medium and it usually had more to do
with the sitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Annie Leibovitz spent her elementary-school years at Fort
Worth's Bruce Shulkey Elementary School (she can break out into the
school song on request), so it is no coincidence that she returned
to Texas often to photograph many of ``Women's'' subjects. Who best
to personify the Chanel-swathed ``ladies who lunch'' than the
troika of Pat Breen, Lynn Wyatt and Caroline Wiess Law caught in
mid-coffee, clucking at Tony's Restaurant in Houston? Then there's
former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, all aviators, khakis and pricey
shotgun, waiting to shoot the next lame duck. And no look at Texas
women would be complete without a shot of the Kilgore College
Rangerettes caught in a gravity-defying high kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas just has a great reservoir of subject matter,'' reflects
Leibovitz. ``Just a little visual statement on a Texas subject goes
a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   But no other series of photos crystallizes Leibovitz's theme of
the multifaceted roles women play than in her Las Vegas showgirl
series. In several ``before'' and ``after'' poses, four showgirls
are first displayed in their civies of halter tops and bluejeans.
Then, in vibrant color shots, the women disappear behind their
performing battle gear of rouge and rhinestone bustiers.
Leibovitz's shots transport the dancers from understated
embodiments of feminity to comic-book caricatures of pulchritude.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the most important pictures in the collection,'' says
Leibovitz. ``One of the dancers showed up looking a little like
Joyce Carol Oates before donning her Vegas costume and suddenly
becoming empowered by this armor. It just completely supported
Susan Sontag's line about women dressing up to look like `women.'
''
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   As the sun dips below Miami Beach's blushing horizon, Annie
Leibovitz awaits her room-service order (it has to be taken up
eight flights of stairs because of a conked-out elevator) and takes
some time to deconstruct her ``Women's'' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, making the final edits proved to be quite difficult,
knowing that it was completely up to me,'' says Leibovitz between
restorative sips of chamomile tea. ``But then it became a very
freeing experience. I became this monster, and there was no turning
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking back to ``Women's'' origins in November 1995, Leibovitz
recounted her peripatetic cycle of photo sessions. In one frequent
flying odyssey, Leibovitz jetted to Taos, N.M., to shoot painter
Agnes Martin before hopping over to Los Angeles for a Courtney Love
session, only to red-eye it back to the East Coast for a 5 a.m.
bulb-garden photo-op with Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``In between her insanely busy schedule for `Vanity Fair' or
`Vogue,' she would make time to shoot cheerleaders in Texas,'' says
David Harris, design director at `Vanity Fair.' ``At the end, I
think Annie produced some of the best work she's ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that level of perfection, Leibovitz would seek out
the most perfect locale. She reportedly drove around rural Oklahoma
for four hours to find the desolate area near the headquarters of
the Cherokee nation for the pickup truck shot of Gloria Steinem and
Wilma Mankiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that very Oklahoma moment, Annie caught us on the edge of
that truck, understanding that Wilma and I are very close
friends,'' recalls Steinem. ``Trying to show life, not artifice,
adding a bit of Diane Arbus realism _ it all says such good things
about Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   The operative mood Leibovitz created with most of her subjects
was one of ease, from the most inexperienced sitter to the most
savvy. When Hillary Clinton confessed that the White House's
sun-drenched balcony was one of the few places where she could seek
refuge, Leibovitz coaxed her into sitting at her desk there.
Stealthily, Leibovitz began to work, and before the first lady knew
it, the session was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``While doing these sessions, I didn't talk to the subjects
about pretending not to be there,'' Leibovitz says. ``I actually
talked about taking the picture, but tried not to put their lives
too far out of joint while photographing them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women'' also provided Leibovitz that rare opportunity to work
with what she diplomatically terms ``unprofessional sitters,''
otherwise known as camera-shy mortals. The Alabama miners were
quite giddy at the prospect of an Annie Leibovitz photo shoot.
``Frankly, the celebrity subjects became less and less interesting
as I went along,'' admits Leibovitz. ``More and more celebrities
bit the dust because I realized that this project could not have 20
actors and one schoolteacher.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting sessions for ``Women'' also occasioned wonderfully
unrehearsed moments of creativity. Wanting to capture newly buff
actress Sigourney Weaver in a slinky ``Cabaret'' style, Leibovitz
scheduled a massive two-day shoot. She ended up using the very
first Polaroid studies of Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has been completely enamored of Leibovitz's latest
effort. Some feel that in trying to depart from her usual style,
Leibovitz succumbed to mimicking a consortium of other
photographers' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Largely, the images we see are Annie Leibovitz copies of other
people's pictures,'' says Mary Panzer, curator of photographs at
the National Portrait Gallery. ``There is no organizing principle
behind this book other than that Annie Leibovitz has photographed
these women. As a viewer, I feel shortchanged, as I don't really
know what Annie Leibovitz really thinks about these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Leibovitz doesn't bridle at this criticism. She is the first to
admit that ``Women,'' while good, is flawed and that she could have
put in another year to iron out all its kinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize there are a variety of styles out there that I can't
help but be influenced by,'' says Leibovitz. ``But no matter how
much you are influenced by different photographers, you do end up
with your own look. Frankly, if there is any legitimate criticism
of my work, it is that I'm not hard-edged enough in my shots _ that
I'm a bit of a wimp. With `Women,' I'm trying to have a stronger
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   She will take issue with criticism that her celebrity actually
overshadows the actual subject matter, warping the final art. ``I
just don't see it getting in the way of the fundamental situation
of putting someone at ease and then just taking the picture,''
Leibovitz says, sounding more intrigued than irritated.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting ``Women'' has given Leibovitz the rare opportunity of
taking a reading of who is buying her book. She has been pleasantly
surprised by the number of male customers. ``Frankly, I was afraid
there might be nothing but girls in motorcycle jackets buying it,''
says Leibovitz. ``But I'm getting men buying books for their
mothers and sisters, wives and girlfriends. And I don't think
they're doing it just to score points.''
</P>
<P>
   She has also discovered that these photos, more than any others
in her illustrious catalog, have sparked an unexpected misty-eyed
response. ``Yesterday, a woman at a book signing just started
crying when talking about the battered-women photos,'' Leibovitz
says. ``The book seems to be a very emotional kind of breakthrough
for a lot of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, ``Women'' has gotten Leibovitz thinking about where she
would like her career to go next. ``Sure, I have mixed feelings
about what I'd like to do more of,'' she says. ``This book has the
more quiet work, the kind of nonconceptual things that my magazine
editors get nervous about. It's work that is very emotionally
moving to me. In the end, it's probably the best work I've ever
done.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be, but all the career fulfillment and accolades
showered on Leibovitz's recent work haven't shifted her priorities.
Scurrying to finish the interview, Leibovitz has to catch a plane
for her next assignment. It may be her year's most meaningful. It
will pay her zip. She is off to San Francisco to shoot her nephew's
bar mitzvah.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the southeastern corner of the great stone plaza
surrounding the two ancient mosques, a lone bulldozer methodically
scraped away a millennium's worth of dust and rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian and Israeli policemen stood guard tensely nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them, freshly exposed to the Jerusalem sun, two
long-buried arches formed a new vaulted entryway to a vast
subterranean chamber. It is a chamber that Christians associate
with the 12th-century Crusaders who were once encamped there, and
that some Jews say could abut unexcavated ruins of the Second
Temple, built by the last Jewish kingdom more than 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To the Muslim worshipers who fill the underground hall every
Friday during the holy month of Ramadan, the pillared chamber is
the seventh-century Marwani mosque, and its history and
architectural integrity are nobody's business but their own. The
Muslim clerics who are the custodians of the site angrily reject
demands by rightist Israeli politicians that they halt the digging
until Israeli archaeologists ascertain that they are not causing
archaeological damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't wait for permission from anybody,'' said Sheik
Muhammad Hussein, the director of the Haram al-Sharif mosque
complex, surveying the plaza from the desk of his Ottoman-era
office. ``This is an Islamic site.''
</P>
<P>
   In a project originally urged and authorized by the Israeli
police, the old arched walls were unearthed to provide an emergency
exit for the underground mosque. Only one narrow stairway led down
to the chamber, which was refurbished three years ago to handle
overflow crowds arriving to pray at the above-ground mosques here,
al-Aksa and the Dome of the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   This last Friday a record 400,000 worshipers filled the mosques
and the plaza. As many as a half million are expected for the final
Friday of Ramadan _ which, by coincidence, falls on New Year's Eve,
when thousands of Christians are expected to congregate in the
storied hillsides and ravines immediately outside the immense
plaza.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where theology and archaeology are explosively
entwined, it was inevitable that the excavation would not be seen
as a simple doorway project.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had work begun than Jerusalem's mayor, Israel's
attorney general, and the chief of the state antiquities commission
said it could endanger artifacts in the interior of the platform
that supported the Second Temple before the Romans knocked it down.
</P>
<P>
   Far-right Jewish protesters marched through the Old City streets
below, burning Palestinian flags and vowing one day to demolish the
mosques above. Prime Minister Ehud Barak convened a cabinet-level
review of the project. The archways would remain open, he ordered _
but not without trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about a very sensitive, volatile place, and one
must refrain from doing anything hasty that we will regret
afterwards,'' the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli courts have so far refused to issue a requested
injunction against the project _ to the relief of the Barak
administration, which does not want to impose its authority on
Muslim worshipers who have never recognized Israeli sovereignty in
Jerusalem's Old City. But Israeli television has kept the issue
alive, broadcasting scenes of Palestinian trucks hauling loads of
soil rich with pottery shards to a city dump.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Hussein professed to be unconcerned by the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay it no mind,'' he said, dismissing the debate with a wave
of his hand. ``This is just a lot of noise stirred up by the
Israelis for their own internal reasons. It is a fight between
Israeli factions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some respected Israeli archaeologists also say the controversy
is overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where they are digging is all late medieval landfill,'' said
Dan Bahat, a former chief government archaeologist for Jerusalem.
``If it were up to me, I would not have used bulldozers. But there
is nothing of value there. There is certainly nothing from the
Second Temple period. That is nonsense.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Built by Herod the Great in one of the biggest construction jobs
of the Roman era, the mammoth structure Muslims know as Haram
al-Sharif and Israelis call the Temple Mount is ground zero for
Jerusalem's religious wars. It is crowned by the mosques that are
the third holiest site in Islam, after Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Wall of the great stone platform is the single most
sacred place of worship for observant Jews. A blocked-off portal in
its eastern wall is the fabled Golden Door, believed by some
fundamentalist Christians to be the divinely designated entryway
for the Second Coming of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   To tamper physically with any of this is to play a highly
dangerous game of three-dimensional chess. In 1996, violent riots
followed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's authorization of the
opening of a tunnel along the platform's deeply buried base.
Fifty-four Palestinians and fourteen Israelis died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the tunnel,'' said Jamal Joulani, a leader of the
Islamic Boy Scouts, whose young troops supervise crowds here during
Ramadan. ``The Israelis just want to prove they have sovereignty
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Ehud Olmert, a right-wing opposition leader, emphatically
agrees. By permitting Muslims to excavate with no oversight by
state archaeologists, the Barak administration is undermining
Israel's legal and moral claim to this crucial piece of Jerusalem
real estate, he charged. With Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
just beginning to try to reconcile their mutually exclusive
territorial demands here, this is a politically potent accusation.
</P>
<P>
   When Israeli forces occupied the Old City of Jerusalem in the
1967 Middle East War, Moshe Dayan, their commander, promised that
Muslim leaders would retain administrative autonomy at Islamic holy
sites. The Waqf, an Islamic religious foundation that holds title
to the mosques, has overseen public works there ever since, without
ever formally recognizing Israel's authority.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Jerusalem Waqf answers to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority, but on a practical level, it acknowledges Israel's de
facto control. The Waqf bulldozer was beginning to clear away a
third archway when Barak reiterated his decision to permit the
opening of two portals, but only two. The work abruptly stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment the Waqf acted beyond the authorization that we
gave them, we informed it immediately that it had to seal that
which had been opened _ and so it was,'' said Haim Ramon, the
Israeli government minister for Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   For Bahat, this archaeological spat is literally wide of the
mark. Where Second Temple remains might be found, he said, is about
200 yards to the west of the archways, directly beneath al-Aksa
mosque. But excavation there is considered unthinkable for both
diplomatic and religious reasons, he concedes.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen if the Temple were found?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when politics is harnessed to
archaeology,'' Bahat said.

   SCYTHIAN TREASURES TO TOUR U.S. MUSEUMS
</P>
<P>
   For 400 years the Scythians, a tribe of nomadic horsemen, ruled
over the European steppe stretching from the Danube, east across
what is now Ukraine and into Russia, with their reign reaching its
height more than 2,500 years ago. Among the legacies of their
culture is some of the most accomplished gold artwork ever
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Some 170 of these artifacts from the Museum of Historical
Treasures of Ukraine-Kiev, the Institute of Archaeology of the
Academy of Sciences of Ukraine-Kiev and the State Historical
Archaeological Preserve-Pereiaslav may now be seen at the San
Antonio Museum of Art, where the exhibition ``Gold of the Nomads:
Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine'' will run through Jan. 30.
Over the next year, the objects will travel to the Walters Art
Gallery in Baltimore, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas
City, Mo., and the Grand Palais in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the lavish gold jewelry, vessels and weaponry, which
were found in burial mounds known as kurhans in Ukraine, were
commissioned by the Scythians from Greek workshops along the
northern coast of the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Among the objects on display are a gold helmet with combat
scenes depicted in relief, plaques decorated with images of winged
dragons, fourth-century Sphinx earrings, a fourth-century gold
headdress, swords, scabbards and daggers. Most of the objects were
only recently excavated and will be viewed for the first time
outside of Ukraine. These treasures probably represent only a
fraction of the Scythian legacy; experts say some 40,000 kurhans
await excavation.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Museum of Art, 200 West Jones Street, is open
Tuesday to Sunday. General admission is $5, $1.75 ages 4 to 11, $4
ages 65 and up and for students; admission to the Scythian
exhibition is an additional $5 a person regardless of age.
Information: (210) 978-8100.

<P>
   A BIGGER BEAUBOURG FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
</P>
<P>
   At 11 a.m. on Jan. 1, the Georges Pompidou Center (or Beaubourg,
as Parisians call the museum, after the street that runs behind it)
reopens its doors after more than two years of renovation. About
5,000 square feet of exhibition space have been added to France's
most significant modern art collection, along with an expanded
library, a rooftop restaurant, a cafe and boutique on the mezzanine
overlooking the lobby and a series of auditoriums on the lower
level for film screenings and dance, theater and music
performances.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring entrance hall on the Piazza, or Place Georges
Pompidou, the heart of the Pompidou Center and now its sole
entrance, is marked by a large awning (visitors will no longer have
free access to the roof terraces via the exterior escalator). The
heating and air-conditioning were updated, handicap access was
improved and 370 computer stations with Internet connections were
added in the library. Renovations of the lower level and ground and
first floors were designed by Renzo Piano, one of the museum's
original architects (the other was Richard Rogers). Originally
conceived to receive 5,000 visitors a day, the Pompidou Center was
attracting a daily attendance of 25,000 following its 1977 opening,
requiring numerous face lifts since. The most recent and most
extensive has cost $88 million.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth and fifth floors of the Pompidou Center will be
dedicated to the permanent collection, which includes works by
Braque, Picasso, Matisse, Kandinsky and Dubuffet. Nearly 1,500
works will be on view at one time (they will be rotated every 18
months to show the entire collection), compared with 800 before the
renovation. The redesigned and enlarged sixth floor will be set
aside for temporary exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Le Temps, Vite'' (Jan. 18 to April 10) will be the major
inaugural exhibition, with artwork in different mediums reflecting
the changing perception of time. Another inaugural exhibition,
``Jour de Fete'' (Jan. 1 to Feb. 28), will present the work of nine
contemporary French artists, including Marie-Ange Guilleminot,
Pierrick Sorin and Xavier Veilhan.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $4.75; $3.15 for students 18 and over and free for
those under 18, at 6.3 francs to dollar; between $4.75 and $7.95
for temporary exhibits (free for those under 13) and free for all
on the first Sunday of every month. The Center, at Place Georges
Pompidou in the fourth arrondissement, will be open Wednesday to
Monday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. (until 10 p.m. weekends). For information
see the Pompidou Center Web site, www.centrepompidou.fr, or call
(33-1) 44.78.12.33.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON MONUMENT CLOSES (ONCE AGAIN)
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Monument has closed for the third time during its
renovation and should reopen well before its completion goal of
July 4. In this last stage, the observation levels at 490 and 500
feet will be refurbished, and the elevator cab upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   Since the renovation began two years ago, 36,000 exterior stones
have been inspected on the 555-foot obelisk, with 78 of them having
to be repaired. In addition, 62,304 linear feet of joints were
repointed, and its entire surface (94,060 square feet) was cleaned.
A lot of dirt had accumulated since the last cleaning, in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Once the cleaning is finished, the scaffolding system designed
by the architect Michael Graves will be removed, and the monument's
surface will be visible again.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will be happy when that happens. The scaffolding,
which is covered by a fabric that mimics the design of the stones,
turned out to be a popular attraction, especially at night when
lights make the monument look like a beacon.
</P>

   UNITED EXPANDS FLIGHTS FROM THE WEST COAST
</P>
<P>
   Since designating Los Angeles International Airport as a hub
last spring, United Airlines has been steadily expanding its West
Coast operations. In September the airline inaugurated direct
nonstop service between Sacramento and Washington and between Los
Angeles and Dallas, Houston and Atlanta. In addition, service from
Los Angeles to Miami and Orlando and from San Jose to Washington
was expanded. At the end of October shuttle service using 737s was
introduced from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara, Palm Springs and San
Diego, and _ outside the state _ to Reno and Medford, in southwest
Oregon. There are two round-trip shuttles to Medford every day,
three to Reno, four to Santa Barbara and Palm Springs, and seven to
San Diego.  &QL;

   A TRAIN CALLED BETSY DEBUTS IN BANGKOK
</P>
<P>
   Since Dec. 5, Bangkok's visitors and commuters have been
traveling faster along busy Sukhumvit and Silom Roads aboard the
Bangkok Elevated Train System, officially called the Skytrain and
unofficially dubbed Betsy.
</P>
<P>
   The 14.6-mile electric train line serves many hotels, such as
the Dusit Thani and Oriental, and several shopping centers, with a
central station at Siam Square. It extends far along Sukhumvit Road
past the Ekamai bus terminal, and in the other direction past
Victory Monument as far as the Chatuchak weekend market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The elevated trains run 6 a.m. to midnight, with an expected
650,000 passengers daily. The trains will initially be three cars,
with 126 seats each, expanding to six cars as demand grows. Fares
are 10 to 40 baht (about 40 cents to $1, at 38.55 baht to $1),
depending on distance traveled. Tickets are sold at ticket counters
and vending machines at stations.
</P>
<P>
   The Skytrain is so far the most successful of three mass transit
projects planned for Bangkok, the other two being the financially
troubled Hopewell elevated train and highway system and a subway
due for completion in about two years. The Skytrain has had its own
troubles, including protests from those in wheelchairs about the
lack of elevators, a matter unresolved. Bangkok's governor, Bhichit
Rattakul, has promised 11 elevators to serve at least five main
stations in the 23-station network. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was light when the system made its debut Dec. 5 because
it was the 72nd birthday of Thailand's beloved monarch, King
Bhumibol Adulyadej, a national holiday. The elevated train posed
one protocol puzzle: would trains stop, as does everything and
everyone else in Thailand, when a royal motorcade passes by, or
even underneath?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talked about this matter with the Secretarial Royal
Palace,'' a spokesperson for the transit system replied. ``The
palace allows the Skytrain to run normally with no stop on this
regard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Skytrain has an Internet site, with route map, fare finder
and links to maps of individual stations: www.bts.co.th/mapeng.htm.

 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Star of Bethlehem has been called many things by many
people: a comet, a conjunction of planets, a supernova, a miracle,
a myth. With just one biblical account, in the book of Matthew, of
the star and how it caused the wise men to come to Judea in search
of the newborn Jesus, exactly what it was, if it was anything at
all, remains an open question.
</P>
<P>
   That question has attracted yet another answer, one that is
gaining attention from historians of astronomy for its unusual
approach. Dr. Michael R. Molnar, an astronomer and physicist and
former teacher at Rutgers University, proposes that the star was
the planet Jupiter, seen in the constellation Aries the ram.
</P>
<P>
   Molnar even offers a date for its appearance: April 17, 6 B.C.
On that day, he argues in a new book, ``The Star of Bethlehem: The
Legacy of the Magi'' (Rutgers University Press), Jupiter reappeared
as a morning star (after days when it rose, invisibly, only during
daylight hours) and was also hidden briefly by the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jupiter was considered to be the regal star or regal planet,''
Molnar said in an interview. Thus the two events on the same day
would have been looked upon by the wise men, or magi, who were
astrologers, as strong portents of the birth of a great king. The
fact that Jupiter appeared in Aries, in the east, had further
significance, Molnar said, as Aries was considered the symbol of
Judea.
</P>
<P>
   Molnar studied many ancient astrological texts, including the
Tetrabiblos of Ptolemy from the second century A.D., to try to
understand how astrologers of the time would have interpreted
events in the sky. When looked at in this way, other theories about
the star are easily refuted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supernovas, for instance, are exciting events but were virtually
ignored by astrologers, not considered omens of anything. A comet
was an omen for bad, not good _ for war or civil unrest or death,
not for the birth of a king. It is the reliance on an ancient view
of things that has earned Molnar's book praise from some historians
of astronomy, including Dr. Owen Gingerich, a professor of
astronomy and the history of science at the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the few works on this subject that is
historically sensitive to the era,'' Gingerich said. ``He's not
just trying to think from modern terms of how we'd look for a star
in the sky. He's painted a very plausible historical picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Molnar pored over numerous old texts and star charts to come to
his conclusions. But he first began formulating his idea while
looking at something else: a Roman coin. That coin, which Molnar
bought for $50 at a New York show for his collection, was minted in
Syria around A.D. 6. It showed Aries looking back over his shoulder
at a star. ``I thought, `Why did these people put Aries the ram on
there?''' he said. The Romans, he learned, annexed Judea in A.D. 6,
and Aries first appeared on Roman coins in that year. That told him
that Aries was a symbol for Judea, a fact confirmed by reading
Ptolemy.
</P>
<P>
   While stars occur often on Roman coins, the star on this coin,
combined with the symbolism of the ram, got him thinking that
something happened in Aries related to Judea. From there it was a
question of conducting research until he found out what that
something could have been.
</P>
<P>
   His date for the star's appearance is consistent with many
scholarly estimates of the year of Jesus' birth. It is generally
accepted that Jesus was born within two years of the death of the
Judean King Herod, which has commonly been put at 4 B.C. But that
date has been called into question in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Finegan, an emeritus professor at the Pacific School of
Religion in Berkeley, Calif., and author of ``The Handbook of
Biblical Chronology,'' a standard reference on the subject, now
puts Herod's death more likely at 1 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   John Mosley, program director at the Griffith Observatory in Los
Angeles and an expert on the Star of Bethlehem, said that while it
may never be possible to know what the star was, ``when Herod died
was an actual event and should be knowable.'' If Herod died in 1
B.C., he added, ``you can't stretch the birth of Jesus back to 6 or
7 B.C.''
</P>
<P>
   From a religious perspective, such questions of timing may not
matter, said Dr. Alan Altany, an associate professor of religion at
Marshall University in Huntington, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of biblical scholars would say that the truth of the
story is not dependent on whether there was a star,'' Altany said.
The book of Matthew was written some 50 years after the death of
Jesus, Altany said, and the writer may have been using a star
symbolically. ``Whenever a ruler was born, there usually was a star
connected with his birth,'' he said. By including a star in his
account, the writer of Matthew was ``putting Jesus up there with
the other heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Molnar realizes as well that at some point, any discussion of
what the star might have been, particularly one that sets a
specific date, involves an act of faith. ``I cannot prove that
Jesus was born at that time,'' he said. ``The evidence is there for
other people to judge for themselves.''

   SCYTHIAN TREASURES TO TOUR U.S. MUSEUMS
</P>
<P>
   For 400 years the Scythians, a tribe of nomadic horsemen, ruled
over the European steppe stretching from the Danube, east across
what is now Ukraine and into Russia, with their reign reaching its
height more than 2,500 years ago. Among the legacies of their
culture is some of the most accomplished gold artwork ever
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Some 170 of these artifacts from the Museum of Historical
Treasures of Ukraine-Kiev, the Institute of Archaeology of the
Academy of Sciences of Ukraine-Kiev and the State Historical
Archaeological Preserve-Pereiaslav may now be seen at the San
Antonio Museum of Art, where the exhibition ``Gold of the Nomads:
Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine'' will run through Jan. 30.
Over the next year, the objects will travel to the Walters Art
Gallery in Baltimore, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas
City, Mo., and the Grand Palais in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the lavish gold jewelry, vessels and weaponry, which
were found in burial mounds known as kurhans in Ukraine, were
commissioned by the Scythians from Greek workshops along the
northern coast of the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Among the objects on display are a gold helmet with combat
scenes depicted in relief, plaques decorated with images of winged
dragons, fourth-century Sphinx earrings, a fourth-century gold
headdress, swords, scabbards and daggers. Most of the objects were
only recently excavated and will be viewed for the first time
outside of Ukraine. These treasures probably represent only a
fraction of the Scythian legacy; experts say some 40,000 kurhans
await excavation.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Museum of Art, 200 West Jones Street, is open
Tuesday to Sunday. General admission is $5, $1.75 ages 4 to 11, $4
ages 65 and up and for students; admission to the Scythian
exhibition is an additional $5 a person regardless of age.
Information: (210) 978-8100.
</P>
<P>
   A BIGGER BEAUBOURG FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
</P>
<P>
   At 11 a.m. on Jan. 1, the Georges Pompidou Center (or Beaubourg,
as Parisians call the museum, after the street that runs behind it)
reopens its doors after more than two years of renovation. About
5,000 square feet of exhibition space have been added to France's
most significant modern art collection, along with an expanded
library, a rooftop restaurant, a cafe and boutique on the mezzanine
overlooking the lobby and a series of auditoriums on the lower
level for film screenings and dance, theater and music
performances.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring entrance hall on the Piazza, or Place Georges
Pompidou, the heart of the Pompidou Center and now its sole
entrance, is marked by a large awning (visitors will no longer have
free access to the roof terraces via the exterior escalator). The
heating and air-conditioning were updated, handicap access was
improved and 370 computer stations with Internet connections were
added in the library. Renovations of the lower level and ground and
first floors were designed by Renzo Piano, one of the museum's
original architects (the other was Richard Rogers). Originally
conceived to receive 5,000 visitors a day, the Pompidou Center was
attracting a daily attendance of 25,000 following its 1977 opening,
requiring numerous face lifts since. The most recent and most
extensive has cost $88 million.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth and fifth floors of the Pompidou Center will be
dedicated to the permanent collection, which includes works by
Braque, Picasso, Matisse, Kandinsky and Dubuffet. Nearly 1,500
works will be on view at one time (they will be rotated every 18
months to show the entire collection), compared with 800 before the
renovation. The redesigned and enlarged sixth floor will be set
aside for temporary exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Le Temps, Vite'' (Jan. 18 to April 10) will be the major
inaugural exhibition, with artwork in different mediums reflecting
the changing perception of time. Another inaugural exhibition,
``Jour de Fete'' (Jan. 1 to Feb. 28), will present the work of nine
contemporary French artists, including Marie-Ange Guilleminot,
Pierrick Sorin and Xavier Veilhan.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $4.75; $3.15 for students 18 and over and free for
those under 18, at 6.3 francs to dollar; between $4.75 and $7.95
for temporary exhibits (free for those under 13) and free for all
on the first Sunday of every month. The Center, at Place Georges
Pompidou in the fourth arrondissement, will be open Wednesday to
Monday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. (until 10 p.m. weekends). For information
see the Pompidou Center Web site, www.centrepompidou.fr, or call
(33-1) 44.78.12.33.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON MONUMENT CLOSES (ONCE AGAIN)
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Monument has closed for the third time during its
renovation and should reopen well before its completion goal of
July 4. In this last stage, the observation levels at 490 and 500
feet will be refurbished, and the elevator cab upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   Since the renovation began two years ago, 36,000 exterior stones
have been inspected on the 555-foot obelisk, with 78 of them having
to be repaired. In addition, 62,304 linear feet of joints were
repointed, and its entire surface (94,060 square feet) was cleaned.
A lot of dirt had accumulated since the last cleaning, in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Once the cleaning is finished, the scaffolding system designed
by the architect Michael Graves will be removed, and the monument's
surface will be visible again.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will be happy when that happens. The scaffolding,
which is covered by a fabric that mimics the design of the stones,
turned out to be a popular attraction, especially at night when
lights make the monument look like a beacon.
</P>
<P>
   UNITED EXPANDS FLIGHTS FROM THE WEST COAST
</P>
<P>
   Since designating Los Angeles International Airport as a hub
last spring, United Airlines has been steadily expanding its West
Coast operations. In September the airline inaugurated direct
nonstop service between Sacramento and Washington and between Los
Angeles and Dallas, Houston and Atlanta. In addition, service from
Los Angeles to Miami and Orlando and from San Jose to Washington
was expanded. At the end of October shuttle service using 737s was
introduced from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara, Palm Springs and San
Diego, and _ outside the state _ to Reno and Medford, in southwest
Oregon. There are two round-trip shuttles to Medford every day,
three to Reno, four to Santa Barbara and Palm Springs, and seven to
San Diego.  &QL;

   A TRAIN CALLED BETSY DEBUTS IN BANGKOK
</P>
<P>
   Since Dec. 5, Bangkok's visitors and commuters have been
traveling faster along busy Sukhumvit and Silom Roads aboard the
Bangkok Elevated Train System, officially called the Skytrain and
unofficially dubbed Betsy.
</P>
<P>
   The 14.6-mile electric train line serves many hotels, such as
the Dusit Thani and Oriental, and several shopping centers, with a
central station at Siam Square. It extends far along Sukhumvit Road
past the Ekamai bus terminal, and in the other direction past
Victory Monument as far as the Chatuchak weekend market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The elevated trains run 6 a.m. to midnight, with an expected
650,000 passengers daily. The trains will initially be three cars,
with 126 seats each, expanding to six cars as demand grows. Fares
are 10 to 40 baht (about 40 cents to $1, at 38.55 baht to $1),
depending on distance traveled. Tickets are sold at ticket counters
and vending machines at stations.
</P>
<P>
   The Skytrain is so far the most successful of three mass transit
projects planned for Bangkok, the other two being the financially
troubled Hopewell elevated train and highway system and a subway
due for completion in about two years. The Skytrain has had its own
troubles, including protests from those in wheelchairs about the
lack of elevators, a matter unresolved. Bangkok's governor, Bhichit
Rattakul, has promised 11 elevators to serve at least five main
stations in the 23-station network. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was light when the system made its debut Dec. 5 because
it was the 72nd birthday of Thailand's beloved monarch, King
Bhumibol Adulyadej, a national holiday. The elevated train posed
one protocol puzzle: would trains stop, as does everything and
everyone else in Thailand, when a royal motorcade passes by, or
even underneath?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talked about this matter with the Secretarial Royal
Palace,'' a spokesperson for the transit system replied. ``The
palace allows the Skytrain to run normally with no stop on this
regard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Skytrain has an Internet site, with route map, fare finder
and links to maps of individual stations:
www.bts.co.th/map_eng.htm.

 &HT;    'PORK' LIST SHOWS PATH OF POWER
 &HT;    Eds: Bullet items at end could run as graphic element.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional appropriators decided ``who was
naughty and who was nice enough'' for federal grants, according to
a report Monday that identifies 1,348 pet projects in the recently
passed federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., issued the ``Year 2000 Pork List'' of
earmarked projects that, he charged, have distorted the spending
process and funneled dollars into the states of the most powerful
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska was a big winner in the listing. The sparsely settled
state would receive $125 per capita in specially designated federal
grants. Alaska's senior senator, Ted Stevens, is a Republican who
chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia, which ranks 35th among the states in population,
was among the top 10 in winning federal grants, averaging $33.60
per person. That state has the top-ranking Democrat, Robert C.
Byrd, on the appropriating panel.
</P>
<P>
   Other big winners were Mississippi, home of Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, a Republican. His state averaged $11.60 per
person. Alabama garnered $11 per person in earmarked projects and
Kentucky about $10.75.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, California's lawmakers obtained more total grants,
but the spending for that most populous state averages only about
$3.40. The per capita ``pork'' spending for Texas is only about
$1.40.
</P>
<P>
   So-called ``losers'' also include Georgia, averaging $2.15 per
person, North Carolina at $2.30, and Ohio at $2.05.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn's ``Year 2000 Pork List'' is taken from the $617 billion
that Congress recently approved for so-called discretionary
government spending, excluding programs such as Social Security,
Medicare and other mandatory spending.
</P>
<P>
   His office found that the number of projects ``earmarked'' by
lawmakers for their home districts had doubled since last year for
the Labor-Health and Human Services legislation, which has long
been considered prime pork territory.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of seeking special interest funding ``creates at
least the appearance of corruption,'' Coburn said. ``Some
politicians think they prove their worth by bringing home the bacon
to their constituents. The expected reward for doing so is support
in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, earmarking creates the appearance that incumbent
politicians are using public funds to help our their own
re-election. It may not be illegal, but this is the sort of thing
the old-time bosses meant by 'honest graft.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Coburn is far less harsh in his criticism than Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, the Republican presidential candidate who
has cited more than $14.6 billion in pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn's definition of pork is much narrower, limited to grants
that are clearly designated for particular recipients. His pork
list totals only about $1.5 billion. And he does not include
billions of dollars in military programs and weaponry that Congress
has required the Pentagon to spend, often to the benefit of their
home states.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of this kind of spending, including Stevens and Byrd,
have defended it as evidence of working hard for constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn argues that the job of Congress is to approve the general
outlines of programs, not to designate the details of the spending.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 1,348 items on his ``pork'' list:
</P>
<P>
   _ A package of $50,000 grants for computer aid for 20 school
systems in the district of Rep. Bob Riley, R-Ala. His spokesman
Pepper Bryars, said the schools needed special assistance, since
they are among the lowest in the nation in use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ $400,000 for construction in Springfield, Mass., of a national
memorial park honoring the late children's author Theodore Geisel,
known as Dr. Seuss.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1.2 million to renovate a gateway to historic downtown
Madison, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   _ $500,000 for development of a new facility for the Harriet
Tubman African American Museum in Macon, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   _ $200,000 to buy land for the Tool Town precision metal working
park in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   _ $800,000 for technology for community policing in Austin,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   _ $4 million to develop a ski area for the Special Olympics in
Anchorage, Alaska.

 CAN SPRING BE FAR AWAY?  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I saw the first robin of the winter season this
weekend, bob-bob-bobbing along, all fat and sassy. Its arrival is
so premature I longed to buy it a wool muffler. When I was growing
up in the Midwest, it was a major event to spot the first robin,
whose appearance sometime in April meant spring was coming at last.
</P>
<P>
   Now this unexpected holiday presence seems a good omen not just
for continued mild weather but for happy times in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Some places will still have a white Christmas, but we here on
the East Coast head
</P>
<P>
   toward a fresh year with temperatures so balmy that the trees
and plants are as impatient for spring as the birds. In New York,
200 miles north of here, snowdrop bulb shoots are up and forsythia
is in bloom. Here in the nation's capital, the boldest trees
suddenly have that lime-colored feathery look that signifies infant
leaves aborning.
</P>
<P>
   Federal scientists say that in the contiguous 48 states 1999
will go down as one of the warmest years on record and the trend is
likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
   We are indeed a warm and contented nation these days, both
physically and emotionally. We are in a far better mood than last
year at this time. What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19, 1998, the House of Representatives impeached
President Clinton for lying and assorted sins stemming from his
illicit affair with a White House intern. We were tormented by
disgust and divided by partisan rancor. Things were ugly. The
government was immobilized.
</P>
<P>
   The first momentous act of this year was the Senate acquittal of
the president, keeping him in office and avoiding the inevitable
chaos of a transfer of power that an overwhelming majority of
voters told pollsters they opposed. (To this day, 57 percent of
those surveyed still say the Senate action was correct, down 11
percentage points from the number who felt that way during the
trial but still a clear majority.) The acquittal did not wipe out
the stigma Clinton will forever bear of becoming the first elected
president to be impeached, but it did quiet the political uproar.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Congress put up a facade of working
together, but tempers did not cool sufficiently for any major
legislative achievement. It will not be possible next year either
in the midst of the 2000 presidential campaign. We need a breather.
We need another voter referendum to demonstrate the popular will.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, that ``family
values'' champion recently discovered to have been a six-year
adulterer, and his almost-successor Rep. Bob Livingston, who quit
the House to avoid exposure of his own infidelity, took some of the
partisan sting out of Clinton's misbehavior. Republicans can be
scoundrels too. The GOP no longer has a political lock on moral
values.
</P>
<P>
   But as a country we are still uneasy about our ethical standards
_ or lack of them.
</P>
<P>
   For all their moralizing, politicians do not have the answers.
Instead, religious values have taken on new political importance.
</P>
<P>
   Violence, particularly in the schools, is deeply troubling.
Something in our culture needs fixing, and there is no consensus to
point the way. We will have to deal with it in the next century. A
democracy is a work in progress. There is always unfinished
business _ in education, in retirement security, in abusive
campaign practices.
</P>
<P>
   The key to our present overall satisfaction is peace and
prosperity, the two traditional pillars of political stability. We
are in an unprecedented period of economic growth, spread unevenly
but widely enough to touch most of us. American soldiers are not
dying on foreign soil in some dimly understood cause. There are
wars around the globe, but we are basically keeping our military
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Since welfare reform, the rolls have been cut in half. The
violent crime rate has also dropped dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 presidential campaign is already down to two
Republicans and two Democrats, all qualified, substantive men. No
matter which one wins, the republic will be in safe hands. (I'm
ignoring the Reform Party, which is a joke and hasn't a chance
anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the issues is sometimes heavy going, more for
policy wonks than ordinary folk, but it may be useful to the future
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good time to be alive and an American. It may not yet be
springtime in this country, but the turn of the century is a
wonderful moment for robins.

   &UR; THE LAW SHE IS A TRICKY DEVIL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Civil Justice Association of California _ formerly, &LR;  the
Association for California Tort Reform, seemingly an anti-litigant
group _ has named California's Most Outrageous Lawsuits of the
Decade. Three pick hits:
</P>
<P>
   - A case in which a man sued beer vendors in a baseball stadium
for emotional distress incurred when he saw women using a men's
room during a rock concert. He blamed the beer vendor for sending
him on numerous trips to the rest room.
</P>
<P>
   - A case where a bank robber sued a bank, the police and a
California city, &LR;  after he got away from the bank with marked money
containing a tear gas device that caused him burns when he stuffed
it into his pants.
</P>
<P>
   - An Orange County city was sued for not maintaining its
property when an 11-year-old ran over his finger while
skateboarding.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Long live love: A San Francisco city employee, given a
sick-pay transfer form to donate hours to a colleague in need, was
fascinated by the form's Marital Status Declaration, an
encapsulation of the state of modern romance:
</P>
<P>
   Either the donor is married, in which case the donor's spouse
has to approve the gift, or 1) ``I am not married.'' 2) ``I do not
know, and I have taken all reasonable steps to determine, the
whereabouts of my current spouse.'' 3) ``I and my current spouse
have executed a marriage settlement agreement pursuant to Title II
of Part 5 of Division 4 of the California Civil Code (or a
predecessor statute, if applicable) which makes my earnings my
separate property.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Jodie Foster  &LR; is fighting with CBS over a $12,000 hair and
makeup bill incurred in preparation for her appearance on ``60
Minutes II'' last week, &LR;  to promote ``Anna and the King.'' The New
York Post says that NBC settled with Foster by sharing the costs of
her hair and makeup with the movie's studio.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Barbara  &LR; and  &UR; Dennis Kavanagh &LR;  of Mill Valley, sailing
through the Panama Canal alongside a vessel filled with crew
members for the movie ``The Perfect Storm,'' came face to face (bow
to bow) with the WWII battleship New Jersey. As the 57-year-old
ship passed, all hands on the two boats going in the other
direction saluted.
</P>
<P>
   - Organizers of the Miss America pageant are thinking about
moving the contest from September to October so as not to compete
for television viewers with the Olympics, which will be broadcast
from Australia between September 15 and October 1.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Muhammad Ali &LR;  will ring the opening bell at the New York
Stock Exchange on December 31.
</P>
<P>
   - Emcee  &UR; Jan Wahl &LR;  proclaimed  &UR; Tom Ammiano  &LR; ``Mayor of the
Emerald City'' last week, &LR;  when the defeated candidate escorted
 &UR; Lorna Luft &LR;  down the aisle of the Castro Theatre er  &LR; at  &UR; Marc &LR; 
 &UR; Huestis &LR; ' ``A  &UR; Judy Garland &LR;  Christmas.'' Luft, Garland's daughter,
revealed that  &UR; Judy Davis  &LR; will play her mother in a made-for-TV
movie based on her book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOMAGE TO A FRIEND &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pat Steger &LR; , The Chronicle's late social columnist, is to be
remembered with a circle of tiles in Pioneer Park, at the base of
Coit Tower.
</P>
<P>
   The Pat Steger circle will be located near an already existing
 &UR; Herb Caen &LR;  circle. Neighborhood preservationists have been raising
money for park restoration by selling tiles marked with donors'

CARROLL, FACING PRESS, TALKS OF RESETTING GOALS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Pete Carroll was sullen and humble Monday as
he faced the media horde for the first time since learning he would
not be going to the playoffs for the first time in his tenure with
the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke about winning the remaining two games and challenged
his players when he said, ``I'll take those who want to go with me.
It's very important that we need to reset our goals. We need to be
winners. We'll play guys that feel the same. This is a new time for
us since we've been here, since we've not been in a situation where
the playoffs weren't at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his players rewatch the film and never called any of
them quitters, but he certainly implied that some played harder
than others. He said he was not ready to throw in the towel and
play Michael Bishop or certain other rookies. He felt very strongly
about ending the season on a winning note, and he's curious how his
team will respond to the knowledge that they're playing for pride.
</P>
<P>
   The players came and went without much to say.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Jefferson was still quite upset about missing the playoffs
for the first time as a member of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't go out last night,'' said Jefferson. ``My wife is a
Lakers fan, and we were going to go to the (Celtics) game, but I'd
be embarrassed to show my face in public after a game like that. I
didn't even go out to eat. My wife asked me if I took this all too
personally, and I said to her, `This is how I am, and this is how I
respond to losing, especially losing like this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he didn't see Larry Whigham celebrating after his
blocked punt, but the coach came down on Whigham Monday after
watching the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't sit with me,'' said Carroll. ``That's one of
those plays that it has to be your mindset that you finish the
play. It was a bad mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   After Whigham met with Carroll, he admitted his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just very enthusiastic, but I learned something from
that play,'' said Whigham. ``You have to finish plays, and I'll do
that from now on.'' Asked if he could have made the subsequent
tackle considering the play was well away from him, ``I'm not sure,
but given a great effort, you never know what can happen,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whigham also believes the players will ride Carroll's coattails
toward a strong finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing the competitive nature of this team, I know they'll
want to win the next two games more than anything to save
something,'' said Whigham.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson said Carroll warned them to stay focused against the
Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many times he warned us about Philadelphia,''
he said. ``He told us that we had to be at the top of our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Whigham, ``I think there was an acceptance of what was
going on. I'm not saying anybody quit, but everyone accepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither player believes the Patriots need to start from scratch.
They both think minor tweaks will produce a very good team next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking from a personal viewpoint, I don't think it's a
matter of rebuilding,'' said Whigham. ``I just think it's a matter
of guys getting their heads out of their behinds. From an owner's
perspective, he looks at trying to get better every year, so I'm
not sure how he feels about the situation. He pays a lot of money
to the guys to go out and win games, and we haven't been doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll continued to defend offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese,
who will surely take the fall along with the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have strong feelings about Ernie,'' said Carroll. ``In
Monday's game, we had plenty of shots, or we didn't throw the ball
where we should have. Ernie can't catch the ball for them, but he
gave them a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in these tough times that veterans have to step up and
take control. And that's precisely what Terry Allen (two fumbles)
did not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really disappointed,'' said Carroll. ``Putting the ball
on the ground two times. We had to sit him down and challenge him
and get him back out there. He didn't run the ball that well after
that, but Terry is one of the guys I've depended on as an
experienced guy in a tough situation who can handle it. He has been
that. But we didn't need that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got away with his first fumble. On the second one, Heath
Irwin was trying to make a block and hit the ball with his foot.
He's an experienced guy who's been here before. He responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll believed there should have been more of a tempo of
urgency in his players as they strolled to the line of scrimmage
late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a case of not trying or being
disinterested,'' said Carroll. ``That's a rhythm dictated by the
quarterback. I wished it wasn't an issue. I think the urgency was
there. Yeah, it could have been done faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his personal situation, Carroll said firmly, ``What
you can expect is, I'll stay on course with how I've been. I'm
gonna do everything we can and think of everything I can think of
to get us back on track. It's important to win this game. Anything
that distracts me, I'd be letting our guys down.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is pained by the slide in his record since taking over
for Bill Parcells _ from 10-6 (second round of the playoffs_ to 9-7
(first round of the playoffs) to 7-7 (out of the playoffs).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real disappointed,'' said Carroll. ``It looks like we're
sliding. You like to think you're getting better. It's
disappointing because we've had our guys available to us. We have
to get what we can out of it and make it a winning season.''

 FRIENDS RALLY SUPPORT FOR LOS ALAMOS SCIENTIST  (jw) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ Jean Marshall has lived next door to Wen Ho
Lee for nearly two decades. They raised their children together in
a neighborhood of modest homes, just around the corner from Pinon
Elementary School and its playground.
</P>
<P>
   In this middle-class town of soccer moms and hydrogen bombs,
they were more than neighbors. Mrs. Marshall develops computer
codes for the X Division of the nuclear weapons lab here, where Dr.
Lee also worked before he was fired in March for security
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after Dr. Lee was indicted on 59 counts of
mishandling atomic secrets, Mrs. Marshall traveled with her husband
down a winding mountain road to Albuquerque and testified on Dr.
Lee's behalf before in crowded federal courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Marshall portrayed Dr. Lee as a devoted father, a kind
neighbor and a compassionate man. When federal agents began
monitoring his movements around the clock, she said, he told her he
did not mind when they followed him to his favorite fishing spots,
because it gave them much-needed breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never fails to come out and chat,'' Mrs. Marshall said.
``He always brightens my day.''
</P>
<P>
   She dismissed the idea that Dr. Lee, an American scientist of
Taiwanese birth, might flee the country if released on bail, and
frowned as the judge ordered him held behind bars pending trial,
which might be as much as a year away. At worst, his alleged
wrongdoings are punishable by life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   A chill has descended on Los Alamos and its suburb White Rock, a
mountaintop community of 18,000 people whose lives revolve around
the weapons lab, the birthplace of the bomb and the main guardian
of the nation's nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee was arrested on Dec. 10 at his home in White Rock after
nearly five years of federal investigations concerning Chinese
atomic espionage. Whether he is innocent or guilty of mishandling
secret data, many people here expressed shock at the implication _
for which there is no formal charge _ that he was a spy. A few,
like Mrs. Marshall, are speaking out in support of Dr. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have worked with him or know him and his family
almost uniformly say he could not have been a spy,'' Dr. Ralph R.
Stevens, a scientist at the weapons lab, said in an interview after
going to Albuquerque as part of a crowd of Lee supporters. He said
his four children had grown up with the Lee children, playing and
studying together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears he has violated security rules, and that is a very
serious offense,'' Dr. Stevens said. ``But the way that the whole
situation was handled, there's been character assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's a very unhappy situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say that Dr. Lee in 1993, 1994 and 1997
downloaded from lab computers a trove of weapons secrets onto 10
tapes, and that 7 of them are missing. If they fell into enemy
hands, they could be extremely dangerous to American security.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee has admitted downloading some data, but he has said he
did so for innocent reasons. His lawyers say that the missing tapes
were destroyed. Whatever the truth, the case has thrown into
turmoil the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which meanders over
more than 43 square miles of mesas and canyons here.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerry B. Wilhelmy, a senior scientist, told a public forum
last Tuesday that foreigners were starting to shun the weapons lab,
both as a place to visit or to work, threatening to isolate its
10,000 experts from the global scientific community. ``They'll say,
`It's a scary place. They're putting people away for life for
making some security mistake,' '' Dr. Wilhelmy said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen M. Younger, head of the nuclear weapons program at
the lab, told the federal court that Dr. Lee's downloading of
weapon secrets was extremely unusual. American officials have good
reason to be wary, he said. ``The country has given us a sacred
trust to protect this information and we are concerned that this
trust may have been violated,'' he said. ``That worries us a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning nearly five years ago, Dr. Lee became a focus of
federal suspicion after intelligence analysts here found clues that
China had stolen top American nuclear secrets, including the design
of the W-88, the nation's most modern warhead. The analysts
reasoned that the theft of the W-88 material took place between
1984 and 1988 _ long before Dr. Lee began the downloading he has
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee was never charged with spying and denied all wrongdoing
but was fired from Los Alamos in March for security violations
centering on his computer usage and failure to report foreign
contacts.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, federal investigators said they had erred in focusing
too narrowly on Los Alamos and Dr. Lee, and vowed to redo the
inquiry, with some Justice Department officials reportedly arguing
that the espionage case against him was too weak to prosecute. But
on Dec. 10, Dr. Lee was arrested and charged in U.S. District Court
in Albuquerque with security violations. A bail hearing was held
Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
   There, federal prosecutors said Dr. Lee had downloaded vast
amounts of data from classified to unclassified parts of lab's
computer network, and then loaded the cache onto portable computer
tapes. Investigators said they could find no similar actions among
lab workers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robert Messemer, an FBI agent, said the scientist was also a
flight risk. After being notified in the early 1990s that he might
be laid off from Los Alamos, Dr. Lee, he said, had sought jobs in
Switzerland, Germany, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee's lawyers, Mark Holscher of Los Angeles and John Cline
of Albuquerque, argued that the defendant was a loyal American who
had done nothing untoward. The downloading, Holscher said, was not
selective and sinister. He said it included large amounts of
unclassified data mixed in with the weapons secrets. He suggested
that other lab employees did likewise when they failed to put
secret materials back into safes.
</P>
<P>
   Holscher repeatedly asked Messemer if the government had any
evidence that the missing data had ever left Los Alamos, or had
fallen into unfriendly hands. None was offered.
</P>
<P>
   The missing tapes, Holscher said, had been destroyed, but he
offered no details of when, where or by whom, or any evidence to
back up the claim of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The judge nonetheless ruled that Dr. Lee's potential access to
the missing secrets was a ``clear and present danger to the United
States.'' He ordered that the scientist remain in custody awaiting
trial, which defense lawyers said might be a year or more away.
</P>
<P>
   After Dr. Lee was led away, a group of Los Alamos neighbors
crowded around his wife, Sylvia, and his daughter, Alberta, hugging
them and showering them with dinner invitations and other offers of
support. Outside the courtroom, Cecilia Chang, a friend of the Lee
family, who is organizing a legal defense fund, said that Dr. Lee
was the victim of selective prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of cars go over 60 miles per hour,'' she said, ``but this
is like ticketing just one because the driver had a Chinese face.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ms. Chang announced that a support group for the jailed
man had been formed in New Mexico. ``It is clear to many of us in
New Mexico that Wen Ho Lee is a victim of hysteria and political
vengeance,'' the group's head, Patricia Wolff of Santa Fe, said in
a statement. ``We will not stand idly by while the government
scapegoats and sacrifices Dr. Lee on the altar of nuclear weapons
secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Schwartz, publisher of the Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists, a leading nuclear journal, said that ``many other
scientists at Los Alamos and elsewhere had routinely violated those
regulations,'' and that if Dr. Lee had been charged with a
downloading crime ``they'd probably have to go out and cite several
hundred other people at Los Alamos for the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays there is a lot of this kind of talk around the lab. One
Los Alamos expert said with a shrug that he knew of at least two
people who had admitted to Dr. Lee's type of downloading.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Lee's defenders seem likely to have a hard time proving
that the crime is widespread, since public admissions of wrongdoing
in theory could land a lab worker in jail. People at the lab,
speaking guardedly, said it was not unusual for their colleagues to
download secret data to unsecure computers. But none could
substantiate claims that the practice was common. And when pressed
in interviews, they became skittish and changed the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's other people who know more,'' said Henry Fisher, a
retired Los Alamos computer expert. But he declined to discuss the
sensitive matter.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors may face difficulties, too. Lab officials say
archival data on the detailed computer usage of employees goes back
only a decade or so, blurring the issue of whether Dr. Lee's
actions were aberrant or unremarkable over the half century of the
lab's existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go far enough back in time,'' said Dr. Richard P.
Kendall, the lab's director of computer security, ``you can't
reconstruct the past.'' The further back, the fuzzier the
reconstruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The main way of tracking the computer use of individuals, Dr.
Kendall said, is the Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion
Reporter, known as Nadir, which shadows users to make sure they are
obeying the rules of the road. He said Los Alamos installed Nadir
in 1989, a decade or so after Dr. Lee began working at the weapons
lab. But only top security officials have access to the monitoring
data, and even the degree to which monitoring occurs is a
laboratory secret.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos, the city and lab, seem shaken in the wake of the
case. ``The influence has been devastating,'' said Dr. Siegfried
Hecker, director of the weapons lab from 1986 to 1997, who works
here as a senior scientist. ``I've never seen anything close to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hecker, who has been rebuked by federal officials for
failing to take more aggressive action in the Lee case when he was
director, said a rising tide of overly zealous rules were throwing
the lab into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a federal moratorium went into effect that bars new
hiring of scientists from potentially unfriendly countries like
China, the rules put in place because of espionage fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing what no foreign nation could to do to us,'' Dr.
Hecker said. ``We're crippling ourselves.''

   &UR; THE LAW SHE IS A TRICKY DEVIL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Civil Justice Association of California _ formerly, &LR;  the
Association for California Tort Reform, seemingly an anti-litigant
group _ has named California's Most Outrageous Lawsuits of the
Decade. Three pick hits:
</P>
<P>
   - A case in which a man sued beer vendors in a baseball stadium
for emotional distress incurred when he saw women using a men's
room during a rock concert. He blamed the beer vendor for sending
him on numerous trips to the rest room.
</P>
<P>
   - A case where a bank robber sued a bank, the police and a
California city, &LR;  after he got away from the bank with marked money
containing a tear gas device that caused him burns when he stuffed
it into his pants.
</P>
<P>
   - An Orange County city was sued for not maintaining its
property when an 11-year-old ran over his finger while
skateboarding.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Long live love: A San Francisco city employee, given a
sick-pay transfer form to donate hours to a colleague in need, was
fascinated by the form's Marital Status Declaration, an
encapsulation of the state of modern romance:
</P>
<P>
   Either the donor is married, in which case the donor's spouse
has to approve the gift, or 1) ``I am not married.'' 2) ``I do not
know, and I have taken all reasonable steps to determine, the
whereabouts of my current spouse.'' 3) ``I and my current spouse
have executed a marriage settlement agreement pursuant to Title II
of Part 5 of Division 4 of the California Civil Code (or a
predecessor statute, if applicable) which makes my earnings my
separate property.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Jodie Foster  &LR; is fighting with CBS over a $12,000 hair and
makeup bill incurred in preparation for her appearance on ``60
Minutes II'' last week, &LR;  to promote ``Anna and the King.'' The New
York Post says that NBC settled with Foster by sharing the costs of
her hair and makeup with the movie's studio.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Barbara  &LR; and  &UR; Dennis Kavanagh &LR;  of Mill Valley, sailing
through the Panama Canal alongside a vessel filled with crew
members for the movie ``The Perfect Storm,'' came face to face (bow
to bow) with the WWII battleship New Jersey. As the 57-year-old
ship passed, all hands on the two boats going in the other
direction saluted.
</P>
<P>
   - Organizers of the Miss America pageant are thinking about
moving the contest from September to October so as not to compete
for television viewers with the Olympics, which will be broadcast
from Australia between September 15 and October 1.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Muhammad Ali &LR;  will ring the opening bell at the New York
Stock Exchange on December 31.
</P>
<P>
   - Emcee  &UR; Jan Wahl &LR;  proclaimed  &UR; Tom Ammiano  &LR; ``Mayor of the
Emerald City'' last week, &LR;  when the defeated candidate escorted
 &UR; Lorna Luft &LR;  down the aisle of the Castro Theatre er  &LR; at  &UR; Marc &LR; 
 &UR; Huestis &LR; ' ``A  &UR; Judy Garland &LR;  Christmas.'' Luft, Garland's daughter,
revealed that  &UR; Judy Davis  &LR; will play her mother in a made-for-TV
movie based on her book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOMAGE TO A FRIEND &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pat Steger &LR; , The Chronicle's late social columnist, is to be
remembered with a circle of tiles in Pioneer Park, at the base of
Coit Tower.
</P>
<P>
   The Pat Steger circle will be located near an already existing
 &UR; Herb Caen &LR;  circle. Neighborhood preservationists have been raising
money for park restoration by selling tiles marked with donors'
names.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous colleague bought the first tile; friends  &UR; Carole &LR; 
 &UR; Shorenstein  &LR; and  &UR; Jeff Hays  &LR; bought the second. Tile purchases are
$500, tax deductible. A flyer is available at (415) 398-5112.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Egg magazine names Coit Tower one of the best Lovers Lanes
_ not literally a lane but a place for necking in cars _ in the

</P>
<P>
   And  &UR; Ken Maley  &LR; forwards Men's Fitness magazine, which says that
San Francisco is the fifth fittest city in the country. The city's
``cool weather is ideal for most fitness-minded outdoor pursuits,''
says the magazine. (The other four: San Diego, Minneapolis,

<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO _ Overwhelmed by the damage that extensive
flooding and mudslides inflicted along its Caribbean coast late
last week, Venezuela struggled Monday to rescue survivors of the
tragedy and to calculate the loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of dead in what authorities describe as
the worst natural disaster in modern times in Venezuela varied
wildly, reflecting the chaotic conditions in the devastated zone.
Military and civil defense units have been working around the clock
to remove victims. Thousands of families have been displaced or
separated and do not know whether their missing relatives are dead
or alive.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with foreign reporters on Sunday and early Monday,
Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Vicente Rangel variously estimated
that the floods and mudslides that accompanied three days of heavy
rains could have killed 5,000 to 20,000 people. But at a news
conference later Monday, he acknowledged that ``any figure that we
give is more in the realm of speculation than reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Military officials, in contrast, said more than 1,000 bodies had
been recovered, mostly from the hard-hit coastal states of Vargas
and Miranda. And in a television address to the nation Sunday,
President Hugo Chavez, a former Army paratrooper who has personally
taken command of relief efforts, put the death toll at less than
600, but added, ``I have good reason to think there are bodies that
we will never find.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the much lower figure initially cited by Chavez would make
the calamity the worst natural disaster in Venezuela in this
century. The previous most deadly disaster was an earthquake in
Caracas, the capital, in 1967, when 300 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 150,000 people, mostly residents of the shantytowns
that climb the mountains that ring Caracas and other large cities,
have been left homeless. They have taken refuge at any site that
can accommodate them like Simon Bolivar International Airport near
the capital, parks, schools and churches.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the uncertainty, Chavez urged news organizations
Monday to exercise added caution with casualty estimates. He
acknowledged that no reliable count was available, but said
speculation was merely contributing to the anguish and confusion.
``At times,'' he said, ``rumors get spread about, and that is
dangerous and delicate. Let's try to be as objective, calm and
patient as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Chavez pointed to the case of El Guapo, east of
the capital, where a dam overflowed last week, forcing the removal
of residents of several towns. He said the number of missing there
appeared to be 15 or 20, ``and not this horrifying figure of 2,000
dead that somebody announced on television.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a daily in Caracas, El Universal, published a
front-page story in which Mayor Lenin Marcano of La Guaira, on the
coast, was quoted as having said he believed that 25,000 people had
died in his town. He has retracted that statement.
</P>
<P>
   As relief experts are well aware, confusion is customary in the
tumult that follows disasters, even in developed countries like the
United States. But uncertainties are magnified and relief efforts
hampered in poorer developing countries, including Venezuela and
other Latin American nations that lack strong communications and
transportation systems and well-organized and prepared civil
defense organizations.
</P>
<P>
   When a hurricane devastated Central America last year, initial
estimates of the dead in Honduras, both the poorest country in that
region and the one most severely affected, ranged up to 15,000. But
the Honduran government later backed away from that figure, and the
toll in Central America from the hurricane is now estimated at less
than 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster in Venezuela has also played into politics. Chavez
took office in February, and his critics have seized on the
disaster to criticize him and his highly personalized style of
government. In a referendum last Wednesday, the day when the rains
began, Venezuelans overwhelmingly approved a Constitution that
grants the president and his allies in the military new and
expanded powers.
</P>
<P>
   A long article Sunday in another daily in Caracas, El Nacional,
maintained that the government was so busy preparing for the vote
that it ignored reports that unusually bad weather was on the way.
``It was a tragedy that could have been seen coming,'' the
newspaper wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's recent war of words with the Roman Catholic church,
including personal attacks on leading prelates, has also become a
factor. In a sermon Sunday that echoed remarks heard in the streets
since the calamity began, Archbishop Ignacio Velasco of Caracas
said it was the president's ``arrogance that attracted the wrath of
God'' and led to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel, the foreign minister, said Monday, ``It was nature, and
not God'' that has ravaged the country, adding that it is the
responsibility of all institutions to ``show restraint in their use
of language'' in the crisis.

&HT;     POP CULTURE CAN MAKE OR BREAK A CLICHE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It is worth remembering, says the president of
the Popular Culture Association, that there was a time _ precisely
three months ago _ when no one in the history of the planet had
heard the phrase, ``Drop the Chalupa.''
</P>
<P>
   Or knew what it meant.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it means anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   Now, spawned by the Taco Bell commercial featuring an officious
Chihuahua, the Chalupa is now part of the vocabulary, with the ad's
signature phrase being repeated by everyone from sports
commentators to students to business executives. Even when he is
trying to avoid it, Professor Robert Thompson says he hears it at
least three times a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting is there is no context for it,'' said
Thompson, founding director of the Center for the Study of Popular
Television at Syracuse University in Syracuse, N.Y., and head of
the Popular Culture Association. ``There are virtually no places in
American life where it makes sense to say `Drop the Chalupa,' no
way to use Newtonian physics to figure out why it caught on. But
people are saying `Drop the Chalupa' and getting huge laughs. It's
almost a punch line without a setup.''
</P>
<P>
   As the cast of ``Friends'' would say _ in the vapid vocal
construction that has been emulated by the nation's youth _ he's SO
looking forward to never hearing it again.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just Chalupalooza that is sending Thompson to the
edge. There's another monster catchphrase sweeping the country _
for this one, blame Regis Philbin and his ABC quiz show ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hear the line `Is that your final answer?' one more time,
I'm going to hang myself,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Language is an elusive animal that doesn't evolve according to
what English professors teach in classrooms,'' he said. ``Instead,
it evolves according to real people. Walt Whitman was all about the
common people. And just the same, Regis Philbin can change our
language. Philbin and Whitman are kindred spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   These social slogans, and dozens more before them _ everything
from ``Make my day'' to ``Where's the beef?'' _ have rocketed into
the American lexicon. Like cultural viruses, they leap into the
vocabulary, spreading unpredictably, gaining unlikely footholds.
They have become our national glue, delivered direct by Hollywood
and Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a relative fluke, it was the right thing for the
</P>
<P>
   dog to say,'' said Chuck Bennett, the creative director behind
</P>
<P>
   the Chalupa commercial. An advertising veteran who works for the
TBWA/Chiat/Day agency, Bennett recently flew to Hawaii to film a
new commercial when he heard a fellow passenger use the Chalupa
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you set out to write one that would catch on, it probably
wouldn't,'' he said. ``We wanted the Chalupa line to be funny and
catchy but we never thought America would be saying it. Now there's
an expectation that everything the dog says will be repeated by
America. It's horrible, the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some catchphrases serendipitously survive _ indeed, Philbin's
annoyingly repetitious game show query could endure for
generations, a sort of lowbrow Catch-22 of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Most catchphrases, however, have the staying power of an eye
blink. Virtually unanimously, prognosticators believe that ``Drop
the Chalupa'' will barely make it into the next millennium before
becoming an exhausted victim of its own fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sudden popularity kills it, it becomes not cool anymore,''
Bennett said. ``That's OK because we'll be onto something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Catchphrase lifespan depends on utility as well as an
increasingly brief hipness factor. Today what may be cool _ a word
enjoying renewed popularity after a long hiatus _ is passe
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go out as fast as they come in,'' said Professor Donna Jo
Napoli, head of the linguistics department at Swarthmore College in
Pennsylvania. ``What sticks is something that resonates, like
`Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The older a catchphrase becomes, the more it comes to have
meaning. But it's really rare for a commercial to stick,'' Napoli
said.
</P>
<P>
   The television program ``Seinfeld,'' a catchphrase gold mine,
cannily captured self-absorbed life in the late 20th century,
giving rise to such memorable nuggets as ``master of my domain,''
meaning masturbation, and ``double-dipping'' to describe the
execrable practice of dipping one's chip, biting, then re-dipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yada, yada, yada'' was a phrase used by a minor portion of the
population until adopted by Seinfeld and given the massive push of
a hit show to become wildly in vogue.
</P>
<P>
   In order to tickle that collective consciousness, catchphrases
must embody a certain novelty and resonance. ``Drop the Chalupa''
would scarcely have worked, experts agree, had the commercial said
instead ``Drop the burrito,'' or even worse, ``Drop the coq au
vin.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sound-bite world, it is not sufficient for a movie or
television show to be merely good _ it also needs a grabby slogan,
said Stephen Kraus, an Alameda resident who holds a doctorate in
social psychology from Harvard University and is a partner at
Yankelovich Partners, a marketing research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't name half the presidents of the United States but I
could tell you ``Drop the Chalupa,''' he sighed. ``It tells you
something about the times in which we live doesn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Kraus has coined his own catchphrase, one that might sweep the
nation in coming months: ``That's so 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means something outdated,'' he said. ``I use it a lot with
my sister. She's still using DOS applications on her computer.
That's technology from 1985, can you believe it?''

FEDERAL PLANS TO UPDATE MOBILE HOME RULES WORRY CONSUMERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ala., Colo.)   By CARL HULSE   NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is poised to overhaul outdated federal
rules governing construction of manufactured housing, rules
patterned more after motor vehicle safety laws than building codes
when they were first adopted in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups worry that in their push to modernize
regulations designed when mobile homes were often attached to a
trailer hitch, lawmakers will put industry in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   AARP and other advocates for owners of manufactured homes say
that legislation before the House and Senate would unfairly stack a
new ``consensus'' committee charged with overseeing quality
standards in favor of builders and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think you have a fox in the chicken coop here,''
complained Roy Green, an AARP lobbyist closely following the issue.
</P>
<P>
   AARP and a handful of state activists also criticized the
emerging legislation for its failure to include federal warranties
for either manufacture or installation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are at the mercy of the industry,'' the Federation
of Manufactured Home Owners of Florida wrote to the House Banking
Committee in an appeal for changes in its measure. ``A lack of
warranty is one of the greatest problems with manufactured
housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives dismiss the complaints and say home
buyers would be the ultimate beneficiaries of the changes because
they would get a home built to the latest standards with the best
materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, both consumers and the industry favor
result-oriented, cost-effective regulation that ensures both safety
and sound construction at a reasonable price,'' said William Lear,
vice president of Fleetwood Enterprises, as he presented the
industry perspective to a Senate panel last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Though the House and Senate held hearings on the legislation,
neither chamber acted before adjourning for the year, however, it
is likely a revamped manufactured housing law will clear Congress
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now widespread agreement that it is time to update
and improve this act,'' said Sen. Wayne Allard, a Colorado
Republican, who is chairman of the Senate Banking Subcommittee with
jurisdiction over the law. ``Manufactured housing has changed a
great deal in the past 25 years and we are dealing with outdated
laws and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the policy dispute concede the law and Department
of Housing and Urban Development oversight of the industry have not
kept pace with the rise in popularity of the housing or changes in
available materials and building practices. A cumbersome process
for winning code changes keeps manufacturing behind the times and
adds to the cost of homes, industry allies say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the HUD code hasn't kept pace with many safety
innovations and technologies of today's marketplace,'' said Rep.
Robert Aderholt, an Alabama Republican whose district is a center
of the manufactured housing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the likelihood of passage is that HUD, which has
fought past updates, now appears open to the congressional action.
</P>
<P>
   Two major trade groups, the Manufactured Housing Institute and
the Manufactured Housing Association for Regulatory Reform, sought
changes for years but have come up short. As a result, the industry
mobilized in recent elections to increase its visibility and clout
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign
contributions, showed more than $61,000 in industry money going
directly to the parties since 1997 and more than $300,000 given to
congressional candidates, predominantly Republicans. The groups
also spent more than $350,000 on direct lobbying of Congress in
1998, according to the most recent reports.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, consumer groups are loosely organized and have no
national presence in Washington. AARP officials say their
organization stepped in because manufactured housing is popular
among its members, particularly those retiring to the Sun Belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry is well-organized and well-financed and these
individuals are not,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative fight centers mainly on the make-up of the
consensus committee, which would recommend changes in standards and
enforcement to HUD. The industry hopes creation of the committee
would expedite such reviews.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups take issue with the composition of the
25-member panel, which would have five builders, five from other
industry sectors such as retailing, five consumers, five public
officials and five other interested parties such as architects and
developers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say industry would hold far too much sway over the
group, allowing consumers to be steamrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Authors of the legislation disagree but say they are willing to
consider revisions to build support for a measure that already has
solid bipartisan backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe for the bill to move forward we are going to have to
change a few things,'' conceded Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., a main
Senate sponsor. ``We know this bill was a first draft, not the last
word.''
</P>
<P>
   The other main sticking point is warranties. AARP said its
survey of manufactured housing owners found widespread
dissatisfaction with new purchases. Data it collected from the top
destinations for manufactured housing _ predominantly Southeastern
states _ showed more than 7,000 consumer complaints in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   AARP's Green said the lack of a warranty results in what he
describes as the ``ping-pong problem'' _ buyers shuttling back and
forth between builder and installer as they try to get someone to
take responsibility for fixing problems. AARP would like a
five-year guarantee on construction and two years on installation,
with the requirement applied only to new homes and their first
installation.
</P>
<P>
   The industry and its congressional allies are dead-set against a
warranty requirement, saying warranties can already be purchased
and that requiring them would only drive up the cost of
manufactured housing for little return. Problems found in the AARP
survey were usually minor and cost less to fix than buying a
warranty, according to the Coalition to Improve the Manufactured
Housing Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, mandatory federal warranties will actually be
more harmful to consumers,'' said Kami Watson, a spokeswoman for
that group.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials also oppose the warranty proposal, with U.S.
Housing Commissioner William Apgar terming them
``counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With many private companies already developing new warranty
products, I believe it is preferable to let the market drive
innovations in this area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green said AARP would continue to fight to enhance consumer
protections in any final legislation given the stake many
manufactured home buyers have in their new residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is their version of the American dream,'' he said.

KOHL'S SECRECY ON HUGE POLITICAL GIFTS THREATENS HIS LEGACY AND HIS
PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ During his 16 years as chancellor of
Germany, Helmut Kohl was famous for his Sitzfleisch _ which roughly
translates as the ability to weather problems by sitting them out.
</P>
<P>
   But now, one year after Germans voted him out of office, Kohl
appears bent on exceeding his own reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl stunned Germans earlier this month when he admitted, after
previous denials, that he had used a slew of illegal bank accounts
to accept secret political contributions and channel money to local
branches in his center-right party, the Christian Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kohl, 69, is invoking his personal honor in refusing to
reveal the names of people who he said contributed more than $1
million between 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The donors had my word that they would remain anonymous,''
Kohl said in an interview published last weekend in the Bild
newspaper. ``I keep my promises, and I will not identify the
donors. But I can tell you this much: They are upstanding German
citizens who donated the money from their own wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as new details trickle out almost daily, the scandal
threatens to engulf both Kohl and the Christian Democratic Union.
It seems likely to shred Kohl's place in history as the man who
both re-unified Germany and led much of Europe toward a single
common currency.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's image is becoming that of a small-time machine-politician
who accepted cash payments from shadowy business people and used an
off-the-books system of slush funds to shore up support within
party ranks.
</P>
<P>
   But the widening investigations could shake the Christian
Democratic Union itself. German newspaper and television reports
have charged that party officials in eastern Germany received large
sums of money from the French oil company Elf Aquitaine, which took
over a huge chemical complex in the eastern city of Leuna in 1992.
And this weekend, party officials admitted that documents related
to Elf's purchase had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Other brush fires have broken out as well. The Christian
Democratic Union's official records note that a Hamburg businessman
named Karl Ehlerding contributed about $1.8 million shortly before
he won a big contract to manage the privatization of real estate
owned by the German national rail system.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions were properly disclosed, but have now been
re-examined because of the potential conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Last but not least, a top manager at the accounting firm that
kept track of the secret accounts admitted he had made scores of
trips to Zurich on party business, giving rise to allegations that
Kohl diverted money to Swiss bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   While creating turmoil within the Christian Democratic Union,
the relentless stream of disclosures has strengthened the hand of
Kohl's successor as party chairman, Wolfgang Schaeuble. Despite his
election ouster as chancellor, Kohl remains a member of parliament
and had until recently stayed active in party business. Now
Schaeuble, who had until the scandal been laboring in Kohl's
shadow, is trying to push his former mentor onto the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has admitted he received 300,000 to 400,000 marks a year
over a five-year period and admitted that the donations came in
cash _ ``because donors wanted to remain anonymous.'' But he has
steadfastly denied using any of the money to enrich himself or
letting government decisions be swayed by the donations.
</P>
<P>
   But now he is under pressure from all sides to tell everything
he knows.
</P>
<P>
   Volker Neumann, chairman of a parliamentary committee
investigating the affair, threatened Kohl on Sunday with fines or
even imprisonment if he refuses to identify the secret donors.
</P>
<P>
   And although Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has remained fairly
quiet about the issue, other leaders of the ruling Social Democrat
Party have vowed to force Kohl into cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not enough to tell us he took a vow of secrecy, like
some sort of Godfather,'' said Frank Hofmann, a Social Democratic
member on the investigating committee, in an interview in the
Sunday issue of Bild.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christian Democratic leaders are now begging Kohl open up
as well. Monday, he answered questions in a closed-door meeting
with Ernst &AMP; Young, the auditing firm hired by his successors in
the party leadership to investigate the secret accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the investigations will drag on for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Bonn and elsewhere are still deciding whether to
open formal criminal investigations, but seem likely to do so.
Meanwhile, Neumann, head of the parliamentary investigation, has
said his work could take two years to complete.

   PERSONAL-GENOMICS (Undated) _ Biochips look like the integrated

study of all the genes in a living organism, out of the research
laboratory and into the daily practice of medicine. If genomics
delivers on its promise, health care will shift from a focus on
detection and treatment to a process of prediction and prevention.

COMMENTARY: PUNISHING THE COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As we enter the new millennium, the population of
America's prisons and jails is approaching 2 million. It will pass
that mark, according to the Justice Policy Institute in Washington,
around Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   In the entire world about 8 million people are incarcerated, so
a quarter of them are in this country. The number of prisoners has
been growing at an extraordinary pace, up 70 percent in the last 10
years. We have overtaken Russia for the honor of having the world's
highest incarceration rate.
</P>
<P>
   All this has a profound social cost. Since 1995 the states have
spent more on prison than on university construction. Operating
prisons in the year 2000 will cost about $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And of course it is not just the money. Two-thirds of the
prisoners are there for nonviolent offenses. Chances are good that
by the time they are released _ after sentences that are among the
longest anywhere _ they will be thoroughly brutalized.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are so stunning that even some experts known for
taking a hard line on crime think it is time for a reappraisal of
criminal justice policies. One is Professor John J. DiIulio Jr. of
Princeton. He summed up his view in The Wall Street Journal in
March under the headline ``Two Million Prisoners Are Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of imprisonment is a portrait in the law of rapidly
diminishing returns,'' DiIulio said. He noted that correctional
costs were squeezing money for policing. He urged officials
everywhere to maintain gains in public safety ``while keeping the
prison population around 2 million and even aiming to reduce it
over the next decade.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end he suggested, first, repealing mandatory-minimum
drug sentencing laws. Since 1973 the Rockefeller drug laws in New
York state have imposed fixed terms running from 15 years to life
for all kinds of offenses. Federal laws also include many mandatory
minimums.
</P>
<P>
   The result of fixed sentences is to put hundreds of thousands of
nonviolent drug offenders away for many years, at great cost to
them and to us. About a quarter of those in American prisons and
jails are drug violators, according to the Justice Policy
Institute. Their number has gone up sevenfold in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   DiIulio called for the release of nonviolent offenders
imprisoned only for drug violations. He also urged that drug
treatment be required for users, in prison and afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that requires extremely long sentences for drug and
some other crimes is a political phenomenon of the last 25 years or
so. Few politicians, state or national, have been willing to
challenge the mantra of ``toughness on crime'' _ willing to look at
the harsh consequences of such rigidity, human and societal.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory-minimum sentences seem to me to reflect the delusion
that eliminating the element of judgment will make the criminal
justice system work better. Absolute rules assure certainty. But
they also assure injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving too much discretion to judges risks uneven sentences.
Leaving none produces equally harsh sentences for situations and
individuals that demand different treatment. The same delusion mars
the 1996 Immigration Act, with its requirement of automatic
deportation for minor crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The other distinctive feature of criminal justice in the United
States is capital punishment. All other Western countries have
given it up as an atavistic barbarity. It continues here despite a
growing number of releases of death-row prisoners after last-minute
proof of their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Study after study has shown that executions do not deter further
murders. Yet George W. Bush has defended the death penalty on the
ground that it ``will save other innocent lives.''
</P>
<P>
   As governor of Texas, Bush has presided over 113 executions,
more than any other governor in modern times. A compelling Boston
Globe story by John Aloysius Farrell pointed out that in the next
five weeks Bush must deal with five more scheduled deaths, one of a
prisoner with a mental age of 7, two others who committed their
crimes as juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's action in those cases, and the public reaction, will tell
much about his and our humanity.

 COMMENTARY: GORE-BRADLEY Vs. LINCOLN-DOUGLAS  
(jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most terrifying threat of the holiday season is not Y2K
computer failure. It's Al Gore's new idea that he and Bill Bradley
should have nonstop debates for the next four or five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have two debates every single week and get rid of all
of the television and radio commercials,'' he proposed on ``Meet
the Press'' last weekend. ``I'm willing to do it right now if
you'll shake on it.'' He offered his hand to Bradley, who stared at
it as if it were a seven-day-old mackerel.
</P>
<P>
   We have had three Democratic debates so far, and three with all
the Republican candidates. They've been useful, but I think I am
speaking for us all when I say you can have too much of a fairly
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quick question:  &LR; Why is it that we get bored with these debates
so easily when people in the 1850s would stand in the sun for five
hours listening to Abraham Lincoln argue with Stephen Douglas?
</P>
<P>
   A. The politicians back then were better orators.
</P>
<P>
   B. The voters were better citizens.
</P>
<P>
   C. The only competing form of entertainment was watching the
rutabagas grow.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, while Lincoln was one great speaker, only the front of
the crowd could hear a word he was saying. And if the 19th-century
voters were all that enlightened, how do you explain President
Franklin Pierce? James Buchanan? Two terms worth of Ulysses Grant?
</P>
<P>
   The current debates can actually be very interesting, under the
proper circumstances. I recommend taping the Republican ones, so
you can fast-forward through all candidates who have never
succeeded in even getting elected to an office in their hometown
PTA. If you also skip over any speaker who has yet to break the 1
percent mark in the polls, you'll be pleasantly surprised by how
quickly the event flies by.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are a little harder to handle, since there are
only two of them, and the differences between their positions are
rather subtle. On the issue of Social Security entitlements, for
instance, as far as I can determine Gore would cut off both his
hands before he would allow anybody to raise the eligibility age,
whereas Bradley would probably only chop off one hand and a couple
of additional fingers.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, the famous battle over health insurance.
Gore and Bradley both want to see every American covered, but have
genuinely different views on how to get there. This is exactly the
sort of policy dispute we're always telling you to pay attention
to. I am therefore more than a little embarrassed to admit that
listening to the Democrats arguing about health care plans is only
slightly more fun than getting stuck in an elevator with somebody
who wants to explain why the new millennium does not begin until
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Let me give you an idea of how it goes. At one point in Sunday's
debate, Bradley asserted that under his approach, 30 million of the
45 million currently uninsured Americans would get coverage, while
Gore's plan would only reach an additional 7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gore: Can I tell you something, I disagree with that strongly.
Let me just say that independent analysis, including at the Emory
School of Public Health, Marty Feldstein, have showed that we get
just about the same amount of people.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley (incredulously): You're quoting  &UR; Marty Feldstein? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gore: ... 88 percent, 89 percent, the difference is ...
</P>
<P>
   Bradley: That's incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   At which point, the faithful audience members go out to the
kitchen to hit themselves over the head with a skillet.
</P>
<P>
   But if you keep listening, letting all the rhetoric wash over
you, you will pick things up. For instance, you will eventually
notice that Al Gore is a tough but weaselly debater. (When Bradley
called his debate idea ``ridiculous,'' the vice president managed
to look as though his heart were broken. He also specializes in
sighing with deep exasperation whenever his opponent manages to get
three words in edgewise.) Bradley is more dignified, but tends to
fade into the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   We will resume our debate coverage in the new year. While it
probably won't live up to Lincoln-Douglas standards, I think we can
top Buchanan-Fremont or Grant-Greeley.

HOLIDAY SEASON PRESENTS SPECIAL ISSUES AT WORK

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q -- I'm not a Scrooge about Christmas, but I am so tired of all
the time at work that is being spent on parties, exchanging gifts,
and chattering away about one Christmas activity or another. I've
had enough of it and Christmas isn't even here yet. Do you have any
suggestions? L.B.
</P>
<P>
   A -- It is true that Christmas can be a time when not a creature
is working, not even a mouse pad. In some companies the employees
flip into their Christmas mode just after Thanksgiving and do not
return to the work mode until the new year. In other companies,
depending on such factors as their work cycles, industry or
financial condition, there can be minimal behavioral changes during
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   If your company is in the holiday mode, but you are not, you can
still keep your primary focus on your work, while being selective
as to the holiday activities in which you participate. This does
not mean that you utter ``bah humbug'' when someone wishes you
happy holidays, but rather that you need not spend inordinate
amounts of time decking the halls.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, if many of your associates feel as you do, it may
be worthwhile to meet with management to talk about next year's
Christmas activities. It is entirely possible you will come up with
some ideas that will help make next year's holiday season more
meaningful and enjoyable for all. One such thought might be to give
presents to the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   You and your associates may feel better about the holiday
activities if more of them were truly focused on peace on Earth and
good will to all.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- Our company recently hired a new office manager, but she
does not know how to manage at all. She runs around here doing
menial tasks and getting in the way, and we have to train her in so
many areas while she is supervising us. This seems unfair, and
there are several of us who should have been promoted instead of
hiring her from the outside. What should we do? P.C.
</P>
<P>
   A -- When a company hires new leadership in the face of its own
arguably qualified employees, it is not uncommon for the new
leadership to face resistance. Hence, the first question is whether
this new manager is truly out to lunch, or whether you and your
associates have locked her out.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, a new leader may lack some of the technical
skills necessary to carry out the jobs of their employees, but they
bring strong skills in such areas as motivation, team building,
communication, and goal-setting. However, if this new manager is
truly focusing on menial tasks rather than meaningful tasks, then
perhaps she is truly over her head as well as over yours.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the best step is to let some more time pass, try
to be fair and supportive in your dealings with her, and keep the
communication lines open. Through increased communication with her,
the transition can be eased for all of you. And, if the passage of
time finds her even further engrossed with menial tasks, you should
consider discussing the situation with senior management. In fact,
unless senior management is equally focused on menial chores, they
will have already focused on her.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- We are in sales and our company has a very grumpy
receptionist who answers the phones. She is short with the callers,
always in a huff, and by the time the call gets to us, the caller
is upset. We have mentioned this to the receptionist's supervisor
and even to management, but their attitude is that she is doing
just fine. What can we do about this? J.K. &QL; 
!tag!d &QC; 3,3!tag!
</P>
<P>
   A -- Your receptionist may act like Grumpy, but management
sounds like Dopey. The real problem is that management of your
sales organization thinks that it is just fine for customers to be
annoyed whenever they call.
</P>
<P>
   You need to do more than mention this issue to management. You
and your associates should go back, bring documented complaints if
you have any, and then present some suggestions as to how to deal
with this receptionist. For example, be prepared to suggest some
training programs, incentives, or closer supervision and guidance
to help her perform her job more courteously and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Over the longer term, if you see some improvement in her
performance, be sure to let her and her supervisor know. However,
if she continues her grumpy act, you should revisit this issue with
management. If management continues to believe that ignoring the
salespeople is an effective way to run a business, they'll run
right into the ground.

 &HT;    Georgians react to same-sex marriage ruling
 &HT;    By Jay Croft
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In an unprecedented ruling that could lead gay
marriages, the Vermont Supreme Court said Monday that gay couples
must receive the same benefits and protections afforded straight
couples who marry.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ruling has no immediate effect in any other state,
Georgians on both sides of the issue reacted strongly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely plan on going to Vermont as soon as it gets
worked out,'' said Atlanta physician Ray Deeb. ``We want to get
married _ domestic partners, whatever they want to call it.''
</P>
<P>
   Deeb walked down a church aisle in a commitment ceremony last
year with his partner, Jerry Gonzalez, and consider themselves
married.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Knox, executive director of the Georgia Equality Project,
a gay rights organization, said, ``It's a very hopeful legal
precedent that we hope will be paid attention to by other
jurisdictions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed and, once again, it looks like judges are
trying to create law,'' said Ron Crews, a Gwinnett County pastor
and former state representative who authored the state marriage
bill. ``I'm grateful for what we've done in Georgia, anticipating
events like this.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., sponsored the federal marriage bill,
which President Clinton signed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly encourage Vermont to follow Hawaii's lead and take
legislative action to block this misguided decision by an activist
court,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   The court shopped short of ordering the Vermont to allow gay
marriage, but instead gave the Legislature the choice between that
and creating some form of state-sanctioned domestic partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold that the state is constitutionally required to extend
to same-sex couples the common benefits and protections that flow
from marriage under Vermont law,'' the justices said. The
Legislature ``must conform with the constitutional imperative to
afford all Vermonters the common benefit, protection and security
of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous order came less than two weeks after Hawaii's
highest court shut down the possibility of gay marriage there, once
considered the state most likely to allow same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists hope the Vermont decision could be the first step
in challenging a federal ban on same-sex marriages. The Defense of
Marriage Act allows states to ignore same-sex unions performed in
other states, which gay activists say is unconstitutional. Same-sex
marriages are not allowed in any state; at least 30 have explicitly
banned them. The Georgia ruling in 1996 defined marriage as between
a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining legal recognition in Vermont issues could give gay
couples the legal standing to sue to overturn the federal law, said
Peg Byron of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't go the whole nine yards (and grant marriage), but
it's also the first time anywhere a government has declared that it
must protect gay couples as much as it protects straight couples _
basically, that gay couples are equal to non-gay couples,'' Byron
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont ruling was highly anticipated by both sides of the
fight over letting gays marry, which was sparked by Hawaii's
Supreme Court in 1993. It found that the state's failure to
recognize gay marriages amounted to gender discrimination. Voters
there amended the Constitution last year to prohibit same-sex
unions.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont ruling stemmed from a suit filed in July 1997 by
three same-sex couples denied marriage licenses by town clerks. A
judge threw out the suit, but the couples appealed to the state
Supreme Court, whose decision may not be appealed to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The couples said the state was denying them more than 300 state
benefits and 1,000 federal benefits. The court found those benefits
include access to insurance, hospital visitation and other power to
make medical decisions, inheritance rights ``and many other
statutory protections.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's Speaker of the House said the Legislature probably
will approve domestic partnership rather than marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the politically obtainable solution,'' said Michael J.
Obuchowski, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchowski praised the court decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in line with Vermont's appetite for tolerance and, to me,
it means very simply that people should be treated equally, period,
and our Legislature is going to engage in the process of making
that determination,'' he said. ``It's going to be very complex,
very heart-rending, conscience-jolting enterprise, but I think this
Legislature can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchowski said he expects hearings to begin when the
Legislature convenes Jan. 4.

&HT;     CAN SPRING BE FAR AWAY? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (Refiling for those needing   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I saw the first robin of the winter season this
weekend, bob-bob-bobbing along, all fat and sassy. Its arrival is
so premature I longed to buy it a wool muffler. When I was growing
up in the Midwest, it was a major event to spot the first robin,
whose appearance sometime in April meant spring was coming at last.
</P>
<P>
   Now this unexpected holiday presence seems a good omen not just
for continued mild weather but for happy times in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Some places will still have a white Christmas, but we here on
the East Coast head
</P>
<P>
   toward a fresh year with temperatures so balmy that the trees
and plants are as impatient for spring as the birds. In New York,
200 miles north of here, snowdrop bulb shoots are up and forsythia
is in bloom. Here in the nation's capital, the boldest trees
suddenly have that lime-colored feathery look that signifies infant
leaves aborning.
</P>
<P>
   Federal scientists say that in the contiguous 48 states 1999
will go down as one of the warmest years on record and the trend is
likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
   We are indeed a warm and contented nation these days, both
physically and emotionally. We are in a far better mood than last
year at this time. What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19, 1998, the House of Representatives impeached
President Clinton for lying and assorted sins stemming from his
illicit affair with a White House intern. We were tormented by
disgust and divided by partisan rancor. Things were ugly. The
government was immobilized.
</P>
<P>
   The first momentous act of this year was the Senate acquittal of
the president, keeping him in office and avoiding the inevitable
chaos of a transfer of power that an overwhelming majority of
voters told pollsters they opposed. (To this day, 57 percent of
those surveyed still say the Senate action was correct, down 11
percentage points from the number who felt that way during the
trial but still a clear majority.) The acquittal did not wipe out
the stigma Clinton will forever bear of becoming the first elected
president to be impeached, but it did quiet the political uproar.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Congress put up a facade of working
together, but tempers did not cool sufficiently for any major
legislative achievement. It will not be possible next year either
in the midst of the 2000 presidential campaign. We need a breather.
We need another voter referendum to demonstrate the popular will.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, that ``family
values'' champion recently discovered to have been a six-year
adulterer, and his almost-successor Rep. Bob Livingston, who quit
the House to avoid exposure of his own infidelity, took some of the
partisan sting out of Clinton's misbehavior. Republicans can be
scoundrels too. The GOP no longer has a political lock on moral
values.
</P>
<P>
   But as a country we are still uneasy about our ethical standards
_ or lack of them.
</P>
<P>
   For all their moralizing, politicians do not have the answers.
Instead, religious values have taken on new political importance.
</P>
<P>
   Violence, particularly in the schools, is deeply troubling.
Something in our culture needs fixing, and there is no consensus to
point the way. We will have to deal with it in the next century. A
democracy is a work in progress. There is always unfinished
business _ in education, in retirement security, in abusive
campaign practices.
</P>
<P>
   The key to our present overall satisfaction is peace and
prosperity, the two traditional pillars of political stability. We
are in an unprecedented period of economic growth, spread unevenly
but widely enough to touch most of us. American soldiers are not
dying on foreign soil in some dimly understood cause. There are
wars around the globe, but we are basically keeping our military
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Since welfare reform, the rolls have been cut in half. The
violent crime rate has also dropped dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 presidential campaign is already down to two
Republicans and two Democrats, all qualified, substantive men. No
matter which one wins, the republic will be in safe hands. (I'm
ignoring the Reform Party, which is a joke and hasn't a chance
anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the issues is sometimes heavy going, more for
policy wonks than ordinary folk, but it may be useful to the future
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good time to be alive and an American. It may not yet be
springtime in this country, but the turn of the century is a
wonderful moment for robins.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers on Monday
honored the four U.S. Customs Service inspectors who arrested a
suspected terrorist last week after discovering bomb-making
materials in his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men and women are true heroes,'' Summers told a packed
auditorium at the Ronald Reagan Building here. ``Thank you on
behalf on all Americans for making our country safer and
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary then presented Inspectors Diana M. Dean, Mark
Johnson and Carmon Clem with the department's exceptional service
award. Inspector Mike Chapman, who was unable to attend the
ceremony, will be given the award in Port Angeles, Wash., where all
four inspectors work.
</P>
<P>
   After the final medal was awarded, the crowd of more than 1,000
people, most of whom were U.S. Customs Service employees, gave the
inspectors a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agents, the suspect, Ahmed Ressam, 32, arrived
at Port Angeles, about 60 miles northwest of Seattle, around 6 p.m.
last Tuesday (Dec. 14) on a ferry from Victoria, British Columbia,
driving a Chrysler that he had rented in Canada. His car was the
last one off the ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said the Algerian-born Ressam was ``acting nervous'' while
she asked him routine questions about what was in his car and what
he would be doing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``After working on this job awhile, you get a knack for knowing
when something isn't right,'' said the 19-year veteran agent.
</P>
<P>
   Dean asked Ressam to step out of his car. While she and Johnson
questioned him, Clem began looking through the car. According to
Dean, Ressam gave her false identification papers that said his
name was Benni Noris.
</P>
<P>
   Clem's examination of the car uncovered a number of
false-identity cards, including at least eight credit cards, a
passport and other material under the name Noris.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clem lifted a mat in the trunk of the car to inspect the
well where the spare tire is usually stored. There was no spare
tire. Instead, he found 10 plastic bags containing 118 pounds of a
fine white powder; two plastic containers with 14 pounds of a
crystalline powder; two 22-ounce jars, each about three-quarters
full of a yellowish liquid, and four small black boxes that each
contained a circuit board connected to a Casio watch and a 9-volt
battery. The materials in the black boxes could be used to time a
detonator.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought it was drugs, which is something we come
across much more often,'' Clem said.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering the explosive materials, Dean and Johnson led
the suspect away from the car, but Ressam ``squirmed'' free and
ran, Johnson said. ``One second I have a hold of him; the next, I'm
standing there with an empty coat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, Clem and Chapman chased Ressam for about six blocks,
then spotted him trying to open the door of a car that had slowed
at an intersection. The female driver sped away, and the suspect
was then tackled in the street, according to the Johnson and Clem.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was arrested that day, and last Friday he was charged in
U.S. District Court in Seattle with smuggling explosives into the
United States from Canada and giving false information to U.S.
Customs agents.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam's real identity was determined through fingerprinting
with the help of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, according to
customs officials. He had served a short term for stealing
computers and other equipment and was being sought for other
burglaries, the agents said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI, the crystalline powder found in Ressam's
car was a sulfate used primarily to absorb water and keep things
dry, and the fine white powder was urea, used to manufacture
explosives and fertilizer. Urea was used in the 1993 World Trade
Center bombing in New York City, which killed six people and
injured 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   A massive search is under way for a possible accomplice or
accomplices because Ressam is suspected of acting as a courier for
an unknown terrorist group and because he did not have all of the
elements needed to make a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is trying to determine if Ressam was acting at
the behest of Osama Bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi radical who is
wanted for allegedly ordering the bombing of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is believed to be in Afghanistan, and his main access
to the rest of the world is thought to be through supporters in
Pakistan. Officias here are concerned because the Muslim holy
season of Ramadan coincides with celebrations marking the turn of
the century and the second millennium of Christianity _ a
convergence that authorities fear could entice extremists to resort
to violence.Summers said the Customs Service will deploy extra
inspectors to ports of entry around the country to try to prevent
terrorists from smuggling explosives or weapons into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there are no guarantees when it comes to terrorists,
I firmly believe that with agents such as the ones on this stage,
we will be able to keep our country safe,'' Summers said.

 &HT;    Experts downplay potential for Y2K problems, prescribe steps to
avoid glitches
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger ``Buster'' Sappenfield, a semi-retired professional
golfer, has stored enough water and food to take his family well
past those first iffy weeks of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, Sappenfield, 70, has stockpiled his supply
of medications _ more than seven different prescriptions _ in
anticipation of potential computer glitches in the health care
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these mean life or death to me,'' said Sappenfield, a
Lawrenceville resident who has undergone a triple bypass. ``Why
would I take the chance?''
</P>
<P>
   As the new year looms, some metro Atlantans are not only copying
bank statements and hoarding camping supplies, but also gathering
health care records to make sure when the clock strikes midnight
that their medical safety net doesn't evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Experts almost categorically say patients should be fine as they
plunge into the first weeks of 2000, pointing out that most
insurance companies, hospitals and drugstores have been working to
head off Y2K-related problems for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably going to be the biggest nonevent ever to
occur,'' said Arthur Levin, executive director of the Center for
Medical Consumers, a nonprofit group in New York. ``I'm betting
that there will be little glitches. But, hey, there are little
glitches all the time ... so I don't think it's going to be a big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna-US Healthcare, for example, has been preparing its systems
for the advent of the new century since 1997, spending close to
$200 million on upgrades. The American Medical Association started
updating doctors on Y2K in 1998 through brochures, its Web site and
its magazine, American Medical News. And Eckerd Drugs _ vigorously
advertising its Y2K readiness _ started its computer checks back in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working on this for almost four years. We've tested
and re-tested not only our internal systems, but our external
systems with vendors and distributors,'' said Tami Alderman, Eckerd
Drugs spokeswoman. ``We feel very comfortable with our readiness,
and for us, it will be business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are also protected from the ravages of computer mayhem
simply because many doctors are not that wired. Most patient
records are still meticulously filed in folders stored on shelves _
not on hard drives or discs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of our physicians don't have electronic records
right now,'' said Camilla Grayson, director of health policy at the
Georgia Medical Association. ``So I don't think there is anything
that could go wrong that would directly affect patients, except
maybe in accounts payable. And if anything, that will merely result
in giving them more wiggle room to pay the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   And even pharmacists often keep the handwritten prescriptions
for reference and a protection against liability, meaning there's
little chance of a patient's history disappearing in cyberspace.
But experts also admit that it's hard to anticipate exactly what
will happen. And, as a precaution at least, consumers do need to
take basic steps to prepare for any eventuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most prudent thing to do is take some steps you
should take all year long,'' said Dan Nutkis, director of research
at the Odin Group, a health care research company that has
distributed 20 million consumer guides on Y2K that's also available
at www.healthcarey2kguide
</P>
<P>
   .com. ``Do the basics.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you rely on medication, like Sappenfield, you
should probably make sure you have enough refills to last you
through January _ or at least have handwritten prescriptions that
you can use until February. Also, if you have the same insurance
company in 2000 that you had this year, carry your insurance card
with you to your doctor's office or any medical center you visit
early in the new year _ even if it expires at midnight. It will
allow medical personnel to log, by hand if necessary, a policy
number that probably has not changed.
</P>
<P>
   Things are more dicey for those who have switched insurance
plans. Your old insurance card is worthless, so you need to get
confirmation before Jan. 1 of your new policy either through your
employer or your insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Carry the new information in your wallet or purse. And if a
medical facility cannot confirm insurance because of Y2K problems,
you may have to pay for services out-of-pocket. But hold on to all
receipts to file for reimbursement later with your insurer, said
Anna O'Neil, spokeswoman for Blue Cross &AMP; Blue Shield of Georgia.
``Make sure you have a paper trail to follow up on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients should also try to squeeze in some face-to-face time
with any new family doctors before 2000. Doctors are unlikely to
write prescriptions for patients they have never met _ leaving you
vulnerable if there are glitches in the pharmaceutical system.
</P>
<P>
   ``So try make the time to meet them,'' said Dr. John Mersereau,
a family practitioner at the Emory Clinic. ``Or at least have your
old physicians write enough prescriptions to carry you over until
you become acquainted with the new practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Mersereau said between 1 percent and 2 percent of his patients
have requested he write extra prescriptions in response to Y2K.
``I'm trying to downplay it, because I feel comfortable that
there's not going to be any problems,'' he said. ``But I think it
makes them feel more secure.''

 &HT;    No green light for `Mile'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This movie season's Golden Globe nominations include all the big
names: Kevin Spacey, Matt Damon, Jim Carrey, Julia Roberts, Tom
Cruise, Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro. But not
Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks and his newest drama, ``The Green Mile,'' considered by
many to be a shoo-in for annual award nominations such as the
Globes and the Oscars, was nearly shut out of the Globe
nominations, announced Monday by the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association. ``The Green Mile'' got only one nod: Michael Clarke
Duncan for best supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' which details the implosion of a modern
suburban family, led all movies with six nominations, including
best drama, actor (Spacey), actress (Annette Bening), director (Sam
Mendes), screenplay (former Mariettan Alan Ball) and original score
(Thomas Newman).
</P>
<P>
   Also scoring well were Michael Mann's ``The Insider'' and
Anthony Minghella's ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' which opens in
metro Atlanta on Christmas Day. Each got five nominations,
including best dramatic actor nods for Russell Crowe and Matt
Damon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' (opening here Wednesday) and ``Being John
Malkovich,'' both associated with Michael Stipe and Athens-based
R.E.M., are up for best comedy or musical movie.
</P>
<P>
   Among other winners and losers:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where's Malkovich? John Malkovich (``Being John Malkovich'')
was bypassed in the supporting actor category. The main competitors
include ``Green Mile's'' Duncan, Cruise (``Magnolia'') and Haley
Joel Osment (``The Sixth Sense'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Double contender: Julianne Moore is up for best actress in
both drama (``The End of the Affair,'' which opens next month in
metro Atlanta) and comedy (``An Ideal Husband'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New faces: They include Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny for
``Boys Don't Cry'' and theatrical star Janet McTeer for
``Tumbleweeds.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And the familiar: Big stars receiving nominations included
Carrey (``Man on the Moon''), Roberts (``Notting Hill''),
Washington (``The Hurricane''), Streep (``Music of the Heart'') and
De Niro (``Analyze This'').
</P>
<P>
   Among the leading nominees in television categories are HBO's
``The Sopranos'' and several new series, including ABC's ``Once and
Again'' and NBC's ``The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Globes is a TV ratings bonanza, boasting 250 million
viewers worldwide. NBC recently signed a deal for exclusive rights
to the Globes' live star arrival interviews and will air this
season's ceremony Jan. 23. The rival Oscar nominations will be
announced Feb. 15.

<P>
   Coming soon, to a chip near you, your own genes.
</P>
<P>
   The biotechnology industry, which has long lived in the shadow
of Silicon Valley and envied its many overnight successes, is now
tapping into that same technology in a bid to speed up its own
growth significantly.
</P>
<P>
   These biochips look like the integrated circuits in a personal
computer, but instead of containing tiny semiconductors, they are
loaded with bits of actual DNA that make up genes or fragments of
genes. Inserted in a PC-sized analytical instrument, the chips
allow scientists to perform thousands of biochemical experiments at
a fraction of the cost and time required for traditional tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a basic tool for change in the laboratory,'' said
Michael R. Knapp, vice president for science and technology at
Caliper Technologies in Mountain View, Calif. ``We have been
operating with the test-tube paradigm for basically as long as
anybody has been doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Biochips, or microarrays, as they are also known, will bring
genomics, the study of all the genes in a living organism, out of
the research laboratory and into the daily practice of medicine. If
genomics delivers on its promise, health care will shift from a
focus on detection and treatment to a process of prediction and
prevention. Fortunes will be made.
</P>
<P>
   The initial market for the biochips has been in drug discovery,
and the major customers have been the large drug companies. By
analyzing the subtle changes that occur in genes when a cell
becomes cancerous or is infiltrated by a virus, scientists at these
companies search for new molecular targets for drugs. This
needle-in-a-haystack process could take many years using test tubes
and petri dishes but is accelerated a thousandfold by biochip
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The market for biochemical research instruments is in the
billions, and the transformational power of biochips has not gone
unnoticed by the stock market. Shares in Affymetrix, the pioneering
company in biochips, have risen more than fivefold the last year,
giving the company a market value of about $3.08 billion. Other
public companies in the field have had similar gains.
</P>
<P>
   But the biochip makers are now chasing a bigger opportunity:
personal genomics. Even as the public and private efforts to spell
out the three billion biochemical letters that make up the human
genetic code race to a conclusion, the biochip companies say they
will bring genomics to an affordable desktop system that could be
deployed in clinics and physicians' offices. Sophisticated genetic
analysis could be performed at the individual level, making
possible early prediction or detection of disease, more accurate
diagnosis and customized therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the province of a handful of start-ups backed by
venture capital and operating in a sort of gray area between
Silicon Valley and the biotech world, the biochip market has lately
attracted the attention of major electronics companies like
Motorola, Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments and IBM, all of which
have chips in development. Motorola's recent advertisements promote
the company's ``digital DNA,'' while those of Hewlett-Packard
proclaim the ``DNA of Silicon Valley.'' The message may be
metaphoric, but the market is very real.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biochip space lies at the intersection between
high-technology chip manufacturing, signal processing, software
skills and more traditional molecular biology and genomics,'' said
Nick Naclerio, vice president and general manager for Motorola's
biochip systems division. ``So it seemed right for Motorola to get
involved in what we think will ultimately be a big business.''
</P>
<P>
   The biochip companies are one of three new industries that
piggybacked on the human genome project, the multinational,
decade-old effort to identify the 100,000 or more genes _ made from
the 3 billion letters or base pairs of nucleotides _ that inform
every aspect of human biology. That project is expected to be
completed within a year or two, either by the national labs or
private companies or, as seems most likely, a combination of the
two.
</P>
<P>
   Genomics companies like Human Genome Sciences, Millennium
Pharmaceuticals, Incyte Pharmaceuticals &UR;  &LR; and the Celera Genomics
Group of the PE &UR;  &LR; Corp. rushed to beat the public effort by finding
and patenting genes of medical utility. Bioinformatics companies,
like DoubleTwist.com and Informax, offer software to interpret
genomic data. The chip companies, led by Affymetrix, based in Santa
Clara, Calif., offer a tool to automate the arduous lab work of
biochemical research _ and maybe to do much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to burn a set of chips with the whole human
genome,'' said Stephen P.A. Fodor, president and chief executive of
Affymetrix. Fodor headed a group that pioneered the field of
biochips, with a 1991 paper in the journal Science describing how
photolithography, the standard process by which semiconductor
companies etch circuits in silicon, could also be used to
synthesize biological materials on a chip.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Eli Lilly, SmithKline Beecham and American Home
Products have been eagerly buying Affymetrix's GeneChip arrays,
helping to increase the company's revenues in the first nine months
of this year to $65.7 million, from $35.8 million in the comparable
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Often lost in the excitement about the completion of the genome
project is that the first human genome will be a consensus, culled
from the DNA samples of dozens of anonymous donors. The sequence of
each gene will be arrived at only after billions of taxpayer
dollars and a decade of study in laboratories lined with $300,000
gene-sequencing machines and other elaborate devices. What the
makers of biochips promise is to offer that same depth of
information at the individual level and at low cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as as the reference DNA is out there, this will move
in a thousand different directions,'' Fodor said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most of the chip companies agree that the next big
application will be the interpretation of how genetic diversity
affects the efficacy and side effects of drugs, a field known as
pharmacogenetics. The idea is to use the chips to spot genetic
differences known as single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs
(pronounced SNIPS), because they consist of a misspelling of just
one letter of the genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   A typical person has thousands of SNPs, most of which are
inconsequential, but some can predispose one to a disease, or to
adverse drug reactions. As researchers discover new SNPs every day,
``SNPs on Chips'' has become a rallying cry for the biochip
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this SNP enterprise becomes what people think it might, you
can imagine having an infant tested at birth and given a chip, and
a result that says you are susceptible to diseases A, B and C,''
said Mark Schena, who did early research on biochips while studying
at Stanford and is now a visiting scholar at TeleChem
International, a biochip company in Sunnyvale, Calif. ``Based on
this knowledge you can make appropriate lifestyle changes to
prevent the disease or delay its onset''
</P>
<P>
   Such testing, of course, raises many ethical question. Biochip
companies are working on encryption technology to keep such data
private, but most industry executives believe that legislation will
be necessary to prevent abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Because the chip companies are all chasing similar markets _ and
in part because Affymetrix's early lead allowed it to lock up
patents on many of the ways to put DNA on chips _ they are
distinguishing their offerings by using different technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Caliper and Orchid Biocomputer have added
microfluidics, a complex network of tiny valves and capillaries
that allow researchers to move liquids on and off the chip.
Nanogen, based in San Diego, incorporates both microfluidics and
electronic circuitry on its chip, to allow researchers to create
their own custom microarrays. And Aclara Biosciences of Mountain
View, Calif., uses plastic cards instead of glass chips or silicon
chips, to keep its devices cheap and disposable.
</P>
<P>
   Orchid, based in Princeton, N.J., has been chosen to perform
testing on genetic markers identified by the SNP Consortium, a
group of 10 pharmaceuticals companies and five academic centers,
which expects to find and publish 300,000 SNPs the next two years.
Next year, Orchid plans to start GeneShield.com, a Web-based
business that will allow consumers to send their own DNA samples,
gathered with a simple cheek swab, for analysis against chips
loaded with reference SNPs associated with known diseases or drug
interactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of SNPs being scored now is a horrendous Moore's
Law,'' said Dale Pfost, Orchid's president and chief executive,
referring to the observation by the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore
that the number of devices on a chip would double every 18 months.
``Genetic diversity is a whole new industry that people don't know
exists,'' Pfost said. ``We're enabling that industry.''
</P>
<P>
   As biochips move from the research laboratory to the clinic, the
technology must not only achieve something approaching absolute
accuracy but also far higher levels of what the industry calls
throughput, meaning the number of tests that can be conducted
rapidly or simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, evaluating the 300,000 SNPs promised by the consortium
in 1,000 people would mean performing 300 million different tests,
and any single mistake might create a serious health risk. ``You
need an industrial technology for that,'' said Hubert Koster, the
chief executive of Sequenom, a San Diego biochip company. ``You
cannot use a technology that is 99.9 percent accurate. In the
research world that would be OK, but not in the industrial world
because it would give you 300,000 errors.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step will be even more challenging. If biochips are
also to aid in quick diagnosis of disease, they need the ability to
follow the trail from a gene, which instructs a cell to make a
given protein, to the actual proteins produced within the body.
Unfortunately, proteins are harder to label and measure then the
DNA itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proteins are the molecular equivalent of a symptom, and
your proteins get altered long before you go to a doctor,'' said
William Rich, president and chief executive of Ciphergen Biosystems
in Palo Alto, Calif., which has developed a protein chip and
associated instruments. ``We think the impact on diagnostics will
be huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Schena at TeleChem International agrees. ``Biochips started out
with a lot of diagnostics but sort of drifted away from that as
reality set in and the pharmaceuticals industry was so needy,'' he
said. ``But it will come back. If so, the market is probably in
excess of $10 billion a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Some biochip companies are looking well beyond medical
applications: genetic diversity also accounts for people's
different perceptions of taste and smell. Indeed, Affymetrix
already counts a candy manufacturer and a cosmetics company among
its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at a map of the genome, what you see are markers
for dysfunction,'' Fodor said. ``It's a real marketing failure.
Let's look at new applications like fragrance or taste. There are
going to be a lot of fun things.'' &QL;

AFTER CHANGE OF HEART, TURKEY VEERS TOWARD EUROPE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The mood was jubilant on the night Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit announced that Turkey would begin drawing
closer to the European Union, but one news reporter almost spoiled
it with an indiscreet question.
</P>
<P>
   ``You blocked this country's way to Europe once,'' he called
out. ``What made you decide not to do it again?''
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit ignored the question, but it reflected a remarkable
political transition whose effect is reverberating across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   During all of his more than 40 years in politics, Ecevit has
described himself as a leftist. When he was prime minister in the
1970s, he brusquely rejected the offer by the predecessor of
today's European Union to consider Turkey as a candidate, scorning
it as an imperialist plot.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that decision, Turkey was left outside the
European family while its major rival, Greece, joined in 1981 and
rode quickly to prosperity and solid democracy.
</P>
<P>
   When Ecevit, now 75, returned to power this year, some voters
feared that he would again obstruct Turkey's progress toward
Europe. Instead he has done just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   For months Ecevit has been steadily steering Turkey on a
pro-European course, promising many reforms and even enacting some.
He has managed to squelch opposition not only in his own party, but
also among his right-wing coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit's quiet campaign was crowned with success in
mid-December, when the European Union named Turkey as a ``candidate
state.'' This onetime firebrand, still describing himself as a
leftist but now convinced that Turks belong in Europe, has the task
of leading them there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that he feels responsible and
guilty for what he did,'' said Ishak Alaton, a pro-European
businessman. ``This was a chance for him to change that bad
decision, and that's what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, Greece's fragile new democracy applied for
membership. Leaders of the European group thought that to be fair,
they should also offer Turkey a chance to apply. But Ecevit refused
the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit was then trying to stake out an independent path for
Turkey, and he often denounced what he called the colonialist
designs of Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He was encouraged in his anti-Europe sentiment by owners of
subsidized businesses, who feared disaster if they were made to
compete with European companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw the European community as a capitalist
organization,'' said Cetin Altan, an author and social commentator
who is of Ecevit's generation. ``It was a time when concepts like
democracy, economy, state and nation were not very well understood
in Turkey. Now they are seen more clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit has not spoken publicly about his actions of 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   When a recent interviewer asked him if he regretted rejecting
Europe then, he replied that he would leave the verdict to history.
</P>
<P>
   He may see the coming months as a period in which he can change
the way he is remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that this candidacy came up while Ecevit, who is
known as a Euro-skeptic, was in office,'' said one European
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really had no choice other than to accept it. When he did,
that reassured the establishment and made the whole idea more
convincing.''

 &HT;    Plaintiffs looking to add names to Coke lawsuit
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The plaintiffs in a racial discrimination lawsuit
against Coca-Cola want to add more employees and allegations to
their federal complaint seeking class-action status.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed Monday asking for court permission to amend
the suit, the plaintiffs claim Chairman and Chief Executive M.
Douglas Ivester and other senior managers have known about
``company-wide discrimination against African-Americans'' since at
least 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``This knowledge places full responsibility for current
violations of federal anti-discrimination law at the highest levels
of the company,'' the revised suit alleges. ``Despite
well-documented racial disparities, Ivester and other members of
Coca-Cola's senior management have consistently failed to take
their equal opportunity obligations seriously enough to correct
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which strongly denied the allegations in the previous
version of the lawsuit, said Monday that it has not had time to
review the revised suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received the plaintiffs' amended filing late this
afternoon, and it would be inappropriate to comment further until
we've had a chance to study it more closely,'' said company
spokesman Ben Deutsch.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch did say that the company was taking the allegations of
the four new plaintiffs in the revised suit ``very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the revised suit, which claims that
African-Americans have been discriminated against in pay,
promotions and performance evaluations, seek to represent more than
2,000 black salaried employees in the United States. That number is
up from 1,500 employees in the previous complaint.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard Story will eventually decide whether
to certify the case as a class-action, but that decision will not
be made for at least several months.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the plaintiffs are seeking Story's permission
to add four current or former employees to the four plaintiffs who
filed the previous version of the lawsuit in late April.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the new plaintiffs have worked for Coca-Cola in Atlanta:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ajibola Laosebikan, an information systems specialist, alleges
that he effectively went eight years without a promotion, while
white employees with less experience, education or seniority
advanced more rapidly than he did. He also alleges he was
wrongfully terminated last month in retaliation for making
complaints about race discrimination and after attending a hearing
in this case.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wanda Williams, an assistant scientist who has been working at
Coca-Cola for about 15 years, alleges that she has been denied
promotions because of her race. She also says she has been treated
differently than her white counterparts in performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The other new plaintiffs have worked at the Minute Maid Co. in
Houston, which Coca-Cola owns:
</P>
<P>
   _ Elvenyia Barton-Gibson, who has worked at Minute Maid since
1996, is currently employed as an executive assistant to the chief
marketing officer. She alleges that she has been denied the chance
to compete for promotions. Barton-Gibson also alleges that eight
other African-American marketing professionals were terminated or
left in frustration over their inability to advance.
</P>
<P>
   _ George Eddings Jr. is a former Minute Maid employee who left
the company in 1997 after he said he was denied a long-promised
promotion. He had worked for the company for five years, most
recently as a category development manager.
</P>
<P>
   The revised suit claims that senior management has not corrected
discriminatory practices that have been brought to its attention
from inside and outside Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the suit cited a report by Carl Ware, the most
senior African-American executive at the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Ivester received the Ware Report documenting. . .
barriers to the advancement of African-Americans at Coca-Cola in
1995, more than four years later, Coca-Cola admits that it has
failed to fully implement the report's recommendations,'' the suit
alleges. Those recommendations reportedly included executive
accountability for improved diversity results and increasing the
hiring of African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Ware, who heads the company's operations in Africa, now
co-chairs a Diversity Advisory Council set up by Ivester after the
previous version of the suit was filed in April. Ware, however,
plans to retire at the end of next year. That decision came in the
wake of a management restructuring in which Ware no longer reports
to Ivester. The revised suit also alleges the company has failed to
fulfill ``most of its obligations'' under an agreement it reached
with the government about certain violations of federal
affirmative-action regulations governing federal contractors, such
as Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   At Minute Maid, the suit claims, an internal consultant
concluded in 1997 that there were problems of racial discrimination
and that the company ``had a reputation as a poor place for
African-Americans to work.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time the plaintiffs have tried to amend the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   The initial suit was filed in December 1998 by Gregory Allen
Clark, who is employed as a security officer in Atlanta. He was
joined in April by three other current or former employees in
Atlanta: Motisola Malikha Abdallah, currently an administrative
assistant; Linda Ingram, currently an information systems analyst;
and Kimberly Gray Orton, a former director.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and a court order
preventing the company from engaging in the alleged discriminatory
practices.

NEWS ANALYSIS: RUSSIAN VOTERS STAND BEHIND WAR AND DEMOCRACY
</HEADLINE>
   (With RUSSIA-ELECT) 
(jw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The West has long seen the development of democracy in
Russia as a check against the Kremlin's military ambitions and a
way to bridge the political divide between East and West.
</P>
<P>
   But consider the results of Russia's parliamentary elections:
millions of Russians went to the polls and demonstrated their
support for the war in Chechnya, despite its apparent brutality, by
voting for candidates backed by Vladimir Putin, the hawkish prime
minister closely associated with the military drive in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments, especially the United States, have run into
many difficulties in trying to deal with the new Russia: corrupt
tycoons, die-hard Communists and an enfeebled president. But now
they have found themselves squarely at odds with the Russian
public.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread backing for the war _ and Putin's personal
popularity, which soared as the situation in Chechnya got more
brutal _ not only reduces the already minuscule chance for a
political accommodation in Chechnya. It also suggests a broader
shift in Russian public sentiment toward a more nationalist, if
pro-capitalist stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin will take this as an endorsement of his policy and wage
the war even more fiercely,'' said Andrei Piontkovsky, a political
analyst. ``Democracy is not a guarantee against many nasty
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, many Russians had reason to be concerned that
Chechnya had turned into a lawless region of marauders and
kidnappers. The trouble in the Caucasus began in August when
Islamic military forces stormed into neighboring Dagestan. Later,
terrorists blew up apartment houses in Moscow, acts for which most
Russians believe the Chechen militants were somehow responsible.
</P>
<P>
   And it is also true that there is something old and powerful in
the Russian political psyche that hankers for a strongman: a
political leader who can bring the country's disputatious regions
to heel, force people to work, and ensure that pensions are paid on
time. As a former intelligence chief, untainted by allegations of
corruption and relatively new to politics, Putin seems to fit that
bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the way in which the current Chechnya campaign was turned
into a major election-year asset, with a largely sympathetic
Russian press playing down reports of civilian and military
casualties while highlighting the army's heroic advances on the
battlefield, was not supposed to be in the democracy lesson book.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Russian and Soviet military operations were
perceived by the West as the adventures of secretive cabals, which
the public would oppose if only it could. When the Soviet Union
invaded Afghanistan, Western governments assailed the Politburo,
and when the Yeltsin government dispatched the Russian army into
Grozny during the 1994-96 war, critics blamed a small Kremlin
clique.
</P>
<P>
   This time, whether the Chechnya campaign is considered a just
fight against terrorism or a politically expedient war that has
needlessly endangered civilians, it is different in this respect:
many Russians believe it is necessary and, as in any democratic
society, share in the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The election returns indicate as much. The Unity party, which
received 23 per cent of the votes cast for political parties, was
established by the Kremlin only several months ago. What gave it
strength was in Putin's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The Union of Right Forces, a pro-capitalist group, also did
better than expected with 9 percent. Led by Sergei Kiriyenko, a
former prime minister, its prospects received an enormous boost
when Putin publicly praised its economic program.
</P>
<P>
   Few voters probably knew what the economic program consisted of,
but the campaign ads of a smiling Kiriyenko meeting with Putin was
enough to bring in the votes.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the only party that even remotely challenged the
wisdom of the war, the Yabloko party of Grigory Yavlinsky, fared
poorly in the polls, garnering only 6 per cent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a chance to change the situation in 1999,''
Yavlinsky said ruefully Sunday night. ``But it did not happen. War,
it seems, is a narcotic that can drown out all political
problems.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The poll results presented a mixed message for the West. The
good news was that success of Unity and the Union of Right Forces
broke Communist control over the parliament. That in turn increased
the prospects for new legislation to encourage investment and
reform the tax system.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news was that Russian's economic reformers are no longer
the fair-haired boys they used to be, at least in the eyes of the
West. To boost their parliamentary fortunes, they talked tougher
than Russia's most hard-line generals and turned a deaf ear to the
Western officials they once courted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Destruction of terrorism in Chechnya is, of course, the basis
of continued support for Putin,'' Anatoly Chubais, the former
Kremlin aide and architect of the Union of Right Forces' strategy,
declared.
</P>
<P>
   And much of the Russian public seems to be downright hostile to
Western opinion, at least if the voting results are any guide.
Having urged Russia to embrace democracy, however, Western
spokesman could only applaud the elections _ if not the message it
sent regarding the war.
</P>
<P>
   That will not necessarily stop Washington from complaining about
Russian policy on Chechnya. But it left official spokesmen in
Washington groping for a response Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says something about the system in Russia, where elections
are becoming more common, where the turnout is so strong and the
democratic institutions, regardless of, you know, what you think of
who won and who lost, have become accepted as the norm, and that's
a positive,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the election results, and their endorsement of the
Chechnya policy, would make it harder for the United States to
bring pressure to bear on the Kremlin over the war, Lockhart said:
``Well, I don't know. I mean, obviously the domestic political
audience may view it different than the international community
does.''

CONEXANT BUYS SOFTWARE DESIGNER MAKER COMMUNICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maker Communications Inc. which develops software that enables
engineers to create semiconductors essential to Internet
communications, has agreed to be acquired by Conexant Systems Inc.
for $942.8 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Conexant, of Newport Beach, Calif., will
pay $43.76 per Maker share, based on Conexant's closing price
Monday of $66 5/16. That works out to 0.66 shares of Conexant for
each Maker share.
</P>
<P>
   The price is 28 percent higher than the Maker's 34 1/4 closing
price on Friday, the date both companies used in calculating the
value of the stock deal.
</P>
<P>
   Maker's stock soared 7 1/2 points to close at 41 3/4. Conexant
shares dropped 3 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Maker, which went public in May, is little known outside the
semiconductor industry and is one of the few New England
chip-design software firms. Maker's software enables engineers to
create devices that process and switch data, voice and video in
communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year-old Framingham, Mass. company's software is used
in communications systems, including switches and network access
products. The company's software enables customers to develop
high-speed, programmable, custom-designed chips for these and
devices that can help speed up the flow and delivery of information
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For Conexant, which was spun off from Rockwell International
Corp. a year ago to focus on developing communications devices, the
pending acquisition of Maker is ``a strategic bullseye,'' said
Dwight W. Decker, Conexant's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In a teleconference, William N. Giudice, Maker president and
chief executive, said no layoffs are planned, adding that company
plans to expand employment in Massachusetts from 80 people to 130
by the end of next year. Giudice will stay on as head of Framingham
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Maker will be part of Conexant's network access division. The
Maker software will be marketed by Conexant's 250-person sales
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Conexant we can grow faster,'' said Giudice.
</P>
<P>
   Both Conexant and Maker produce chips and software for customers
such as as Cisco Systems Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Maker's incoming owners have ambitous plans for the
small software company. Decker said he expects to expand Maker's
business to reach annualized revenue of about $100 million by the
end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That's a sizable gain. Maker earned $830,000 on revenues of $4.1
milliun in the third quarter. Net income for the first nine months
of 1999 was $1.3 million on sales of $10.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Conexant, whose sales doubled to $277.9 million in fiscal 1999
which ended in September, said the Maker deal will reduce its
profit by as much as one cent a share in fiscal 2000.

KAZUO SAKAMAKI,   PACIFIC POW NO. 1, DIES AT 81  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan, Brazil, Fla . , Texas)   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kazuo Sakamaki, who became the first Japanese prisoner of war
captured by American forces in World War II when his midget
submarine ran aground during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor,
died on Nov. 29. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   His death, in Japan, was reported Monday by a Japanese veterans'
group.
</P>
<P>
   A midget submarine of the Japanese Imperial Navy carrying Ensign
Sakamaki and Chief Warrant Officer Kiyoshi Inagaki was launched
from a mother submarine 10 miles off Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, at 3:33
a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941. About four and a half hours later,
Japanese bombers attacked the U.S. Pacific Fleet, plunging America
into World War II. But Sakamaki was frustrated by mechanical
misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   His 78.5-foot-long submarine, HA-19, and four other midget subs,
each armed with a pair of 1,000-pound torpedoes, were to attack
American destroyers or battleships.
</P>
<P>
   But Sakamaki's gyrocompass, which had given him trouble even
before the mission began, continued to malfunction, causing his
submarine to run in circles while at periscope depth. He struck
submerged coral reefs three times, then surfaced just after 8 a.m.
_ moments after the Japanese bombers' first wave _ and ran aground.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine was spotted by an American destroyer, the Helm,
which fired at it. The shots missed, but they blasted the submarine
off the reef and knocked Sakamaki unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   After he revived, Sakamaki tried to get his submarine going. It
managed to avoid American depth charges, but the firing mechanisms
for its torpedoes were damaged. The submarine became partially
flooded, it filled with smoke and fumes from its batteries, causing
the two crewmen to pass out.
</P>
<P>
   Sakamaki revived once again late Sunday night, opened the hatch,
noted that he was near land and tried to run his submarine onto a
stretch of beach, but the engines died, and the submarine grounded
on yet another coral reef.
</P>
<P>
   After ordering Inagaki to abandon the submarine, Sakamaki lit
the fuses of the self-destruct charges and leaped into the surf.
The charges did not explode, and the other crewman drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Sakamaki reached a stretch of beach, but fell unconscious once
more. When he awakened the next morning, an American soldier, Sgt.
David Akui, was standing over him. Sakamaki was the only crewman to
survive from the midget submarines. All five were lost, and none
were known to have caused damage to American ships.
</P>
<P>
   Sakamaki was questioned at nearby Fort Shafter, then sent to a
prisoner of war camp in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the war, he returned to Japan and wrote his
memoirs, ``Four Years as a Prisoner-of-War, No. 1,'' in which he
told of receiving mail from some Japanese denouncing him for not
having committed suicide when it appeared he could be taken
captive. His memoirs were published in the United States on the
eighth anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack with the title, ``I
Attacked Pearl Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sakamaki became a businessman, serving as president of a
Brazilian subsidiary of Toyota and then working for a
Toyota-affiliated company in Japan before retiring in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife and two children.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His submarine was salvaged by American troops, shipped to the
United States in January 1942, and taken on a nationwide tour to
sell War Bonds. It was placed on display at a submarine base in Key
West, Fla., in 1947 and later transferred in 1990 to its current
site, the Admiral Nimitz Museum in Fredericksburg, Texas, in 1991,
Sakamaki paid a visit to his old sub during a symposium on the
Pearl Harbor attack.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow Japanese naval veteran, Sadaichi Fukui, said that
although Sakamaki wrote his memoirs, he did not speak much about
his war experiences. As Fukui put it, ``I think he had a lot of
feelings he could not put in words about becoming the first
prisoner of war at a time when falling into the hands of the enemy
was the biggest shame.''

BELL ATLANTIC, UNIONS GIRD FOR UPCOMING TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years after a strike by 12,000 Nynex Corp. workers crippled
telephone service, Bell Atlantic's biggest unions say they are
bracing for a fight next year over the key issues of managed care
and organizing rights at the company's nonunion mobile wireless
units.
</P>
<P>
   The Communications Workers of America and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 2222 launched their
strategy sessions last week with a demonstration outside Bell
Altantic headquarters in Boston that drew some 700 union members.
Together, the two unions represent more than 14,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is a possibility of a confrontation and we want
to be ready,'' said CWA representative Steve Early. ``The earlier
we mobilize, the more prepared we'll be.'' Talks are not scheduled
to begin until August.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic spokesman Steve Marcus said he could not discuss
upcoming talks. ``Our policy is we discuss issues like this at the
bargaining table,'' he said. ``At the appropriate time we will sit
down with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although neither union mentioned the possibility of a strike,
Myles Calvey, business agent at IBEW Local 2222, said both unions
are preparing early for a possible job action. The unions chose
this month to begin mobilizing members because it marked the
10-year anniversary of the 1989 strike that disrupted service in
the region for 100 days. That strike, like upcoming talks, centered
around health benefits and job security.
</P>
<P>
   This time, a key issue among union officials is a company
proposal that would require workers switch from the current
indemnity health plan to a managed care plan now being used by
two-thirds of Bell Atlantic's workers. The indemnity plan had been
part of a negotiated agreement with the former Nynex Corp., which
merged with Bell Atlantic in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Union-represented employees in New England and New York have
an indemnity plan that allows you to go to any doctor and we pay
for that,'' confirmed Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Such plans are now rare among corporations. A study of 1,020 US
firms by Hewitt Associates, a benefits consultancy based in
Lincolnshire, Ill., revealed that only three percent still carry
indemnity health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The IBEW's Calvey said another key concern is the expansion of
Bell Atlantic's mobile units. Currently, about 7,000 workers are
employed by Bell Atlantic mobile units. Of those, however, only 50
are unionized.
</P>
<P>
   The IBEW, responding to predictions of massive growth of the
wireless units in coming years, says it will seek the right to
organize the units without interference from the company.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Bell Atlantic Mobile and Vodafone Group PLC of
Britain solidified a joint venture expected to make Bell Atlantic
the biggest wireless carrier in the country, with an estimated 20
million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bell Atlantic is combined with the wireless subsidiaries
that are part of the Bell-GTE merger and when the wireless holdings
of a joint venture with Vodafone are added, we will see an even
larger wireless company and it will be nonunion,'' said Early.
</P>
<P>
   Added Calvey, ``These are future jobs. Our ability to continue
to negotiate good contracts will be undermined if the fastest
growing segment of the company _ the wireless segment _ remains
nonunion.''

DNA TESTS MAY SOLVE 200-YEAR-OLD MYSTERY OF LOUIS XVII 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ At the height of the French Revolution, the little
prince was imprisoned with his parents, Louis XVI and Marie
Antoinette. Soon, however, the king and his brioche-loving queen
went to the guillotine. The 8-year-old prince, who became Louis
XVII, was left alone locked up in the Temple prison _ kept in the
dark for long stretches, uncared for and barely fed.
</P>
<P>
   On this much, historians agree. But there is much in dispute
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional history has held that the little boy, his body
riddled with tumors and encrusted with scabies sores, finally died
of tuberculosis at the age of 10. But some have held that the dead
boy was an impostor. The real king, they say, was at some point
spirited out of the prison by supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has spawned more than 100 pretenders to the throne.
In 1845, one such man, Charles-Guillaume Naundorff, was buried in
the Netherlands, his tombstone reading: ``Here lies the king of
France.'' Experts on the royal family say there are still dozens
more claiming to be direct descendants, though few have been as
public with their claims.
</P>
<P>
   But now an answer to the mystery may be possible. Last week,
scientists began examining a heart kept in a crystal urn in the
royal crypt at the Basilica of St.-Denis north of Paris _
supposedly the heart of the young boy who died in 1795. Their aim
is to compare DNA from the heart with DNA in strands of Marie
Antoinette's hair.
</P>
<P>
   In a small but formal ceremony, the transparent urn was draped
with a purple cloth and taken across Paris to a laboratory where
scientists used a razor blade to slice two small pieces of the
heart. The pieces were then placed in sealed envelopes to be sent
to Germany and Belgium where two different laboratories will
attempt the same analysis. The results are expected by February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had the heart for a while,'' said the Duke de
Beauffremont, who heads the Memorial of France at St.-Denis, the
private organization that oversees the royal graves. ``But the
techniques were not as good as they are today. To do these tests is
a very obvious thing to do. It is a very important issue for
France. There are so many hypotheses about what happened. Now,
maybe we will know, once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting the answer may not be easy. First, many questions
surround the authenticity of the heart, which was brought to the
royal crypt only in 1975. Before that, it had a long and
complicated odyssey, having been stolen, returned, refused, fought
over and passed on in various ways over the last two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   This tortuous journey means that getting enough DNA material
from the heart may be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been preserved under the best circumstances for
these sorts of tests, by any means,'' said Jean-Jacques Cassiman, a
scientist at the Center for Human Genetics at Louvain University in
Belgium, who will be supervising tests there. ``Whether we will be
able to do an analysis is hard to say. We will try. It's all we can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how the heart was preserved is not a scientist's
dream. Those who say the heart is from the child who died in 1795
believe this version of events: When the child in the Temple died,
an autopsy was performed and one of the physicians present,
Philippe-Jean Pelletan, decided he wanted a souvenir: When the
others weren't looking he tucked the heart into his handkerchief
and took it home. There he put it in a glass vial filled with
alcohol. Unfortunately, the liquid evaporated and the heart dried
up. A few years later, one of the doctor's assistants stole it. But
when he died, his widow returned it to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   When the monarchy was briefly returned to power in 1815, the
doctor apparently tried to return the heart to Louis XVIII, who
wanted nothing to do with it. So, just before he died, Pelletan
decided to entrust it to the archbishop of Paris. In 1831, however,
the archbishop's palace came under attack during civil disorders,
and a printer named Lescroart tried to save the relic and the
paperwork that proved its authenticity in the hopes of giving it
back to the doctor's son for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   He was caught in the mayhem, however, and as he tussled with a
national guardsman the crystal urn containing the heart was
smashed. Later, when all was quiet, Lescroart came back with
Pelletan's son and they found the heart lying among shards of
glass, some engraved with the royal fleurs de lys. The son kept the
heart until his death. In his will, he bequeathed it to members of
one of the branches of France's royal family, who kept it in their
chateau for more than eight decades. In 1975, was it put into the
custody of the Memorial for France at St.-Denis.
</P>
<P>
   Cassiman has already tried to solve another royal mystery, that
of the real identity of Naundorff. Last year, he published a paper
in the European Journal of Human Genetics saying that DNA analysis
showed that it was highly unlikely that Naundorff was related to
Marie Antoinette.
</P>
<P>
   Naundorff turned up in Berlin around 1810 claiming he was the
French heir, apparently providing enough details about the Court of
Versailles to be convincing. He came to France in 1833, was exiled
by the French, lived in London for a while and then died in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Cassiman and his associates compared DNA material taken from
Naundorff's body with hair from the queen and two of her sisters
that was found in lockets that had belonged to their mother. They
found no matches.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The French Revolution, and its many aftershocks, wiped out a
great many royals and stripped most of them of their wealth. A
major split among them began in 1830, 16 years after the Bourbons
were restored to the throne: A crisis forced King Charles X to
abdicate, and his cousin the Duke of Orleans took over, ruling as
King Louis-Philippe until the revolution of 1848.
</P>
<P>
   When the last French Bourbon heir died in 1883, the Orleans
family, according to experts in such matters, could rightfully
claim the French crown if France ever decided to restore the
monarchy. But Bourbon loyalists counter with a claim for Prince
Louis of Spain, a descendant of the grandson of King Louis XIV of
France who founded the Spanish branch of the Bourbon family in the
18th century.
</P>
<P>
   The French are not all that interested in their royalty,
although there is enough interest to keep at least one
royal-watchers' magazine, Point de Vue, afloat.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Duke de Beauffremont said, he has known
quite a few people who claimed to be direct descendants of Louis
XVII, most of them dead now. ``These people were not crazy,'' the
duke said. ``They made very convincing cases. One was a professor
at a university. One was an engineer. They were very, very sure of
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The duke said he would like the heart to be that of Louis XVII,
but he acknowledged that even if the DNA did not match, many people
could ``go on dreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very mysterious subject and one that invokes great
passions,'' he said.

REPORT CONDEMNS BUSINESS INFLUENCE ON L.A. TIMES NEWS PAGES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   With reputations _ and perhaps careers _ hanging in the balance,
the Los Angeles Times Monday published an extraordinarily detailed
37,000-word postmortem by staff media writer David Shaw on the
paper's credibility- and morale-sapping Staples Center episode.
</P>
<P>
   At a paper where Times-Mirror CEO Mark Willes has preached the
virtues of tearing down the ``wall'' between business and editorial
departments, Shaw blamed the fiasco on ``deadened sensibilities and
diminished standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy exploded in October, after several papers
reported that the Times had devoted an Oct. 10 issue of its
magazine to coverage of the new Staples Center sports arena, under
a deal to share revenues with the center. As word spread, there was
almost a newsroom revolt; about 300 staff members signed a petition
asking that publisher Kathryn Downing apologize and undertake a
review of Times policy.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper becoming business partners with an institution that
is a subject of continuing news coverage is what Shaw described as
a ``flagrant . . . violation of the journalistic principle of
editorial independence.'' It is also emblematic of a newspaper
industry _ driven by stock prices and frightened by declining
circulation, aging readers and the Internet _ reaching out for new
revenue streams. One result may be near-toxic levels of distrust: a
recent survey by the American Society of Newspaper Editors found
that half the respondents believed papers allow advertisers to
influence news, and that almost 60 percent thought papers were more
concerned with profits than with the public good.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a day before Shaw's story appeared, Downing and
editor Michael Parks apologized for the Staples Center episode, and
the paper published a list of Times principles. Included was the
statement that ``we will remain free of associations and activities
that might compromise our integrity or damage our credibility . . .
If the editorial mission and the commercial interests of the Times
conflict, editorial integrity will always come first.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, observers expressed relief that the paper had produced a
full and independent airing of the controversy. ``Finally, there's
a complete and exhaustive analysis of what took place,'' said the
Times senior projects editor, Kit Rachlis.
</P>
<P>
   Downing issued a statement saying, ``We believe we must be able
to shine as bright a light on ourselves as we do others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is a commendable first step,'' said the Nieman
Foundation curator, Bill Kovach. ``The question is `what's next?' I
never had any real doubt about the journalism inside the newsroom
of the LA Times. My doubt has always been about (the business
practices) since Mark Willes has come in and tried to change the
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shaw reconstruction of events is critical of Downing's
judgment and of Parks's failure to act more decisively to protect
editorial integrity. But it lays the brunt of the blame on the
changes that Willes imposed on that culture with his bottom-line
orientation and his desire for closer cooperation between editorial
and business departments.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining how the Staples episode might have occurred, Shaw
wrote that ``so many in the newsroom had become so inured to
intrusions by business side considerations in the editorial process
that they were desensitized and demoralized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the largest single chapter in the piece is called
`The Wall,' '' Shaw said in an interview Monday. The Times culture
had ``created a climate in which people kind of shrugged their
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's report suggested that Downing, the Willes protege who
became Times publisher this year, did not have the journalistic
experience to recognize the pitfalls of the Staples deal and was
``ill-served by her senior team.'' He quoted Times executives as
saying that ``without more experienced hands willing to challenge
her . . . a blunder like the Staples deal was inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Parks, Shaw asked the Watergate-era question: ``What did he
know and when did he know it?'' In the report, Parks acknowledged
first having heard about and having raised objections to the
Staples profit-sharing plan in mid-September, when the magazine was
at the printer. But Shaw pointed out that Parks and Downing still
had time to cancel the press run, or put some kind of public
disclaimer on the magazine, and failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In Shaw's story, Parks acknowledged: ``I underestimated the
impact of the Staples arrangement on our credibility, on the
journalistic ethos that we foster, on our standing in the community
and in the profession. And for all those things, I have profound
regret.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the report saves its most damning indictment for the
influence of the Willes philosophy at the paper. ``Increasingly,''
Shaw wrote, ``business concerns seemed to be influencing editorial
decisions in ways long forbidden at the Times.'' The report noted
that the agreement between the Times and Staples Center that led to
the revenue-sharing deal had been negotiated by the general manager
of the paper's sports section _ a position created as part of
Willes's plan to match business-side executives with editorial
sections.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talked about bringing the walls down, what we should
have done . . . is to develop an explicit set of principles, rules
of engagement, whatever you want to call it,'' Willes told Shaw.
And along with publishing its principles, the Times also
distributed a list of guidelines to its employees on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   One relevant guideline notes that ``if the publisher decides to
enter into joint ventures, partnerships or sponsorships with other
organizations, the publisher will fully and promptly disclose the
nature of these relationships to the editor. Disclosure to readers
is always required when The Times covers stories that deal with
these organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Monday, Shaw said: ``I deliberately, in this
piece, did not speculate on the future of anybody.'' But one
high-ranking Times editor said, ``Michael and Kathryn and Mark
Willes in very different ways, are being held accountable for what
happened.'' And there is open speculation about whether Downing,
and particularly Parks, will survive the fallout from the Staples
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some observers wondered whether Monday's report would
become a convenient closing chapter in the scandal, or a catalyst
for real reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue now is Shaw's piece and the articulation of
principles,'' said Tom Rosenstiel, a former Times staff member and
director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism. Is it ``an
attempt to put this behind them and forget about it? Or is it an
attempt to say, let's not forget about it, let's build on it?''

<P>
   A penny is not worth much nowadays except, oddly enough, on Wall
Street. There, a penny a share in company earnings can mean the
difference between a stock that soars and one that skids.
</P>
<P>
   The punishment that stocks regularly endure from investors
disappointed over the tiniest earnings misses has put managements
under pressure to deliver upbeat earnings announcements even if the
numbers do not support them. The result, according to some Wall
Street accounting experts, is a disturbing trend. More and more
companies, they say, are going to extremes to paint a rosy picture
of their operations.
</P>
<P>
   That picture tends to make stock prices jump. Only later does a
more accurate portrayal emerge in filings with regulators. By then,
though, investors usually have been swayed by analysts'
exhortations and are no longer paying close attention.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors say the trend and the pressures on companies to
perform well has made news distributed by companies in news
releases and conference calls with analysts increasingly suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Such pressure was evident recently as James H. Hance Jr., vice
chairman and chief financial officer of Bank of America, prepared
to deliver the bank's third-quarter results to Wall Street. The
bank's stock was under siege. In the week before the Oct. 18
earnings announcement, the shares lost 13.9 percent of their value,
falling to a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
   Happily for Hance, he had positive news for investors that
Monday. For the third quarter of 1999, Bank of America's net income
more than doubled to $2.15 billion from the comparable period in
1998. Because the bank had for weeks been quietly advising analysts
to reduce their estimates, investors breathed a sigh of relief when
the company's results exceeded the reduced expectations. The shares
rose 22 percent by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   But little more than three weeks later, the bank's quarterly
earnings statement was filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and it contained a surprise. A footnote to the
financial data contradicted a statement made by the bank's vice
chairman on that important October conference call and showed that
a one-time gain had helped the bank _ the nation's second largest
in terms of assets, after Citigroup _ meet Wall Street's earnings
estimates. Since one-time gains do not represent continuing
operations, investors view them as less compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy between what was said on the conference call and
what came out in the regulatory filing has caused a stir among
analysts on Wall Street. Executives have always tried to put the
best face on their reports to analysts, investors and the public.
But some analysts feel that Bank of America went further,
misleading them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have always been companies willing to do this, but the
practice is now more widespread and is being seen at even the most
respected of firms,'' said Charles Peabody, a bank stock analyst
for 20 years, the last three at Mitchell Securities in New York.
``The actions are getting more desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much of a typical corporate executive's pay tied up in
his company's shares, the power of positive spin on stock prices
has never been more important to managers.
</P>
<P>
   An increasingly common tactic is to publicize one set of numbers
in a quarterly news release and conference calls and file a
different, usually less positive, set with regulators weeks later.
Another maneuver is to be vague in a news release claiming
blockbuster results, leaving investors unsure about what
contributed to the company's gains until the quarterly statements
are filed.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn E. Turner, chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange
Commission, is not happy about the trend. ``I'm concerned about
people trying to put a better spin on their numbers that may be in
fact misleading,'' he said. ``If you're going to play games with
investors, you've got to understand you're going to lose your
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Securities and Exchange Commission does not
regulate corporate news releases or conference calls, regulators do
say generally that companies must accurately portray the state of
their businesses to investors and the public. Companies that
distort their results could face regulatory action. Shareholder
lawsuits may also result.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bank of America conference call, Judah Kraushaar, a bank
analyst at Merrill Lynch, asked Hance whether any of the bank's
noninterest income designated as ``other'' included a material sale
of an asset or business that would not recur in coming quarters.
Hance replied, ``There is nothing in there but routine things.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bank's regulatory filing noted that fully 17 percent of
``other'' noninterest income, which totaled $515 million in the
quarter, was an $89 million nonrecurring gain on the ``sale of
certain businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Hance neglected to mention the $89 million,
Robert Stickler, Bank of America's spokesman, said, `` Hance was
focused on the line items that had significant extraordinary
aberrations in that quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   For a bank with $3.3 billion in income before taxes in the
quarter, $89 million may indeed seem like small change. But the
gain on the sale added 3 cents a share to the company's earnings in
the period. Without those 3 cents, analysts say, the bank would
have missed earnings estimates by a penny a share.
</P>
<P>
   Research organizations like First Call/Thomson Financial and
IBES compile analysts' earnings estimates daily to provide a
consensus of what Wall Street reckons a company will earn. With all
eyes on the magic earnings number, not meeting it can kill a stock.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened to National City Corp. of Cleveland, the
nation's 10th-largest bank, when it announced third-quarter
earnings of 57 cents a share on Oct. 15. Even though the results
were 9.6 percent ahead of the comparable period a year earlier,
Wall Street had been forecasting 58 cents a share. Investors fled
the stock, lopping 5.1 percent off its value.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always thus. ``Thirty years ago, nobody cared if
IBM's business for a quarter or two was slowing down because it
didn't have any impact on the company's stock price,'' said Howard
Schilit, president of the Center for Financial Research and
Analysis, an accounting watchdog firm in Rockville, Md. That's all
different with stock prices are trading at such high levels. ``Now,
because a company having a period of decline in their business will
have a very, very severe impact on the stock price, these companies
will do almost anything legally to prevent that from occurring,''
Schilit said.  &QL;

VERMONT SCHOOL SEVERS TIES TO INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In an about-face, the president of Norwich University, a private
military college in Vermont, announced Monday that he would ``sever
all formal ties with the Indonesian government.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision dismantles a two-year-old program for Indonesian
students that came under fire this fall, against the backdrop of a
brutal Jakarta-backed crackdown on civilians in East Timor. The
students were selected and their tuition was paid by the Indonesian
government through its military attache in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In October, when the Globe first reported the connection,
Norwich's president, Richard Schneider, maintained that excluding
the Indonesian students would amount to discrimination. But
Schneider last weekend changed his mind, decreeing that the school
would no longer accept payments from the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 undergraduates who are currently funded by the Indonesian
government will remain on campus, but their tuition will be paid
through ``alternative sources of funding,'' Schneider said. Norwich
will also establish scholarships for two students from East Timor,
``to demonstrate our commitment to helping the world's newest
nation as it sets about the onerous task of nation building.''
</P>
<P>
   Word spread quickly Monday among the small group of faculty who
have been trying to draw the administration's attention to human
rights abuses in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great. I feel stunned,'' said Mitch Hall, who is
director of the school's International Student Office and has been
one of the most vocal opponents of the cooperative program. ``I
think it's a tremendous leap forward and I think it's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the coming months, a university commission will lay new
ground rules for international students _ with a focus on when and
how a government's human rights record should affect a foreign
student's application. Some faculty members want the university to
invite outside human rights groups such as Amnesty International or
Human Rights Watch to consult on the school's admissions process.
</P>
<P>
   Until spring, when the panel delivers a report on international
admissions, the school will not accept any more students from the
Indonesian military. However, university spokesman Tom Greene said
there was ``unanimous support'' on campus for the continued
attendance of the undergraduates currently enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they applied again, we'd accept them again,'' he said.
``They've been great students.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Byrnes, one of the professors who argued for the changes,
said he and his colleagues never objected to Indonesian students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our criticism was never that there are Indonesian students
here,'' said Byrnes, who teaches in Norwich's history department.
``We objected to the fact that there seemed to be this
institutional relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Norwich-Indonesia program was set up in 1997 after an
exchange of visits between Norwich officials and two Indonesian
generals. The generals were members of Kopassus, the Indonesian
Army's elite special forces.
</P>
<P>
   After the East Timorese independence vote Aug. 30 triggered a
brutal military crackdown in the capital, Dili, President Bill
Clinton issued a ban on U.S. support for the Indonesian military.
Because the students were civilians, and because Norwich is a
private institution, the university was not bound by that ban, said
Greene.
</P>

   Last weekend, though, Schneider decided to discontinue the
program after months of dismay over the growing split between the
Indonesian military and the civilian government, said Greene.
Schneider had ``wanted to see how the Indonesian military would
react'' after the referendum, and became discouraged by what he
saw, Greene said.

<P>
   Some companies try to shift the focus away from the bad news in
their results by trumpeting what's good in the earnings release and
conference call, leaving the darker side to the less-well-read SEC
filing.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the third-quarter results contained in a news release
on Oct. 25 by Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino Resorts. The company exulted
that its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization had risen 18 percent from the third quarter of 1998.
Net income more than doubled, and earnings came in 9 cents a share
above the consensus estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The stock rose more than 8 percent on the day of the statement.
Clearly, it was a good quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Or was it? What Trump failed to note in its release was that it
had counted as revenue certain assets of an Official All-Star Cafe
in the Taj Mahal Casino. Because Planet Hollywood International
Inc., the troubled company that owned the cafe, had closed it and
ended its lease with Trump, the restaurant's fixtures, logos and
memorabilia were available for use by the Taj Mahal for four
months. The value of these assets was set by an ``independent''
consultant at $17.2 million, the company said. It was listed under
revenue as other income.
</P>
<P>
   Because Trump's news release lumped all the company's revenue
together, nothing was said about the $17.2 million in restaurant
assets. Investors assumed that the company's 1.4 percent increase
in revenue from a year earlier reflected an improvement in its
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Only in footnotes in the quarterly statement filed with the SEC
did the company specify that more than half of the $31 million in
other income for the quarter resulted inexplicably from the
restaurant's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas L. Ribis, president of Trump, did not return a phone
call seeking comment about the accounting maneuver. The stock has
since fallen back to its level before the upbeat earnings release.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just footnotes that can contain land mines. Some
companies actually change their bottom lines from the time of the
news release to the regulatory filing.
</P>
<P>
   IDT Corp., a telecommunications services provider in Hackensack,
N.J., put out a release on Oct. 14 gushing about its ``record''
fourth-quarter revenues and those for the full year ended July 31.
The stock rose 3.6 percent on the news.
</P>
<P>
   When IDT filed its SEC report on Nov. 4, several of the
company's expenses were greater than they had been in the earnings
news release. As a result, the company reported a much wider loss.
While the company's news release said it lost 15 cents a share in
the fourth quarter, the SEC filings indicated a loss of 18 cents a
share. The discrepancy between the documents was reported by The
Street.com.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the reports differ? Norman Rosenberg, an IDT spokesman,
said an error was found in figures supplied by a subsidiary,
Net2Phone, after the first release. ``It was not an intentional
mistake,'' Rosenberg said, adding, ``these are complex accounting
issues.'' When it was discovered, the discrepancy was corrected,
and the subsequent SEC filing contained the new numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, IDT did not issue a corrected news release. ``We
were going to,'' Rosenberg said. ``But Net2Phone did not, so our
position was we can't put out a press release about it if they
don't put out a press release about it.'' Since IDT controls the
voting shares in Net2Phone, it is unclear why the parent company
did not influence its subsidiary to publish such a release.
``Technically, we could have done it,'' Rosenberg said. ``Nobody
here felt like forcing them to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone can make a mistake, of course, but investors suspect
that some errors may not be inadvertent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are taking advantage of the fact that attention to
performance is increasingly concentrated in a small slice of time
surrounding the earnings release,'' said Martin S. Fridson, chief
high-yield debt strategist at Merrill Lynch. ``In principle, bad
news should have just as much impact if it's disclosed later on, in
the 10-Q,'' the quarterly SEC filings, he said. ``But companies are
betting that it won't and they may be right.''
</P>
<P>
   IDT's stock rose the day of its earnings release, but the shares
barely moved when it made its SEC filing.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the corporate dissembling is that investors should
be far more skeptical about news releases. Schilit, the accounting
watchdog, said that corporate earnings releases have become such a
good source of misinformation that his researchers use them to
identify companies that may be playing accounting games.
``Companies can dress up whatever they want to dress up in a
conference call, but SEC regulations require certain disclosure in
company filings,'' he said. ``Investors should absolutely wait
until the SEC filing comes out before making any decisions which
come from a preliminary announcement, press release or conference
call.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of patience is increasingly difficult for investors to
practice when they see others giddy over an earnings announcement.
But the reality check that SEC filings represent are becoming more
and more valuable, accounting experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of obscuring bad news while talking up the good is
at odds with the increasing candor in financial disclosures that
regulators have been calling for in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before the American Bankers Association in October,
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, urged
commercial bankers to improve their disclosures. ``The scale and
clarity of disclosures is better at some institutions than at
others and, on average, could be considerably improved,'' Greenspan
said.

 &HT;    Burnell plays Santa; Fulmer speaks on inspiration
 &HT;    By Alan Wooten
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. _ David Burnell took the joy stick as he sat down
and looked right at home playing the Nintendo game.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, he was at practice zipping upfield on a post
pattern and firmly catching a laser of a pass from David Garrard as
he stepped into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Both actions brought smiles. The difference was the first one
was, in so many ways, more important than the second for the 5-5,
145-pound East Carolina wide receiver during Mobile Alabama Bowl
week.
</P>
<P>
   Burnell's Nintendo abilities were tested as he played with some
youngsters at the University of South Alabama Children and Women's
Hospital. He was one of 11 East Carolina players who, along with 11
from Texas Christian, made a few rounds along with the toy-bearing
soldiers from the Navy Marine Corps Reserve Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines make the visit during the Senior Bowl, and with the
new bowl in town, get to do it twice this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I related to the kids real good,'' Burnell said.
``It's really that they look at me, and laugh really, and they're
amused at how short I am and play football. That comes as an
advantage that I can relate to the kids. But it's fun to see the
kids having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnell was joined by Jeff Kerr, Brantley Rivers, Nick Crabtree,
Andrew Bayes, Tomha McMillan, Eric Reyes, Carlos Ochoa, LaMont
Chappell, Kevin Monroe and Forrest Foster. TCU sent J.W. Wilson,
Royce Huffman, Chris Kaylakie, Patrick Batteaux, LaDainian
Tomlinson, Shannon Brazzell, Reggie Hunt, Cedric James, Curtis
Fuller, Mike Scarborough and Michael Keathley.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the children at the hospital suffer from sickle
cell, cystic fibrosis, asthma or respiratory synticial virus (RSV).
</P>
<P>
   As the players moved about from room to room, one young girl got
away with something offensive linemen can't _ she grabbed the arm
of Kerr and wouldn't let him go.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an experience,'' Kerr said. ``She grabbed a hold of
me, wouldn't let go, and it was a good thing because you don't
really get a chance to have that experience very often. I think it
was real rewarding for me, and I hope it gave her a sense of
reward, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa arrived Saturday with a steadfast goal in mind similar to
all the Pirates _ beat TCU Wednesday night. But he liked having a
big part in making a child's day Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it's all about,'' Ochoa said. ``Me personally,
this is the greatest reward you can give me, watching little kids
smile. This is when playing football becomes worth it to me, coming
here and seeing the kids _ this is the real world. This is what
really happens out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a part of that, to be a part of making a kid smile, you
can't give me anything better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspirational morning
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning's Fellowship of Christian Athletes breakfast,
featuring guest speaker Tennessee head coach Phillip Fulmer, was a
voluntary event for the Pirates. But several were in attendance and
inspired by his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer spoke with relation to his years in coaching and
encouraged his listeners through some testimony of his faith,
including the most special moment of last year's national
championship season which ended with the Volunteers' win over Bobby
Bowden and the Florida State Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my dad 10 years ago,'' Fulmer said. ``A few seconds
after I shook Coach Bowden's hand and turned to see the Tennessee
fans, I felt my dad's presence and knew that the Lord's presence
was there, too. I thanked God immediately that he allowed by dad to
come back and touch me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer assured that the Vols go through their routines with
faith as a key ingredient, and they are unashamed in letting people
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is not a rehearsal,'' Fulmer said. ``It's a one-shot
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Good workout
</P>
<P>
   Pirates head coach Steve Logan said his team enjoyed another
solid outing Monday afternoon. Skies were still overcast, but
finally began to clear and allow sun to shine by the time the team
made its way back to Ladd-Peebles Stadium to shower and change.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out today again and had a really good practice,''
Logan said. ``We'll come out tomorrow (Tuesday) in just helmets
only, run through a few assignments, break a light sweat and be
ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan said with open practices, no new wrinkles were being
shown. But he also said those new wrinkles were put in before the
team left Greenville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back home, we put in a lot of stuff,'' Logan said. ``You've
got to. I mean, I'm convinced defensive coordinators watch film,
too. We've added some stuff and deleted some stuff to hopefully
we've got a fresh enough approach to where we can get in the end
zone a time or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Curfew tonight
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive night, East Carolina remained without
a curfew for its players _ normal operating procedure, according to
the staff. The Pirates will have one tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players back home live off campus, and the night before a
game we got to a hotel and have a curfew,'' Logan said. ``But this
(Monday night) to me is like Thursday night, two days away from a
game. They can go out and do whatever they want to do. We'll get
them up in the morning and do our routine but tomorrow night we'll
have the curfew and the whole bit.''

EXCAVATING ANCIENT ARCHES IN JERUSALEM LEADS TO MODERN

 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the southeastern corner of the great stone plaza
surrounding the two ancient mosques, a lone bulldozer methodically
scraped away a millennium's worth of dust and rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian and Israeli policemen stood guard tensely nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them, freshly exposed to the Jerusalem sun, two
long-buried arches formed a new vaulted entryway to a vast
subterranean chamber. It is a chamber that Christians associate
with the 12th-century Crusaders who were once encamped there, and
that some Jews say could abut unexcavated ruins of the Second
Temple, built by the last Jewish kingdom more than 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To the Muslim worshipers who fill the underground hall every
Friday during the holy month of Ramadan, the pillared chamber is
the seventh-century Marwani mosque, and its history and
architectural integrity are nobody's business but their own. The
Muslim clerics who are the custodians of the site angrily reject
demands by rightist Israeli politicians that they halt the digging
until Israeli archaeologists ascertain that they are not causing
archaeological damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't wait for permission from anybody,'' said Sheik
Muhammad Hussein, the director of the Haram al-Sharif mosque
complex, surveying the plaza from the desk of his Ottoman-era
office. ``This is an Islamic site.''
</P>
<P>
   In a project originally urged and authorized by the Israeli
police, the old arched walls were unearthed to provide an emergency
exit for the underground mosque. Only one narrow stairway led down
to the chamber, which was refurbished three years ago to handle
overflow crowds arriving to pray at the above-ground mosques here,
al-Aksa and the Dome of the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   This last Friday a record 400,000 worshipers filled the mosques
and the plaza. As many as a half million are expected for the final
Friday of Ramadan _ which, by coincidence, falls on New Year's Eve,
when thousands of Christians are expected to congregate in the
storied hillsides and ravines immediately outside the immense
plaza.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where theology and archaeology are explosively
entwined, it was inevitable that the excavation would not be seen
as a simple doorway project.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had work begun than Jerusalem's mayor, Israel's
attorney general, and the chief of the state antiquities commission
said it could endanger artifacts in the interior of the platform
that supported the Second Temple before the Romans knocked it down.
</P>
<P>
   Far-right Jewish protesters marched through the Old City streets
below, burning Palestinian flags and vowing one day to demolish the
mosques above. Prime Minister Ehud Barak convened a cabinet-level
review of the project. The archways would remain open, he ordered _
but not without trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about a very sensitive, volatile place, and one
must refrain from doing anything hasty that we will regret
afterwards,'' the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli courts have so far refused to issue a requested
injunction against the project _ to the relief of the Barak
administration, which does not want to impose its authority on
Muslim worshipers who have never recognized Israeli sovereignty in
Jerusalem's Old City. But Israeli television has kept the issue
alive, broadcasting scenes of Palestinian trucks hauling loads of
soil rich with pottery shards to a city dump.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Hussein professed to be unconcerned by the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay it no mind,'' he said, dismissing the debate with a wave
of his hand. ``This is just a lot of noise stirred up by the
Israelis for their own internal reasons. It is a fight between
Israeli factions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some respected Israeli archaeologists also say the controversy
is overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where they are digging is all late medieval landfill,'' said
Dan Bahat, a former chief government archaeologist for Jerusalem.
``If it were up to me, I would not have used bulldozers. But there
is nothing of value there. There is certainly nothing from the
Second Temple period. That is nonsense.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Built by Herod the Great in one of the biggest construction jobs
of the Roman era, the mammoth structure Muslims know as Haram
al-Sharif and Israelis call the Temple Mount is ground zero for
Jerusalem's religious wars. It is crowned by the mosques that are
the third holiest site in Islam, after Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Wall of the great stone platform is the single most
sacred place of worship for observant Jews. A blocked-off portal in
its eastern wall is the fabled Golden Door, believed by some
fundamentalist Christians to be the divinely designated entryway
for the Second Coming of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   To tamper physically with any of this is to play a highly
dangerous game of three-dimensional chess. In 1996, violent riots
followed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's authorization of the
opening of a tunnel along the platform's deeply buried base.
Fifty-four Palestinians and fourteen Israelis died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the tunnel,'' said Jamal Joulani, a leader of the
Islamic Boy Scouts, whose young troops supervise crowds here during
Ramadan. ``The Israelis just want to prove they have sovereignty
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Ehud Olmert, a right-wing opposition leader, emphatically
agrees. By permitting Muslims to excavate with no oversight by
state archaeologists, the Barak administration is undermining
Israel's legal and moral claim to this crucial piece of Jerusalem
real estate, he charged. With Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
just beginning to try to reconcile their mutually exclusive
territorial demands here, this is a politically potent accusation.
</P>
<P>
   When Israeli forces occupied the Old City of Jerusalem in the
1967 Middle East War, Moshe Dayan, their commander, promised that
Muslim leaders would retain administrative autonomy at Islamic holy
sites. The Waqf, an Islamic religious foundation that holds title
to the mosques, has overseen public works there ever since, without
ever formally recognizing Israel's authority.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Jerusalem Waqf answers to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority, but on a practical level, it acknowledges Israel's de
facto control. The Waqf bulldozer was beginning to clear away a
third archway when Barak reiterated his decision to permit the
opening of two portals, but only two. The work abruptly stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment the Waqf acted beyond the authorization that we
gave them, we informed it immediately that it had to seal that
which had been opened _ and so it was,'' said Haim Ramon, the
Israeli government minister for Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   For Bahat, this archaeological spat is literally wide of the
mark. Where Second Temple remains might be found, he said, is about
200 yards to the west of the archways, directly beneath al-Aksa
mosque. But excavation there is considered unthinkable for both
diplomatic and religious reasons, he concedes.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen if the Temple were found?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when politics is harnessed to
archaeology,'' Bahat said.

HANK SNOW, COUNTRY MUSIC STAR, DIES AT 85
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hank Snow, one of the most popular and prolific country stars of
the 1950s, died Monday at his home in Madison, Tenn. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   In his nearly 50-year recording career, Snow released some 140
albums with more than 85 songs reaching the country charts. He was
a masterful songwriter with a clear, expressive baritone, and his
biggest hits extolled freedom, specifically the lure of traveling
and the release from tortuous love affairs, both often intertwined
in the same song. As a composer, he was a country and folk
traditionalist with a broad palette, able to incorporate everything
from mambo to jazz without straying far from his roots.
</P>
<P>
   Snow's career was a classic case of music's triumph over extreme
hardship. He was born Clarence Eugene Snow in a small town in Nova
Scotia called Brooklyn. His parents separated when he was 8,
sending two of his siblings to an orphanage and subjecting him to
the physical abuse of his grandmother, whose house he ran away from
to live with his mother. There, his stepfather also abused him,
eventually kicking the boy out of the house when he was 12. (Later,
Snow would record moving songs of abused children, like ``The
Drunkard's Boy.'') The 12-year-old found work on fishing boats,
where he entertained the rest of the crew by singing. After a
shipwreck four years later, he decided to stick to jobs on dry
land.
</P>
<P>
   Influenced by the yodeling country blues of Jimmie Rodgers, Snow
eventually saved up enough money for a guitar. When he was 19, he
was booked to sing on a weekly radio show on the Halifax station
CHNS and soon began performing in local clubs, earning the nickname
the Yodeling Ranger and, later, as his voice deepened and he
developed his own style, the Singing Ranger. It was at CHNS that
Snow changed his first name after a radio announcer suggested that
Hank sounded more country than Clarence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, Snow married Minnie Aaiders and signed his first record
deal, with the Canadian arm of RCA Victor. For the next 10 years,
he recorded some 90 songs, scoring hit after hit in Canada. But he
had yet to conquer America.
</P>
<P>
   He moved briefly to Hollywood in the mid-1940s, where he sang
his songs of rambling and performed with his trick pony, trying to
make it as a movie cowboy. In 1948, he got his first break in
America when he met the country singer Ernest Tubb. Tubb helped put
Snow on the Grand Ole Opry, where he was introduced by Hank
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But Snow's first Opry performance and recordings met with a
lukewarm response. As he was considering heading home to Canada,
his single ``I'm Moving On,'' a rolling fiddle-heavy song of failed
love and hitting the road sung in Snow's striking baritone, began
climbing the country charts until it reached No. 1 It stayed there
for 21 weeks, and Snow's career in America was off. His follow-up
songs, the similarly themed ``The Golden Rocket'' and the hybrid
``The Rhumba Boogie,'' also went to No. 1. Soon, Snow was living in
Nashville as an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Snow, a sharp businessman, met Col. Tom Parker, Elvis
Presley's future manager, and formed a booking company with him.
And, just as Tubb had done for him, Snow convinced the Grand Ole
Opry to book Elvis Presley in 1954. Presley later recorded music by
Snow, as did artists as diverse as Ray Charles, Les Paul and the
Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the '50s and '60s, Snow cut his own path through
country, mixing it with Hawaiian sounds, Latin music, rockabilly
and boogie without ever alienating his past work or influences like
Jimmie Rodgers and Sons of the Pioneers. In 1966, he spent 18 days
touring in Vietnam. But as Nashville slicked up its sound with
strings and heavy production, Snow's career began to falter. In the
'70s he formed the Hank Snow Foundation for the Prevention of Child
Abuse to provide abused children with the assistance he never
received. In 1979, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   After recording for RCA Records for some 45 years, the label
severed tied with him in 1981. Angry at his treatment by the record
label and the roots-revoking sound of new Nashville, he nonetheless
continued to perform and published an autobiography, ``The Hank
Snow Story,'' in 1994. After battling respiratory illness in 1995,
he returned to perform at the Grand Ole Opry the following year,
receiving a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Snow is survived by his son, Jimmie Rodgers Snow.

 &HT;    Two wins away from January play for Cowboys
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Two wins and they're in.
</P>
<P>
   That's the motto of the Dallas Cowboys, who are assured a berth
in the NFL playoffs if they close the regular season with victories
over New Orleans and the New York Giants. Of course, the Cowboys
have not won consecutive games since September.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the gloom of Sunday's 22-21 loss to the New York Jets is a
ray of optimism. The Cowboys are among 10 NFC teams with a chance
to play in the postseason, an indication of how close the race has
become.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys finish the season 9-7, they are in the playoffs.
Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   In case of a tie in the standings, Dallas owns tiebreaker edges
over Tampa Bay, Carolina, Green Bay and Washington. According to
the NFL, Minnesota needed to tie its last two games to knock Dallas
out. (Minnesota played host to Green Bay in Monday Night Football;
the outcome was not available at presstime.)
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Dallas beat the other playoff contenders in most
tie-breakers, such as head-to-head competition and winning
percentage in the division. The NFC playoffs include three division
champions and three wild-card teams. Dallas will win the NFC East,
by the way, if it sweeps its last two and Washington loses one of
its last two.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's looking ahead, something the Cowboys cannot
afford to do.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas coach Chan Gailey said his team will keeps its focus on
New Orleans, a 2-12 team coming off a 31-8 loss in Baltimore. After
opening the season with a victory, New Orleans has lost 12 of 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective now is to fight through this game, win it, and
then come back and beat the Giants at home (Jan. 2),'' Gailey said
Monday. ``That's the way to approach this.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule favors Dallas in the final two weeks, even though
the Cowboys have not proved they can win on the road consistently.
They should be heavy betting favorites against the Saints and
Giants. Nevertheless, Dallas has not won consecutive games since it
opened the season with three straight victories.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey spent much of his time Monday explaining his inconsistent
offense. The most disturbing part of Sunday's loss was quarterback
Troy Aikman's inability to connect with his receivers. In the
second half, Aikman completed only four of 13 passes for 37 yards.
He threw four straight incomplete passes on the Cowboys' final
drive to close the game.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman is only part of the problem, Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all held accountable,'' the coach said. ``Everybody is
on the offensive side. Everybody has their share.''
</P>
<P>
   And the pain of losing so many close games is starting to show.
The team's seven losses have been by an average of 5.4 points a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are again after seven losses, saying what we could do
and how good we can be,'' Emmitt Smith said in a frustrated tone.
``Who are we kidding?''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were victims of their own mistakes Sunday. The
league's most penalized team had eight penalties for 92 yards.
Aikman threw two interceptions, including a poorly thrown pass in
the end zone that was intended for Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get deep when (defensive backs) are running out
there,'' Sanders said. ``I can't catch them and the ball, too.
Don't blame me for that mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has played offense for two games, and the experiment has
not worked. He caught two of 14 passes against Philadelphia nine
days ago and was held without a reception against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he did not expect Sanders to produce much on
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting him to to have an impact because of his
presence on the field,'' Gailey said. ``But considering he only
practiced one week _ and then was sick most of last week _ you
can't expect all the timing to be there. Even great athletes have
to have a certain amount of timing.''

COURT SAYS SAME-SEX COUPLES DESERVE LEGAL PROTECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a groundbreaking ruling that could have national
implications, the Vermont Supreme Court Monday said gay and lesbian
couples are entitled to the same marriage benefits and protections
as heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   But the court stopped short of ruling that gay and lesbian
couples must be recognized under Vermont's existing marriage laws.
Instead, it ordered the state Legislature to decide whether it will
apply those laws to same-sex couples or create a new system of
``domestic partnerships'' providing gays and lesbians with an
equivalent legal status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever system is chosen must conform with the constitutional
imperative to provide all Vermonters with the common benefit,
protection, and security of the law,'' wrote Chief Justice Jeffrey
L. Amestoy.
</P>
<P>
   Amestoy also wrote that providing same-sex couples with ``legal
protection and security for their avowed commitment to an intimate
and lasting human relationship is simply, when all is said and
done, a recognition of our common humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont Governor Howard Dean and leaders of the Legislature
indicated Monday they would favor a parallel system of domestic
partnership instead of gay marriage. But the plaintiff's lawyers
said they would seek full marital status from the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is not over,'' said Beth Robinson, a lawyer for the
plaintiffs. ``It's over when people finally start marrying.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, gay and lesbian activists were thrilled by Monday's
ruling, calling it a landmark civil-rights victory and a legal
precedent that could eventually ripple throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed with the argument of the plaintiffs, two gay
male couples and one lesbian couple, that the state's refusal to
allow them to marry amounted to discrimination under Vermont's
constitution. Marriage provides more than 1,300 state and federal
benefits, they said, affecting taxes, inheritance _ even the right
to visit a dying partner in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have confronted the politically sensitive issue of
gay marriage, notably Hawaii, where the state's high court ruled
that banning gay marriage amounted to sex discrimination. However,
voters passed a constitutional amendment which rendered the
Hawaiian court's decision moot.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, no state recognizes same-sex marriage or other legal
unions with equivalent benefits and protections. The US Congress
and 30 states have passed so-called ``defense of marriage'' laws
explicitly preventing recognition of gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted with the decision of this court,'' said
Jennifer Levi, an attorney with Gay &AMP; Lesbian Advocates &AMP; Defenders
in Boston, which acted as co-counsel in the case. ``This really is
the first court to recognize the importance of extending the full
range of protections and benefits of marriage to same sex
couples.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision will have no direct effect outside Vermont, but
some legal scholars predicted that other state courts could follow
Vermont's logic.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont court's opinion will serve as a ``powerful and
persuasive precedent throughout the country,'' Harvard Law School
professor Laurence Tribe said Monday, and is ``likely to carry a
great deal of weight in other states,'' where similar court
challenges may soon follow.
</P>
<P>
   But some conservatives, while relieved the ruling does not
require legalized same-sex marriage, expressed serious reservations
about domestic partnerships as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sekulow, director of the American Center for Law and
Justice, a legal group that has challenged same-sex marriage
nationally, said he feared the ruling would lead to ``a fundamental
redefinition of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   ACLJ spokesman Gene Kapp added the group did not consider
domestic partnership benefits an acceptable compromise. ``The
unmarried couple should not receive the same benefits as a married
couple,'' Kapp said.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Dean, citing ``a clear discomfort in Vermont and
elsewhere around the country over gay marrage,'' said the state's
political leadership almost certainly would opt for domestic
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the legislature will probably pass a domestic
partnership act guaranteeing equal rights,'' the governor said,
adding: ``There is no possibility a gay marriage act is going to
pass.''
</P>
<P>
   State House Speaker Michael Obuchowski was less certain, but
said that ``domestic partnership is probably more attainable than
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling only asks that the legislature act within a
``reasonable period of time.'' But Obuchowski said he expects
hearings to begin on the issue early next month, and is hopeful the
issue can be resolved before the legislature's scheduled
adjournment date of April 15.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling has no immediate impact on Massachusetts, but some
gay marriage advocates expressed optimism that couples eventually
could drive to Vermont, get married, and return home seeking
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter it means nobody should rush to Vermont
over the holiday vacation to get married, because you can't _ and
you can't even get the same legal rights and protections today,''
said Peter Teachout, a constitutional scholar at Vermont Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians, activists and scholars agreed that the only way
other states would be obliged to honor gay unions in Vermont is if
the state legislature approves marriage rather than domestic
partnership. Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld, for instance,
once argued that the US Constitution's ``Full Faith and Credit''
clause would require the state to recognize a same-sex marriage
legally performed in another state. Governor Paul Cellucci, an
opponent of gay marriage, does not share that view.
</P>
<P>
   And Cellucci said Monday he does not believe the Vermont ruling
will set a precedent for other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt very much that that would be what the Supreme Court of
the United States would say about the US Constitution, and I doubt
that's what the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts would say
abt the Massachusetts Constitution,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's view differed from that of Harvard's Tribe,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the right ruling under the constitutional law of
many states'' which, like Vermont, have expansive equal-protection
clauses, Tribe said. ``It would be very hard for a Massachusetts
court not to find this a fairly powerful line of analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   But US Representative Barney Frank said gay-rights advocates
should let the nation watch the effects of Vermont's new law before
pushing for change around the country faster than the public is
ready to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to give us a chance to show the fallacy of the
argument that allowing the same-sex couple to be legally as well as
emotionally committed to each other somhow jeopardizes heterosexual
marriage,'' Frank said. ``Let's let Vermont work this out and let
the rest of the country benefit from the experience we see in
Vermont.''

VERMONT SCHOOL SEVERS TIES TO INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In an about-face, the president of Norwich University, a private
military college in Vermont, announced Monday that he would ``sever
all formal ties with the Indonesian government.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision dismantles a two-year-old program for Indonesian
students that came under fire this fall, against the backdrop of a
brutal Jakarta-backed crackdown on civilians in East Timor. The
students were selected and their tuition was paid by the Indonesian
government through its military attache in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In October, when the Globe first reported the connection,
Norwich's president, Richard Schneider, maintained that excluding
the Indonesian students would amount to discrimination. But
Schneider last weekend changed his mind, decreeing that the school
would no longer accept payments from the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 undergraduates who are currently funded by the Indonesian
government will remain on campus, but their tuition will be paid
through ``alternative sources of funding,'' Schneider said. Norwich
will also establish scholarships for two students from East Timor,
``to demonstrate our commitment to helping the world's newest
nation as it sets about the onerous task of nation building.''
</P>
<P>
   Word spread quickly Monday among the small group of faculty who
have been trying to draw the administration's attention to human
rights abuses in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great. I feel stunned,'' said Mitch Hall, who is
director of the school's International Student Office and has been
one of the most vocal opponents of the cooperative program. ``I
think it's a tremendous leap forward and I think it's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the coming months, a university commission will lay new
ground rules for international students _ with a focus on when and
how a government's human rights record should affect a foreign
student's application. Some faculty members want the university to
invite outside human rights groups such as Amnesty International or
Human Rights Watch to consult on the school's admissions process.
</P>
<P>
   Until spring, when the panel delivers a report on international
admissions, the school will not accept any more students from the
Indonesian military. However, university spokesman Tom Greene said
there was ``unanimous support'' on campus for the continued
attendance of the undergraduates currently enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they applied again, we'd accept them again,'' he said.
``They've been great students.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Byrnes, one of the professors who argued for the changes,
said he and his colleagues never objected to Indonesian students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our criticism was never that there are Indonesian students
here,'' said Byrnes, who teaches in Norwich's history department.
``We objected to the fact that there seemed to be this
institutional relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Norwich-Indonesia program was set up in 1997 after an
exchange of visits between Norwich officials and two Indonesian
generals. The generals were members of Kopassus, the Indonesian
Army's elite special forces.
</P>
<P>
   After the East Timorese independence vote Aug. 30 triggered a
brutal military crackdown in the capital, Dili, President Bill
Clinton issued a ban on U.S. support for the Indonesian military.
Because the students were civilians, and because Norwich is a
private institution, the university was not bound by that ban, said
Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, though, Schneider decided to discontinue the
program after months of dismay over the growing split between the
Indonesian military and the civilian government, said Greene.
Schneider had ``wanted to see how the Indonesian military would
react'' after the referendum, and became discouraged by what he
saw, Greene said.

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ In the absence of a strong international
police force in Kosovo and facing a rise in crime, the commander of
peacekeeping troops in the province has ordered his soldiers back
out onto the streets in force.
</P>
<P>
   He is not happy about it, but six months into the peacekeeping
mission in Kosovo, he says the 1,800-member U.N. police force was
not able to cope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized there was no success and that we had to back up
the police,'' the commander, Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, said Monday in
an interview at his headquarters, perched on a hill above Pristina,
the Kosovo capital.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend a marked increase of troops was evident here,
as they set up road blocks to spot-check cars for weapons and to
look at the identification papers of drivers and passengers. The
troops were reacting to the increase in violence of recent weeks
and a fear of kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt joined in the call for nations to contribute more
people to the police force, but in the meantime he is stepping in
to fill the gap, sending some of his forces out from their bases by
the hundreds. ``You cannot fight the high-level criminal with a
tankist or a soldier _ they are not trained to do it,'' he said.
``But there is a gap which we try to bridge by being there.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt took over command of the 50,000 members of the
peacekeeping force for Kosovo in October, after his predecessor,
Gen. Mike Jackson, said the job was no longer one for the military,
but for the U.N. police and civil administration.
</P>
<P>
   Now two months later, Reinhardt and the overwhelming presence of
his soldiers represent the only realistic chance to prevent
violence in the province. Alongside ethnic killings and
intimidation _ mostly by Albanians against Serbs and other
minorities _ there has also been an increase of crime among the
Albanians and a spread of organized crime, all of which falls to
the general's lot.
</P>
<P>
   The general, who began his military career in the German
Mountain Infantry and went through the U.S. Army's Command and
General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. in the 1970s, is a
gray-haired, unassuming man. In his loose-fitted German camouflage
jacket, he lacks the charisma of the tall, battered figure of
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in his quiet way, he is tackling the nasty climate of ethnic
retaliation with a firm resolution and some unorthodox ideas that
he says are bearing results.
</P>
<P>
   Each of his five military brigades in Kosovo has 120 patrols out
on the streets, in the villages and countryside every day, he said,
and 1,000 of his forces are day and night guarding Serbian families
in their homes and protecting buildings and installations.
</P>
<P>
   He is moving troops from areas that are relatively calm,
dominated by one ethnic group, to mixed areas, or ``fault lines,''
where there is violence. He has boosted the troop level in the
Serbian area of Kosovo Polje, just outside Pristina, to 2,000 from
600, and improved security considerably.
</P>
<P>
   He has also sent an extra battalion to the town of Gniljane, in
the American sector, and moved in three companies to protect the
various ethnic minorities _ Serbs, Muslim Slavs or Goranis and
Turks _ in and around the town of Prizren in southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   German forces in the Prizren area have been criticized for not
doing enough to stop the intimidation of minorities there, but the
general sticks by his policy. ``With 50,000 men, you cannot
safeguard everyone, but by being there we can prevent things
happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has been resolute, too, in ordering sweeps through districts
where there has been an outbreak of violence, often traveling to
watch the operations himself. He was there when French troops
sealed off and searched an area in the Serbian part of the divided
town of Mitrovica last week after a grenade attack. ``We put on a
big show of force,'' he said, ``to show we take counter actions
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Road blocks or barricades are not tolerated, and even the
residents of Orohovac have been persuaded to remove their weeks-old
blockade against Russian troops who were to deploy there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took them away by persuading people that this is the better
way,'' he said. He does not seem to have solved the issue of the
Russian deployment there, which local Albanians vigorously oppose,
but the tension has subsided.
</P>
<P>
   The general also supports an unorthodox tactic used in Pristina,
where the British commander of the city is using former policemen
of the Kosovo Liberation Army as a source of information and a
conduit for solving problems.
</P>
<P>
   There are clearly parts of the mission that chafe the general.
``It is tougher than I expected as far as the workload, and more
difficult as far as human relationships,'' he said in a reference
to the ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   He is impatient to see the judicial system up and running so he
can rid his soldiers of the job of being prison guards.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has clear ideas about the running of the province that go
beyond his role as a soldier. Just back from a lunch with four
Serbian bishops in the monastery at Gracanica, outside Pristina, he
was clearly determined to defend the Serbian minority. His men will
protect Serbian convoys and buses to allow Serbs to travel to
market and to other Serbian enclaves. ``By doing that we take the
pressure out of the pot,'' he said. ``If people feel under siege
they become aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for financing for education and employment, saying a
majority of young Albanians were jobless and frustrated, and were
taking out their frustration on the minorities.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he disagreed with the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, which is advising displaced Serbs not to try to return to
Kosovo for the moment, and he spoke with satisfaction that a few
hundred Serbs had managed to return to villages in northern Kosovo
under protection of his troops.

VERMONT COURT RULES GAYS MUST BE PROVIDED SAME RIGHTS AS
HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Vermont Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the
state must guarantee the very same protections and benefits to
committed gay and lesbian couples as it does to heterosexual
spouses. The court ordered the Legislature to either make Vermont
the first state to legalize gay marriage or to adopt a domestic
partnership law that would be the most sweeping in the country.
</P>
<P>
   To extend equal rights to homosexual couples ``who seek nothing
more, nor less, than legal protection and security for their avowed
commitment to an intimate and lasting relationship is simply, when
all is said and done, a recognition of our common humanity,'' the
ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   The court found that it was unconstitutionally discriminatory to
deny marriage licenses to three homosexual couples, thus depriving
them of the myriad benefits, from inheritance rights to health
insurance to tax breaks, that accrue to heterosexual married
couples.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling gave legislators an unspecified ``reasonable period
of time'' to consider whether the remedy lay in some sort of
``domestic partnership'' system or in simply including homosexual
partners in the state's marriage laws.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Shumlin, the president pro tempore of the Vermont Senate,
said on Monday that the state's predominantly Democratic lawmakers
may decide in the coming session, which begins next month, how to
respond. He expects it will be much easier to get votes for a
domestic partnership law than one creating full-fledged gay
marriages, but ``both are strong possibilities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the court says, `You have a class of people whose civil
rights are being trampled upon, Vermonters want to remedy that,'''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Piecemeal systems of protections and benefits for gay and
lesbian couples have been enacted in recent years in places around
the country, but advocates for gay rights said on Monday that the
Vermont ruling would put the state far ahead of anywhere else.
California and Hawaii have statewide domestic partnership systems,
they said, but they pale next to what is likely to come about in
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   If Vermont opts for full-fledged gay marriage and homosexual
couples begin flocking to the state to wed, their legal status in
their home states will prove a very tangled issue, experts said on
Monday. Since the prospect of legalized gay marriage arose in a
Hawaii case in 1991, nearly 30 states have passed laws against it.
But gay rights advocates say it is not clear whether those laws
would stand up against challenges. Most likely, legal experts say,
there would be state-by-state battles over recognizing same-sex
marriages performed in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision, written by Chief Justice Jeffrey L. Amestoy,
exhilarated the three couples suing the state, their lawyers and
the many gay and civil rights groups supporting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrated our 27th anniversary together in October,'' said
one of the plaintiff couples, Holly Puterbaugh and Lois Farnham, in
a joint statement. ``We look forward to the time when we can
finally make it official.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Levi, a lawyer for Gay and Lesbian Advocates and
Defenders who worked on the case, said, ``It's unbelievable. The
scope and the magnitude of it are really tremendous.'' Never
before, she said, has a state supreme court guaranteed ``the full
range of benefits, in both public and private employment'' to
same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling brought expressions of dismay from the religious,
conservative and other groups who oppose gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is not only troubling but it is tremendously
disappointing,'' said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the American
Center for Law and Justice, a national conservative group, in a
statement. ``This is the first court in the country that has
mandated same-sex marriage. And while this legal decision is
designed to elevate the status of same-sex couples, it really
represents a slap in the face for marriage between a man and a
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the Republican presidential candidate, declared:
``If I were living in Vermont, and had three women I was living
with, I would immediately file suite for benefits for my female
live-ins. Once a court says the benefit of marriage is not limited
to a man and a woman, then everything is up for grabs. Why not four
men living together, why not every possible combination you can
imagine?''
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, Craig Bensen, an evangelical pastor and vice
president of a coalition that opposes gay marriage, said the group,
Take it to the People, was considering a strategy like that used in
Hawaii and Alaska, where opponents of gay marriage put the idea to
a referendum and got enough votes to block it. Earlier this month,
tTe Hawaii Supreme Court dismissed a gay marriage case there as
moot because a ballot measure in 1998 had authorized lawmakers to
restrict the definition of marriage to heterosexual unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect there will be momentum for a constitutional
amendment to clarify the nature of marriage,'' he said. ``The
difficulty is, we've got the toughest constitution to amend in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the ruling went against them, Mr. Bensen and others on
his side said they were happy to see the question now go to the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   William Sorrell, the state's attorney general, noted that
because the court's decision was based on the state's constitution
rather than the federal one, the ruling cannot be appealed to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Other courts have ruled in favor of certain
spousal benefits for gay couples in a limited way. But, he said,
``Where this case goes further than any court has gone thus far is
that the whole panoply, if you will, of benefits and protections
that flow from traditional marriages are guaranteed under the
Vermont Constitution to same-sex couples.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Although the court's ruling focused on benefits rather than
marriage itself, lawyers for the same-sex couples said on Monday
that they believed that the Legislature would ultimately choose
full-fledged marriage for same-sex couples. A domestic partnership
system would not go far enough to secure gay couples the same exact
privileges as heterosexual ones, such as access to benefits from
the federal government and private employers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legal status of marriage carries with it a lot of
baggage,'' said Beth Robinson, a lead lawyer for the couples. ``The
Legislature will come to understand that as a practical matter, you
can't call it something different and have it be truly equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Monday's ruling was not a total victory for gay rights
advocates, it still left some marveling at what they described as
tremendously rapid social progress.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Coles, director of the Lesbian and Gay Rights Project of
the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the phrase
``domestic partnership'' was only invented about 19 years ago, back
when there was virtually no recognition of gay and lesbian
relationships and the whole idea was so far out that when the San
Francisco City Council passed a domestic partnership law, the mayor
then, Dianne Feinstein, vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about the way law and society move,'' he said,
``to go from San Francisco considering domestic partnerships too
far out there in 1981, to all five justices of the Vermont Supreme
Court taking equal treatment for granted in 1999 _ it's
astonishing, it really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the justices, who are appointed by the governor and can
be removed by the Legislature, all concurred that gay couples
should be protected from discrimination, they were not in such
simple agreement about other parts of the ruling. Three of the
court's five justices disagreed with some of Amestoy's reasoning,
and one, Denise R. Johnson, wrote that the court should order the
state to let the couples marry, rather than consigning them to ``an
uncertain fate in the political cauldron'' of a debate in the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The case began in 1997 when the three couples _ Holly Puterbaugh
and Lois Farnham, Stan Baker and Peter Harrigan, and Nina Beck and
Stacy Jolles _ filed suit after their local town clerks denied them
marriage licenses. A Superior Court judge turned them down, but
they appealed to the state Supreme Court, which heard their oral
arguments last November.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, Ms. Puterbaugh told reporters on Monday, will make
this a special Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's going to be a little extra feeling of family
now,'' she said.

BOND-MARKET ANXIETY HELPS DRAGS DOWN THE DOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A bad day in the bond market hurt some segments of
the stock market Monday as concerns mounted about what Federal
Reserve policy-makers might do about interest rates at a meeting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks seen as sensitive to rising interest rates, like
financial-services companies, suffered after bond traders lifted
the yield on the 30-year Treasury to 6.44 percent, its highest in
27 months, from 6.37 percent on Friday. The bond's price, which
moves in the opposite direction, fell 25/32, to 95 29/32.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in stocks like J.P. Morgan and Citigroup helped to
pull down the Dow Jones industrial average by 113.16 points, or 1
percent, to 11,144.27.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the economy continuing to be quite strong, the assumption
is that the Fed will definitely move, and possibly on Tuesday'' to
raise short-term interest rates, said David Mead, chief investment
officer at Harris Bank in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt they will move that rapidly,'' he added, ``but the
fear is they may tighten by half a percentage point at their
meeting in February.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, demand for technology stocks remained intense, and
the Nasdaq composite index set a third consecutive record and its
55th of the year. It rose 30.81 points, or 0.8 percent, to
3,783.87.
</P>
<P>
   The continued rise in technology and Internet stocks ``is very
frustrating for anyone who has any sort of value orientation,''
said Thomas O'Neill, chief investment officer at Fleet Boston
Investment Advisors. ``This is a market that is driving anyone who
wants to do old-fashioned analysis to question their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   The other main market gauges were narrowly mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index closed at 1,418.09, down
2.94 points, or 0.2 percent. But the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies gained 0.98 point, or 0.2 percent, to 467.19.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among analysts is that the central bank will leave
short-term rates unchanged Tuesday and continue with its neutral
stance toward any future rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, that view is based on the fact that the Fed,
which has been injecting liquidity into the banking system as a
precautionary measure before the turn of the century, does not want
to roil financial markets because of the uncertainty about how
potential Year 2000 computer problems will affect the economy.
</P>
<P>
   At this juncture, a move to raise rates would come as a
definite, negative surprise, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they tightened again and said they are not afraid of Y2K,
then that could set the stage for a big year-end sell-off,'' said
Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Although financial-services stocks were losers, Honeywell
International was the biggest single contributor to the decline in
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The stock fell 7 1/4, to 56 1/2, after Honeywell said it had
agreed to buy Pittway, the maker of burglar alarms, for $2.2
billion, a 57 percent premium to its closing price on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among financial-services company stocks, J.P. Morgan was down 1
21/64, to 126 51/64. Citigroup closed at 54 27/64, down 5/64. And
Chase Manhattan dropped 1/2, to 72 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, share prices of both Monsanto and Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn
both fell after the rival drug makers agreed to merge. Monsanto
closed at 36 5/8, down 5 1/8, while Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn fell 3 1/8,
to 47 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies did better after announcing stock splits.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle gained 5 5/8, to 96 5/16, after the world's largest maker
of database software said it would split its shares 2 for 1.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat, a developer of a computer operating system that
competes with Microsoft's Windows, gained 15 1/16, to 267 15/16,
after it said it would split its stock 2 for 1.
</P>
<P>
   And Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's stock also gained after the
financial- services company announced fourth-quarter earnings that
were well above Wall Street estimates, as well as a 2-for-1 stock
split. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter stock closed at 130 21/64, up 2
17/64.

A TRIUMPH FOR RYDER, UNINTERRUPTED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winona Ryder has devoted half a decade to bringing Susanna
Kaysen's mental hospital memoir ``Girl, Interrupted'' to the
screen. Happily, and unlike some movie stars' pet projects, that
long period of care and consideration is evident throughout the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly funny, sensitive and dubious of psychological
simplification, the film is hardly the ``Bedlam'' rehash it could
easily have become; in fact, it in many ways it makes the
relatively enlightened ``Snake Pit'' look lurid. But one of
``Interrupted's'' strongest accomplishments is the way it brings
full, dignified dimension to many of its young women while not
downplaying the genuine problems most of them, with varying degrees
of success, must cope with.
</P>
<P>
   Director James Mangold (``Cop Land''), who was also responsible
for the screenplay adaptation's final form, only occasionally
lapses into sensationalism (and by the time he does, the story more
or less needs to go there), and overindulges in one obvious
metaphor (too many ``Wizard of Oz'' references). Much more
significantly, he subtly yet strongly captures the peculiar tenor
of the late 1960s, in which the film is set, and how the vastly
different views of the era's young people could quite credibly be
viewed as crazy by their elders.
</P>
<P>
   And while that might be all that's going on with Ryder's
Susanna, the film is much too smart to paint her as simply
misunderstood. The 17-year- old daughter of a well-off Boston
family did, after all, chase a bottle of aspirin with one of vodka.
It may not have been the most extravagant suicide attempt in
history, but it was nevertheless a cry of anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Susanna doesn't know why she feels so unhappy, and even after
two years at the cushiest institution money can buy (condensed to
one year in the movie), she and we remain uncertain about it all.
There are early intimations that an affair with a teacher drove her
over the edge, but that probability eventually fades. One of her
smugger shrinks, played as sympathetically as possible by Vanessa
Redgrave, suggests a more pathological promiscuity. This may or may
not be part of Susanna's nature but clearly, considering the sexual
revolution raging all around, it's not the wellspring of her
discomfort either.
</P>
<P>
   A wise and patient nurse, played by Whoopi Goldberg with an
admirable minimum of cloyingness, comes closest to pinpointing
Susanna's real, comparatively minor complaint. But her insights,
astute as they may be, can't settle the whole question, either.
</P>
<P>
   The film's main focus is on the girls in fictional Claymoore
Hospital's minimum security wing. To tell the truth, there's
actually little security there at all. Each inmate has a nice,
semi-private room, many have grounds-walking privileges and
something like conjugal visits are even permitted. The ward's
resident, dominant sociopath, Lisa (Angelina Jolie in an enjoyably
showoff, effortlessly provocative performance), also has keys to
most of the facility's off-limits areas (like, absurdly, a basement
bowling alley).
</P>
<P>
   Susanna's backstory is told in a complex but revealing flashback
structure that superbly illustrates her initial confusion. But the
film gradually eases into two main narrative lines: Susanna's
coming to terms with herself and the charismatic Lisa's toxic
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder expertly modulates her performance to Susanna's mood
swings. But more than that, she displays an outstanding, seemingly
instinctive sense of when to express Susanna through words and when
to speak more through silence. Ryder has long had something of
Lillian Gish in her screen presence, and ''Interrupted'' displays
that sublime gift for visual acting better than any of her previous
films. At the same time, the girlish tics that have irritated in
some of Ryder's earlier roles have been banished from her bracingly
mature and prickly ''Girl'' woman.
</P>
<P>
   Other standouts in the cast include Brittany Murphy as an
isolationist whose problems go far deeper than her apparent bulimia
and Clea Duvall as a sweet and vulnerable compulsive liar. Unlike
some girls in the facility _ who by today's sensibilities wouldn't
even be considered eccentric, let alone candidates for treatment _
these two aren't just victims of the time's retrograde attitudes
but people in definite need of help. The mysteries of the mind
remain elusive throughout ``Girl, Interrupted.'' Those who want
simple answers where none pertain may find that maddening but, at
least compared to most movies about mental illness, it's really a
remarkably sane approach. &QL;

 &HT;    Abernathy case in jury's hands
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Former Georgia state Sen. Ralph David Abernathy III's
attorney told a jury in final arguments Monday that the state's own
witnesses testified Abernathy had paid them for their work _ but
the prosecution pointed out that those witnesses said they hadn't
been fully paid.
</P>
<P>
   The jury began deliberating just before 2 p.m. on the 28 counts
against Abernathy, based on eight expense vouchers he turned in to
the state. The jury continued deliberations into the night Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is Abernathy's second trial on the charges, which involve
theft, false swearing, violation of his oath, forgery and
influencing a witness. His first trial, in September, ended in a
hung jury. Some jurors said it was caused by a single woman who
refused to consider convicting Abernathy.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Stacey Hydrich, in the first of her
two final arguments, told the jury that Abernathy ``used his office
to defraud the people of the state and to line his own pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the state, Abernathy filled out vouchers while he
was a state senator, had various aides and helpers swear he had
paid them, collected the money and kept all or most of it.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Lackland, Abernathy's lead attorney, said he offered no
witnesses for the defense ``because their witnesses were our
witnesses. They came in here and told the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the witnesses for whom Abernathy turned in state expense
vouchers all testified they were paid. Some said they were paid in
part, but never saw all the money that Abernathy had them swear
they had been paid.
</P>
<P>
   Because the defense unaccountably submitted a single piece of
evidence _ a copy of the Georgia code concerning notaries public _
the state had the privilege of making the opening and closing final
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   In her closing argument, Hydrich proposed to play excerpts from
the state's strongest evidence, tape recordings of telephone
conversations in which Abernathy asks his former public relations
adviser, Zee Bradford, to tell the GBI he had paid her the $2,700
for which he had signed her name to vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The defense objected to playing excerpts, so Judge L.A.
McConnell allowed her to play the tapes in their entirety.

ON THE TRAIL OF TERRORISM, IN WAKE OF ARREST IN WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Vt., British Columbia)   (Eds.: This story was budgeted earlier as TERROR-ARREST, with a
different byline and dateline; this story includes new material.) 
(jw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal authorities have concluded that an Algerian
man arrested with bomb components as he tried to enter Washington
state last week from Canada represented a serious terrorist threat,
but are far from certain about the purpose or target of any
possible attack.
</P>
<P>
   As counterterrorism agents sifted through the background of the
suspect, Ahmed Ressam, examining links to known Middle Eastern
terror groups, President Clinton's national security adviser said
Monday that there was no specific evidence, beyond the case of
Ressam, that foreign nationals were plotting other terrorist acts
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, said that Americans
should be watchful as they prepared for New Year's activities, but
said that counterterrorism officials knew of no additional domestic
threats. The State Department had previously cautioned Americans
traveling overseas to be vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, customs inspectors in Vermont detained a man and
woman on Sunday evening trying to enter the United States from
Canada, one of them carrying false documents, officials said. But
law enforcement officials said Monday that they were uncertain of
the significance of the inquiry in Vermont or whether it was in any
way related to the arrest of Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are examining whether Ressam is associated with
any known terrorist group, like the Islamic Armed Group. Officials
said they did not yet know whether he belonged to the group or had
received training in improvised explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, law enforcement officials said they had determined that
Ressam could have used the materials to construct a lethal
explosive device and, on that basis, decided he was a serious
potential threat.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, who was caught by a Customs Service inspector on Dec. 14
as he arrived on a car ferry at Port Angeles, Wash., was carrying
in his vehicle materials that could be assembled into a crude but
powerful bomb. The materials included more than 20 ounces of a
nitroglycerin derivative and digital timing devices that could be
used in a detonator.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam appeared nervous when questioned by an inspector and
tried to flee after the ferry arrived. He carried two driver's
licenses, one under an apparently assumed name, officials said. He
had a hotel reservation in Seattle for one night and a rental car
contract with a return date of Dec. 16, indications, the officials
said, that he was planning a short stay in Seattle and might be
acting only as an intermediary or courier in a larger plot.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the potentially suspicious evidence, little is known
about his intentions because Ressam, who is being held in jail, has
declined to cooperate with the authorities. As a result, American
officials are relying on Canadian law enforcement agencies to help
provide insight into Ressam, who lived in Canada until last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was believed to have been accompanied on the ferry from
Vancouver, British Columbia, for part of the trip to the United
States by Karim Said Atmani, whom Canadian officials say may have
shared an apartment with Ressam in Montreal. Atmani is believed to
have returned to Canada and left Ressam to complete the journey
alone, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Canadian authorities previously said they had extradited
Atmani to France after he allegedly participated in several
bombings, including one in a Paris subway in 1996, a French law
enforcement official said Monday that Atmani had not been
extradited to France and that there was no information linking him
to the bombing. The French official said Canada had previously
expelled Atmani to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The French official said Ressam and Atmani were both known to
French intelligence and were connected to radical groups he
described as gangster-terrorist organizations. But he said the
French government had no information linking either man directly to
the terrorist operations of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born
militant who is blamed for the bombing of two U.S. embassies in
Africa in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, a spokesman said it was premature to
determine clearly whether Ressam was a member of a known extremist
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they're looking into his motivation, his
intentions, whether he had accomplices and whether he was part of a
wider network and is affiliated with international terrorist
groups,'' said the spokesman, James Foley.

$6 BILLION MERGER WOULD CREATE LARGEST NORTH AMERICAN RAILROAD

 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. and Canadian National Railway
Co. announced a $6 billion merger Monday that would create the
largest railroad in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would have 50,000 miles of track stretching
from Nova Scotia to Los Angeles and the Gulf of Mexico, connecting
every state west of the Mississippi and every major city across the
length of Canada. Burlington Northern, a longtime advocate of a
transcontinental railroad, would vault ahead of Union Pacific as
the biggest railroad and solidify its position as the largest
carrier of coal and grain.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed combination will face regulatory scrutiny in the
United States and in Canada, but it is only the latest step in
fulfilling every rail tycoon's dream for the last 150 years of
establishing a transcontinental railroad in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Krebs, the chairman of Burlington Northern, and other
proponents have contended that such a railroad would provide
shippers with seamless, coast-to-coast service that is cheaper and
more predictable, despite the disruptions that have accompanied
virtually every recent merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed merger positions this company as the front-runner
in any potential transcontinental mergers in the United States,''
said Carole M. Neely, a transportation analyst with Brown Brothers
Harriman. ``I'm confident this will be good for both railroads as
well as the industry. The new franchise will be the largest in
terms of market capitalization and geographic presence within North
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors did not immediately embrace the deal, as shares
of Burlington Northern fell $3.5625 or 13 percent Monday to
$24.8125 on the New York Stock Exchange. Canadian National shares
fell 2.8 percent to $42.95 (Canadian) or $29.20 on the Toronto
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a reaction to past merger problems with investors
saying, I don't want to be around for this one,'' said Michael H.
Lloyd, a transportation analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``But I think
it'll calm down tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the proposed deal, Burlington Northern would
own about two-thirds of a new company, North American Railways Inc.
The deal consists of a stock swap in which Canadian National
shareholders will get 1.05 shares of North American Railways, while
Burlington Northern shareholders will get a share of the new
company for each of their shares.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would employ 67,000 people and have annual
revenue of about $12.5 billion. It would be based in Montreal,
although the headquarters for Burlington Northern would remain in
Fort Worth, Texas. Paul Tellier, chief executive of Canadian
National, would serve as chief executive of North American
Railways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination uses a new model for railroad consolidation,''
said Krebs, who would become the non-executive chairman of the new
company, ``one that will enable the partners to effectively
integrate with maximum efficiency and without sacrificing quality
customer service. The model carefully preserves and protects the
existing identities and efficient rail networks of each company.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the New York market still eludes him, Krebs will get
the transcontinental link he has long sought and connections to a
major, deep water port on the East Coast, Halifax. Both companies
expect that most of the growth in rail traffic will be north-south,
rather than east-west.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the latest announcement could spur another
round of consolidation that has already put more than 90 percent of
North American rail revenue into the coffers of a half dozen
companies. Canadian Pacific, Canada's other major railroad, would
almost certainly become a target, especially since it has a route
into the lucrative New York market, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Clark, vice president of Canadian Pacific in Calgary,
said his company would not rush into anything. He described the
latest deal as a ``financial merger'' and acknowledged that
alliances with American railroads are ``necessary to improve the
financial performance'' of major carriers. He said he preferred the
cooperative arrangements Canadian Pacific had with Union Pacific,
Norfolk Southern and CSX to a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a large railway like Burlington Northern shows up on your
doorstep,'' Clark said, ``they want to move traffic away as much as
grow traffic in your neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger will almost certainly face opposition from rival
railroads, Canadian nationalists and rail freight customers, who
have been battered by delays and tie-ups caused by recent mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be rough sailing,'' Robert L. Banks, a longtime
transportation consultant in Washington, predicted. ``There'll be
opponents coming from many different quarters, here and in
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Shippers are still grumbling about widespread delays and freight
snarls in the West during 1997 and 1998 as Union Pacific struggled
to absorb Southern Pacific Rail Corp., in a $5.4 billion deal. In
the East, Norfolk Southern Corp. and CSX Corp. have split up
Conrail in a $10.2 billion transaction, and faced similar, albeit
less dramatic, problems in integrating those assets into their rail
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the logistical nightmares, shippers have complained
that they are increasingly at the mercy of a single railroad
serving a particular city or area of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Emmett, president of the National Industrial
Transportation League, said that the rail, truck and ocean-shipping
customers who make up his trade association are almost universally
opposed to the alliance between Burlington Northern and Canadian
National.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rail shippers are still waiting for the railroads to
deliver on the better service promised by the earlier mergers,''
Emmett said. ``They haven't got that right yet. And the thought of
yet another megamerger is a kick in the gut to shippers.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda J. Morgan, chairman of the Surface Transportation Board,
the regulatory agency that would have to approve the deal, said
Monday that the announcement took her by surprise. ``Railroads,
together with their customers and employees, have not yet fully
adjusted to recent mergers, and this proposal may represent the
beginning of another round of major rail mergers,'' Ms. Morgan said
in a statement. ``The Board will have to review carefully all of
the ramifications of any such application.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Neely was optimistic about the prospects for the deal,
because, she said, there is little overlap between the companies'
rail networks, which use the same computerized information systems.

A GOLDEN MORNING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By EVEN HENERSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They we're stunned, they were honored, they were ... deafened?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from her home in London, a somewhat congested Janet
McTeer said she had been concentrating on kicking a case of the flu
when she learned of her nomination for a Golden Globe award.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend from Fine Line called and screamed it in my ear,''
said McTeer, who was nominated for best actress in a comedy or
musical for her role in ``Tumbleweeds,'' ``It was the sort of noise
that deafens dogs, but I got the gist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted, because now a lot of other people will get to
see the film,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Another Brit, Anthony Minghella, had just arrived in New York,
where his new film ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' is scheduled to open
this week. He got off the plane and took a ``very good phone
call,'' learning that ``Ripley'' had snagged five nominations,
including one for Minghella's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm such a tortoise, I only finished this movie 10 days ago,''
said the Oscar-winning director of ``The English Patient.'' ``Just
to know there's some support for this is enormously encouraging. I
take these nominations very seriously indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten increasingly conscious of the expectation level
after 'The English Patient.' It's nice to know that I'm not a
one-hit wonder. I feel relieved, like I might get another job after
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Minghella handed plaudits to the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association for recognizing ``Ripley'' star Matt Damon's
``unsplashy and modest performance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The screenplay is so dignified by what he's done,'' Minghella
said. ``He's got some recognition without turning in a virtuoso
bells-and-whistles performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Writer-producer Armyan Bernstein had equally effusive words for
Damon's competition: Denzel Washington, who was also nominated for
best actor in a drama for his work in Bernstein's film, ``The
Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't just one of the best performances of the year;
this was one of the best performances ever,'' said Bernstein.
``I've been way overstated on this. I hope it doesn't come back to
haunt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day Monday, Bernstein spoke to the film's director,
Norman Jewison _ another nominee _ who was skiing in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just like one of those days to savor,'' Bernstein
said. ``You walk out, look at the sky and say 'thank you' to
whoever needs to be thanked.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who shook the early morning bleariness enough to digest
the nomination list were hard pressed to cite any voting trends.
That such critically praised movies as ``American Beauty'' and
``The Insider'' would pull in multiple nominees makes sense. But
how to account for Frank Darabont's ``The Green Mile'' netting only
one nomination, for supporting actor Michael Clarke Duncan and not
awards magnet Tom Hanks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh God, I wish I could comment on that,'' said Helmut Voss,
president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. ``This has
been a very quirky year as far as films are concerned. There really
has not been one film that blew everyone away. It was a wide-open
field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' writer Alan Ball accepted the invitation of
his Hollywood Hills neighbor _ and ``Beauty'' producer _ Dan Jinks
to watch the 5 a.m. announcements on television. Jinks, Ball and
fellow producer Bruce Cohen watched together. And celebrated
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know that, from a writing standpoint, I'm in very good
company,'' said Ball. ``I've been a big fan of John Irving
(nominated for ``The Cider House Rules'') since I read 'The World
According to Garp' in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read Charlie Kaufman's script for 'Being John Malkovich,'
and I thought it was very good.'' He also praised double nominee
Michael Mann, co-writer and director of ``The Insider.'' ``And I'm
not going to try to pronounce the name of the guy who wrote 'The
Sixth Sense.' (M. Night Shyamalan). I'm huge fans of all their
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday was a day when nominees around the world sent pithy
statements of thanks to their agents and publicists. From the
uninspired (``I'm very happy and honored to be nominated'' _ ``Toy
Story 2'' songwriter Randy Newman) to the gracious (``I am
completely delighted to be acknowledged for work that was such a
pleasure to do'' _ ``The Muse'' supporting actress Sharon Stone) to
the inside jokers (``I am very flattered. The readers of 'Horse and
Hound' will be thrilled'' _ best actor in a comedy nominee Hugh
Grant, who played a journalist-impersonating bookseller in
``Notting Hill'').
</P>
<P>
   And from ``Cider House'' actor, Michael Caine, who had more in
common with Janet McTeer Monday than being a Golden Globe nominee:
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting this news certainly brightened my day,'' Caine said in
a prepared statement, ``as I lie here in bed with the flu.'' &QL;

BOOK ADAPTATIONS OF '99 ARE CREAM OF THE CROP
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judging from this year's slate of holiday movies, it seems as
though studio executives must be spending some time in the library.
That, or they received a lot of gift certificates to Barnes &AMP; Noble
last year. Of the 30 major releases arriving in theaters in the
last two months of 1999, more than half are based on books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little scary,'' says director Scott Hicks, who made
David Guterson's best seller ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' as his
follow-up to ``Shine.'' ``You wonder if there's enough of an
audience for all these movies. I think there is, but it would be
nice if studios spaced the films out a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be breaking form. November and December are
traditionally the months when Hollywood puts aside (at least a
little bit) thoughts of commerce and deluges audiences with the
sort of mature, highbrow fare that Oscar voters love to honor.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's literary crop is an embarrassment of riches,
ranging from Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Angela's
Ashes'' to potboilers like Stephen King's ``The Green Mile.'' There
are classics (``Mansfield Park,'' ``Stuart Little,'' ``Sleepy
Hollow''), best sellers (``Girl, Interrupted,'' ``The Cider House
Rules''), literary cult favorites (``The End of the Affair,'' ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley'') and Oprah book club selections (``Anywhere
but Here'').
</P>
<P>
   All told, there are enough books-on-film to give movie and
literature lovers cause for joy _ and pause for thought. After all,
for every sterling adaptation (say, ``The English Patient'') there
are two or three clunkers like ``The Bonfire of the Vanities,''
movies that make the book's fans wish Hollywood hadn't bothered in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than a little intimidating, adapting a beloved book
like `Angela's Ashes,''' says director Alan Parker, who did exactly
that. McCourt's bittersweet memoir about growing up poor in Ireland
wasn't the first time Parker had made a movie in the Emerald Isle.
(Parker adapted Roddy Doyle's ``The Commitments'' in 1991.) But it
was the first time Parker had to deal with an author _ whose life
he was depicting _ on the set of his film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank McCourt was very encouraging,'' Parker says. ``But on
those days that he visited, I think he felt like he was intruding
on his own life. I felt a little uneasy myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Emily Watson, who plays McCourt's mother, Angela, in the
film: ``He seemed somewhat traumatized, like the world was picking
through the pieces of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   That same dynamic could be applied to the relationship between
director and author. Parker, Hicks and James Mangold, who directed
and co-wrote the adaptation of ``Girl, Interrupted,'' all expressed
a strong determination to satisfy both the author and the author's
audience with their movies. Part of that desire, Hicks says, comes
from the fact that directors know that Hollywood has butchered so
many literary adaptations over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're very mindful of those failures as you're making your
movie,'' Hicks says. ``I was also conscious of how intensely
possessive readers are of `Snow Falling on Cedars.' I felt like I
had an obligation to do right by them, not to mention David (the
book's author, David Guterson).''
</P>
<P>
   The danger of such a mindset, most filmmakers admit, is becoming
a slave to the book instead of making the book serve the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one reason why so many of these literary movies fail,''
says Douglas Wick, a producer who has been raiding the bookshelves
quite a bit lately. Wick's Red Wagon Productions is responsible for
``Girl, Interrupted,'' Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the two years she
spent as a teen in a psychiatric hospital, as well as ``Stuart
Little,'' an adaptation of the E.B. White children's classic. Wick
will also produce Steven Spielberg's film version of Arthur
Golden's best-selling ``Memoirs of a Geisha.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to fail a book is to make a lousy movie,'' Wick
says. ``When you adapt a book for the screen, you must make new
life occur. You can't just visualize the book, otherwise it's just
going to be a mediocre movie. You have to plant your own seeds,
remaining true to the spirit of the book, and hope something new
will grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Anthony Minghella took that approach when he adapted
Michael Ondaatje's novel, ``The English Patient,'' three years ago.
Now he's hoping lightning will strike again with his film version
of Patricia Highsmith's literary thriller, ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really used the same approach with both movies,'' says
Minghella, whose ``English Patient'' won nine Oscars, including
best picture and best director. ``I'm looking for the alchemy
between the reader and the novel. Highsmith's Ripley is seen as a
monster by some, but I wasn't interested in that. I was interested
in what I recognized about myself in the character, and that was a
fear of being alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an age,'' Minghella continues, ``where every
message is that we're inadequate, that we should should try to
change ourselves, change our nose or our hair or our wife or our
shoes. But it is not enough. And this pursuit of the fake somebody
instead of the real nobody is so germane and prescient, it seemed
worth exploring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some could, I suppose, see this as changing the novel, but I
see it as a layering process. And it's a process I believe
necessary when you're bringing a book to the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a process that won't be tapering off any time soon, not
with stars like Leonardo DiCaprio signing up for the film version
of Alex Garland's best seller ``The Beach.'' (The film is due in
February.) And, in fact, it's precisely because of the enthusiasm
of A-list talent like DiCaprio and Winona Ryder that so many
literary works are making their way into movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Says Ryder: ``It's better to initiate a project that you love,
like `Girl, Interrupted,' than sit around and hope that a
worthwhile script will come your way. I absolutely loved this book
and have spent six years getting it made into a movie. I've never
been so passionate about a film.''
</P>
<P>
   And she'd probably be hard-pressed to say that about a
big-screen version of ``I Dream of Jeannie.'' Indeed, with a
dwindling number of vintage television shows left to pillage (next
year brings ``Charlie's Angels,'' ``My Three Sons'' and a
``Mission: Impossible'' sequel), books provide Hollywood with
proven commodities that sometimes transcend commerce and become
works of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why there are so many of these movies right now,
but I'd like to think it's a reflection of the success of films
like `The English Patient' and `Shine,''' says ``Cedars'' director
Hicks. ``Those films were regarded as art-house fare and yet they
became huge box-office successes. I think studios saw that and
recognized there was an audience for films of substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Watson: ``It sure beats 'The Flintstones.''' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   With six nominations, including those for best film and best
director, the dark satire ``American Beauty'' led the way Monday
among this year's dramatic films in contention for Golden Globe
Awards. The film also earned a nomination for its director, Sam
Mendes, as did the four other films nominated as best: ``The End of
the Affair,'' directed by Neil Jordan; ``The Hurricane,'' directed
by Norman Jewison; ``The Insider,'' directed by Michael Mann and
``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' directed by Anthony Minghella.
</P>
<P>
   Nominations for best actress in a drama went to Annette Bening
for ``American Beauty,'' Julianne Moore for ``The End of the
Affair,'' Meryl Streep for ``Music of the Heart,'' Hilary Swank for
``Boys Don't Cry'' and Sigourney Weaver for ``A Map of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Nominations for best dramatic actor went to Russell Crowe for
``The Insider,'' Matt Damon for ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,''
Richard Farnsworth for ``The Straight Story,'' Kevin Spacey for
``American Beauty'' and Denzel Washington for ``The Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   The award ceremonies will be broadcast on NBC on Jan. 23. The
Golden Globe Awards are conferred by the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association, an organization of roughly 100 foreign journalists,
many of them free-lance and some of whom seldom see their work in

 &HT;    Inmates at Texas prison go on rampage, damage cellblock
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEEVILLE, Texas _ Dozens of rampaging convicts, freed from their
cells by a security breach, looted and heavily damaged their
cellblock early Monday at a maximum-security prison where a guard
was stabbed to death three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the uprising involving 80 convicts at the
McConnell Unit lasted just over three hours before specially
trained riot-suppression squads, firing pepper spray and tear gas,
regained control of the administrative segregation building about
7:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Three guards were injured, one for a severe gash on her arm and
two for exposure to the eye-watering gas. Officials said no
convicts were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   By late Monday, an uneasy calm remained at the 2,900-man prison.
All convicts remained locked in their cells as guards conducted a
cell-by-cell search for weapons and contraband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we don't think this was the result any organized
effort, but rather one inmate who was able to get out of his cell,
seize control of a security post and then let the others out,''
said Gary Johnson, director of the prisons division of the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no indication of negligence up to this point, but we
want to know how this inmate got into that (security) post.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the riot, the first in a Texas prison since
100 convicts heavily damaged the Briscoe Unit in Dilley in March
1995, began about 3:45 a.m. when convict William Steed Kelley, 31,
jimmied his cell door open and forced his way into the cellblock's
security post, located at the center of the building and surrounded
by cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a shank (a sharpened piece of metal),'' Johnson said.
``In order to get in that post he had to come through two doors
that should have been locked. How he got through those two doors is
something that's part of our investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said the guards who electronically opened at
least one of the doors for Kelley has worked at the prison only
since July. She was being interviewed by investigators, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and other officials confirmed that the cell doors at the
McConnell Unit are like those that have been prone to being jimmied
open at other prisons in the past. By late Monday, a team of prison
security specialists were at McConnell to review damage and
recommend immediate modifications at 10 other prisons with the same
type of cell doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want this to happen again,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   After Kelley slashed one officer, and started ``punching all the
buttons'' to open the 84 cell doors, both inmate and officer fled
the control room, said Larry Todd, a spokesman for the prison
agency. One of the cells was vacant and three inmates did not take
part in the riots, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A third guard escaped into an adjacent exercise yard and scaled
the fence. Todd said co-workers used wire cutters to allow him an
escape route a few moments late, as the riot began.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were breaking all the windows, smashing the equipment in
the control room, pulling their mattresses out _ trying to destroy
everything they could,'' Todd said. ``Then they tore the rails off
their bunks and used them as battering rams. Vandalism is too
understated for what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, a general alarm had been sounded throughout the
prison. Steel riot doors were locked across a hallway to keep the
rioters inside their cellblock. Initial efforts to quell the melee
with pepper spray failed, officials said, and within two hours more
than 100 guards and riot specialists had been assembled at the
prison to retake the cellblock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inmates used towels under the doors to keep out the gas
and a number were running around with wet towels across their faces
for the same reason,'' Todd said. ``It took some time, but control
was re-established.''
</P>
<P>
   That came about 7:15 a.m., Johnson said, when riot teams wearing
gas masks stormed the cellblock behind a cloud of eye-irritating
gas and quickly took custody of the rioters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inmates offered little resistance,'' Johnson said. ``At no
point were we in any danger of losing the unit as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Todd said that throughout the morning _ as guards
stripped the rioters to their boxer shorts and led them in
handcuffs to a gymnasium for interrogation and medical checks _
some rioters continued trying to fight. ``We have some who remain
very belligerent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday afternoon, a line of white prison busses and vans were
lined up outside the prison to begin transferring the rioters to
other maximum-security prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Damage to the cellblock was still being tallied, but Johnson
said he hopes it can be back in service within a month. The 84
cells affected by Monday's riot are among 504 in the high-security
building at the prison, which was opened in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Todd said officials plan to seek charges of attempted capital
murder and inciting a riot against Kelley. He is already serving a
99-year term from Houston for attempted murder and aggravated
sexual assault with a deadly weapon. The attempted murder charge
involved a 1991 attack on another inmate at the Coffield unit near
Palestine, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the ongoing investigation into the riot, officials would
not identify the injured guards but said two were treated at a
hospital and one was treated at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The uprising was the latest violence at the prison. Daniel
Nagle, 37, a correctional officer since June 1996, was found
stabbed to death Friday in a hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Nagle _ a local union official who has been working for a pay
raise for guards, citing the dangerousness of the work _ was the
first prison guard killed in the line of duty since 1982, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Correctional officers and family members complained Monday that
the riot highlights that danger, heightened by a staffing shortage
of more than 1,000 prison guards short statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prisons are a powderkeg waiting to explode,'' said Lidia
Torres, 37, who said her brother is a McConnell employee. ``How
many more people have to be killed before something is done.''
</P>
<P>

Texas.

DEPORTATION THREAT FOR SHOPLIFTING RAISES CONCERN ABOUT LAW'S
FAIRNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ERIC LIPTON   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ She prefers barbecued ribs to her mother's
homemade lasagna. Her sons wear their Yankees caps backward and
spend afternoons shooting hoops at their local schools. Her aunts,
uncles, bothers, sisters and husband, a Rochester native, all live
in this western New York community, which she considers her
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   But after being repeatedly convicted of shoplifting a total of
less than $500 in goods _ items such as eyedrops, cigarettes and
roll-on deodorant _ Maria Wigent, 37, is being held in a county
jail awaiting deportation next month to Italy, a country where she
has not been since she was 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a drug lord. I'm not a terrorist. I am just a
housewife who got mixed up and made a mistake,'' Mrs. Wigent said.
``How can they just take me away from my country, from my husband
of 16 years, my sons and my friends? This is my country. Italy is
not. It's just where I was born.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wigent's predicament may seem extreme. But it has become so
common in recent years that even sponsors of tough deportation laws
enacted by Congress in 1996 are saying that the law _ or at least
its enforcement _ is now too tough.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Immigration and Naturalization Service
deported 62,359 immigrants with criminal records in the 1999 fiscal
year. That is up 72 percent since Congress expanded the types of
crimes that can result in deportation, including some nonviolent
offenses such as felony shoplifting. The new law also prohibits
those convicted of so-called aggravated felonies from applying for
deportation waivers and it permits people to be deported even if
they committed their crimes decades ago and served their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a just and fair nation and must strike a just and fair
balance in our immigration laws,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum. The
Florida Republican was a co-sponsor of the 1996 legislation, but
has sponsored one of five recently introduced bills that would
amend it.. Added Representative Brian P. Bilbray, a California
Republican who was another co-sponsor of the 1996 legislation: ``We
have a responsibility to go in and do a little tweaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Urged on by Congress, the INS is preparing a new policy on how
to handle deportation cases involving less serious offenses, said
Russell A. Bergeron Jr., a spokesman for the agency, although he
said the agency preferred that Congress revise the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been able to rid American society of some people I
don't think anyone would dispute should be removed from the
country,'' Bergeron said, noting that people convicted of murder
and child abuse have been among those deported. ``But the 1996 act
went too far in some respects.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no solid estimates of how many immigrants convicted of
less-serious crimes like Mrs. Wigent's are being deported each
year, but there is agreement by both supporters and opponents of
the 1996 legislation that the number is at least in the hundreds
annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would never think you would get rearrested for something
that you already paid for,'' said Jose M. Valesquez, a native of
Panama, who served three years' probation after being convicted in
1980 of conspiracy with the intent to distribute narcotics.
Valesquez was detained by the INS after returning from a visit to
his mother in Panama last December, and is free on bond while
awaiting a deportation hearing. He acknowledges that he used drugs
20 years ago, but says he never sold drugs and has lived a
law-abiding life as a suburban Philadelphia deli owner since. ``You
see this in movies where it happens in other countries, but never
in United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wigent's case has captured widespread attention in
Rochester, a city with a large Italian immigrant community. She,
her four brothers and sisters and parents came to the United States
in 1968. Most of her aunts, uncles and cousins have also left their
native city of Albi behind. Francesco Gaglianese, 68, and Anna
Gaglianese, 58, Mrs. Wigent's parents, still speak Italian in their
modest, two-story home. But the family has integrated into their
adopted community, with her father, who is retired, spending 31
years as a laborer building homes. Her mother was a school
custodian.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wigent, who dropped out of high school, married a
short-order cook from Rochester, Larry Wigent, when she was 21. Two
sons soon followed, Larry Wigent Jr., now 15, and Louis Wigent, 14.
Her husband and two sons are United States citizens. Mrs. Wigent
said she mistakenly believed that by marrying a citizen, she became
one too.
</P>
<P>
   Her trouble began in October 1994, when Mrs. Wigent, who had
been working in a series of fast-food restaurants and clothing
stores, began a shoplifting spree. On 17 occasions, she was
arrested for petty larceny or attempted petty larceny, generally
after being caught with inexpensive items such as cigarettes, court
records say. She pleaded guilty each time, paying small fines. The
convictions made her vulnerable to deportation in 1998, when upon
the advice of a public defender, she said, she pleaded guilty to
her two final larceny charges and a probation violation and was
given a two-year jail sentence. That conviction fell under the 1996
law's definition of an aggravated felony, which applies to a range
a crimes from murder to theft.
</P>
<P>
   A Rochester psychologist diagnosed Mrs. Wigent last month as
suffering from impulse-control disorder, commonly known as
kleptomania, court records show, citing in part marital
difficulties. Mrs. Wigent and her family do not dispute she
deserved punishment for the shoplifting offenses.
</P>
<P>
   But deporting Mrs. Wigent to Italy, they said, is a lifetime
sentence they consider far too extreme. Her family hired a new
lawyer, who asked a Rochester judge to vacate Mrs. Wigent's most
recent convictions, arguing that the public defender had an
obligation to inform her that a guilty plea could result in
deportation. The request was denied last week, and Mrs. Wigent is
scheduled to be deported Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of being sent to Italy _ without the right ever to
return_ terrifies Mrs. Wigent, who cannot read or write Italian In
an interview last week at a county jail in Wyoming, N.Y., she said
she knew of only one relative there, an elderly aunt who lives in a
convent in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like I am in a dream and someone needs to
wake me up,'' said Mrs. Wigent, whose prison-issue blue uniform was
distinguished only by a cross and a charm of St. Barbara that hung
on a necklace, and her gold-and-diamond wedding ring. ``How can
they take my life away from me?''
</P>
<P>
   A petition drive has started in Rochester. A local newspaper
columnist has taken up her cause, writing a column headlined,
``Maria Wigent is no saint, but deporting her does not serve
justice.'' Her lawyer, Jeffrey M. Jayson, is appealing the
Rochester judge's ruling. Her sons are living with her parents,
wondering just what will happen if their mother is sent away for
good. ``I thought she would always be here,'' Louis Wigent said
last week.

</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Wigent waits for her fate to be decided, others like
her are already back in their native lands. There is Tony El-Dib,
35, of Manhattan, deported to his native Lebanon last month, after
a 1998 bank-fraud conviction related to credit-card abuse. Sergio
A. Sandoval, 38, meanwhile, was dropped off in a border town in
Mexico on Dec. 1. He and his family left their native Mexico in
1964, moving to California. His deportation came after he served a
30-month sentence in Nevada for driving under the influence, his
third alcohol-related driving offense. None resulted in an accident
or injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am only really about 10 minutes away from the border, but it
feels like a million miles,'' said Sandoval, a Marine &UR;  &LR; veteran who
is temporarily living &UR;  &LR; with a minister he met in Nogales, Mexico.
``What am I going to do? Where am I going to go?''
</P>
<P>
   The deportation of Sandoval and hundreds of others like him has
heightened opposition to the 1996 legislation. A woman in Mesquite,
Texas, whose husband served three years in jail after being
convicted of possession of amphetamines in 1989 and who now faces
deportation to Canada, has formed a group called Citizens and
Immigrants for Equal Justice. It started with five families; today
there are about 500 families in 26 states, the Mesquite womam,
Laurie Kozuba, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many families out there that just cannot survive
without some relief coming soon,'' Mrs. Kozuba said.
</P>
<P>
   National organizations, including the American Civil Liberties
Union, the National Immigration Forum and the American Immigration
Lawyers Association, have taken up the cause. Last summer, they
initiated a ``Fix '96'' campaign calling for amendments to the law.
Among other changes, the amendments would allow immigrants
convicted of less serious crimes to apply for deportation waivers.
Current federal law prohibits any special circumstances _ or
consideration of evidence of rehabilitation _ for those convicted
of an aggravated felony.
</P>
<P>
   Five bills are pending in the House or Representatives and two
in the Senate calling for changes in the 1996 immigration law. The
first, introduced in April by Rep. Barney Frank, Democrat of
Massachusetts, has 74 co-sponsors, including six Republicans. It
would allow long-term legal immigrants to seek a waiver to a
deportation order.
</P>
<P>
   Like Frank's bill, McCollum's proposal, introduced in October,
would allow certain people who were deported but not convicted of
serious violent crimes to apply for reentry to the United States.
McCollum developed his plan after he asked Congress to grant
special relief to Robert A. Broley, the son of the former
Republican Party treasurer in Orange County, Fla., who was deported
to Canada last year after he was convicted of felony theft and
fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   These bills, along with two others in the House, have been
referred to a House Judiciary Committee panel headed by Rep. Lamar
Smith, a Texas Republican who was the House sponsor of the 1996
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Smith agrees that the law has, at times, been enforced unfairly.
He helped draft a letter sent last month to Attorney General Janet
Reno, signed by 28 Republicans and Democrats, noting that ``there
has been widespread agreement that some deportations were unfair
and resulted in unjustified hardship.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith is opposed to amending the law, maintaining that the
Department of Justice and the Immigration and Naturalization
Service can address the problem by choosing not to pursue
deportation claims against immigrants convicted of less-serious
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutors across the U.S. make decisions every day about who
they will prosecute,'' Smith said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron, the INS spokesman, said that his agency would much
prefer that Congress modify the law. But the immigration service is
preparing a policy that would establish guidelines for its 33
district offices and other entry points into the United States
detailing what kinds of cases its staff could chose under certain
circumstances not to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are left with no other alternative,'' the agency would
likely put such a policy into effect, Bergeron said, although he
would not offer a starting date.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration advocates also object to merely making an
administrative change, noting that legal immigrants with relatively
minor criminal convictions could never be assured that they would
not suddenly be subject to a deportation proceeding. They would
continue to be at particular risk when they try to reenter the
United States after a visit to another country.
</P>
<P>
   But immigration advocates and families of those facing
deportation are encouraged that the debate has at least started in
Washington. ``It is far from a done deal, but some of the right
ingredients are there,'' said Angela Kelley, deputy director of the
National Immigration Forum. ``There is an unmistakable smell in the
air of the need for change.''

 &HT;    `A madhouse' as shoppers spend billions
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta retailers are all smiles going into the
last four shopping days before Christmas. Sales are up 5.8 percent
through Dec. 19, compared with 2.8 percent at this time last year,
according to First Data Corp.'s TeleCheck index. TeleCheck tracks
check writing, which accounts for about one-third of retail
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Saturday) was the busiest I've seen it yet,'' said Lenox
Square spokesman Jeff Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   At Arbor Place in Douglasville, Ga., the mall has room for 6,000
vehicles at one time, but more than 30,000 vehicles packed its
parking lot throughout the day, equaling about 51,000 shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   But what could really keep storefront retailers smiling over the
next few days is this: As of Dec. 15, more than 75 percent of
Americans still had not finished their gift buying, according to a
holiday survey conducted by International Mass Retail Association
in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   With Christmas about over for Internet retailers because of
delivery constraints, the evergreen procrastinators are showing up
at retailers' doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week is going to be a madhouse because the Internet is no
longer an option,'' said David Herskovits, a partner in the Atlanta
office of Deloitte &AMP; Touche accounting and consulting firm.
Internet holiday sales are expected to reach $8 billion to $10
billion this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw earlier holiday buying to be more e-commere-based and
the later buying frenzy is going to be more store-based,''
Herskovits said.
</P>
<P>
   What's really giving the holiday season a kick is that consumers
are splurging on everything from digital cameras to diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Music, video and home entertainment purchases topped the list
with the biggest increases in sales over last year _ at 13.7
percent _ for Dec. 13-19, according to the latest International
Council of Shopping Centers survey. The survey covered 70 regional
malls around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hottest items are digital cameras, without question,''
said Wayne Freedman, a spokesman for Alpharetta, Ga.-based Wolf
Camera, a chain of 720 stores in 30 states.
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry sales also sparkled, with an increase of 9.7 percent.
``People are buying diamonds, bigger than ever before,'' said Ken
Gassman Jr., an analyst with Davenport &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Other categories that showed increases include footwear, with a
6.8 percent increase, followed by apparel at 4.7 percent over last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, retail sales growth for the past week topped 6.8
percent nationally from a year ago, the ICSC found. Holiday sales
could be up anywhere from 5 percent to 7 percent for the entire
season, analysts predict.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Vitner, a First Union economist in Charlotte, N.C.,
predicts overall sales will be up around 12 percent for metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strong enough,'' Vitner said, ``that we're going to have
the best holiday season since 1992.''

SCHOOL VOUCHER PROGRAM IN CLEVELAND IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, FEDERAL
JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled on Monday that a program giving thousands
of Cleveland children taxpayer-financed vouchers to attend
parochial schools violates the Constitution's separation of church
and state.
</P>
<P>
   The closely watched case, which concerns one of the most
contentious issues in education, has been the subject of debate in
the presidential campaign and is widely expected to be reviewed by
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. of Federal District Court in Cleveland
wrote that the voucher program, enacted by the Ohio Legislature in
1995, ``has the effect of advancing religion through
government-sponsored religious indoctrination.'' Noting that nearly
all the students receiving vouchers attend parochial schools, he
added, ``A program that is so skewed toward religion necessarily
results in indoctrination attributable to the government and
provides financial incentives to attend religious schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is the latest in a series of legal victories for
those opposing vouchers, but proponents have nonetheless gathered
political steam as states continue to fashion new voucher programs.
The governor and attorney general of Ohio vowed immediately to
appeal the decision, and all parties to the case agreed to let
children continue attending schools under the voucher program until
the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals considers the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very disappointed with today's ruling because I believe
it takes away a valuable option for Cleveland parents and
students,'' Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio, a Republican, said in a
statement. ``It interrupts an experiment that can shed light on how
best to move forward with education reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was filed by a coalition of civil liberties groups and
teachers unions, which contended that the vouchers violated the
First Amendment's prohibition on government establishment of
religion and presented a major threat to the public school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxpayer dollars should be put to work in the public schools,
where they belong, and not be used to subsidize someone's
religion,'' said Carole Shields, president of People for the
American Way, a Washington group that was among those supporting
the plaintiffs. ``The country would be wise to support proven
education reforms, such as smaller classes, and not this voucher
gimmick that's leaving children, parents and taxpayers high and
dry.''
</P>
<P>
   But Christine Suma, a Cleveland mother of 12 who has three
children attending Our Lady of Counsel under the voucher program,
called Oliver ``the Grinch who stole Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision ``leaves a lot of parents on a yo-yo,'' said Mrs.
Suma, who was among the defendants named in the lawsuit. ``I won't
risk my children's lives and future in education. If I had my
children in the Cleveland public schools, I wouldn't have much
say-so.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Cleveland program, 3,761 elementary schoolchildren
receive up to $2,500 in state money toward tuition at one of 56
approved private schools, more than 80 percent of which are
religious. Currently, 96 percent of the students receiving vouchers
attend one of the parochial schools, a point emphasized throughout
Oliver's ruling. Most of those receiving the vouchers are poor.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-page court decision opens with a litany of examples of
the schools' religious nature.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Patrick, one of several Catholic schools involved in the
program, the student handbook says the No. 1 objective of education
is ``to communicate the gospel message of Jesus.'' Parents are
warned that ``religious truths and values'' permeate the whole
atmosphere of the school at St. Rocco, another Catholic
institution, and that even non-Catholic students must attend
religion classes and prayers. St. John Nottingham, a Lutheran
school, promises to teach ``reading, mathematics, spelling,
language, social studies and handwriting with a Christ-centered
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike programs using taxpayer money to defray the costs of
parochial school education that have been upheld by the Supreme
Court, Oliver said that in the Cleveland voucher program, ``it can
generally be said that a central part of each school's program is
instruction in the theology or doctrine of a particular faith and
that religion and religious doctrines are an integral part of the
entire school experience.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ruling quoted Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, framers of
the constitutional prohibition against mingling church and state,
and suggested that the core values of the country are at stake.
Oliver rested his decision largely on a 1973 case known as
Community for Public Education and Religious Liberty vs. Nyquist,
in which the Supreme Court rejected a New York state program that
gave parents $50 or $100 toward tuition at private and parochial
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the program in Nyquist, there `has been no endeavor to
guarantee the separation between secular and religious educational
functions and to ensure the state financial aid supports only the
former,''' Oliver wrote. ``The effect of the aid is unmistakably to
provide desired financial support for nonpublic, sectarian
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver also reviewed in detail several Supreme Court cases that
have allowed taxpayer money to be funneled to parochial schools,
but said each was far narrower and thus less problematic than the
Cleveland program.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's was the first program to allow vouchers to be used
for religious schools, though there is now a similar program in
Milwaukee upheld by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme
Court declined to review the Wisconsin ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's decision comes after state supreme courts in Maine and
Vermont have ruled that voucher programs there may exclude
parochial schools, and as Florida begins the first statewide
voucher program. In August, the day before school was to start,
Oliver temporarily blocked students from attending school using the
vouchers, then backtracked several days later amid parental
protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court took the unusual step of intervening in the
Cleveland case in November to guarantee the program's survival
until the appeals court rules. That, combined with the clarity of
the issues in the Cleveland case, is one of many reasons why
lawyers and advocates on both sides believe it is likely to gain
Supreme Court review.
</P>
<P>
   Though litigation typically centers on the church-state
question, vouchers are also controversial because of their
potential impact on public education. Liberals fear that vouchers
will drain badly needed resources and motivated children away from
already struggling public schools; conservatives see vouchers as a
competitive market force that will push public schools to improve
or die.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has figured prominently in the presidential campaign.
Republicans have lined up behind vouchers, while Vice President Al
Gore has attacked his Democratic challenger, Bill Bradley, for
voting in favor of vouchers while he was in the Senate. Bradley
said in a televised debate Sunday that he had supported programs
like Cleveland's only as experiments, adding, ``I do not believe
that vouchers are the answers to the problems of public
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, who was appointed by President Clinton in 1994, is
widely considered to be a staunch opponent of vouchers. He was once
on the board of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, which later was part of a coalition opposing
vouchers.

 BUSH AND McCAIN SEE SOUTH CAROLINA AS A MUST WIN   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Ever since Ronald Reagan's victory here in 1980
put it on the map, the South Carolina primary has had a central
place in Republican politics. Sen. John McCain and Gov. George W.
Bush are certainly campaigning as if the state is pivotal in their
fight for the party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he surges in New Hampshire, McCain is citing South
Carolina's ``transcendent importance'' to his candidacy, stopping
just short of declaring that a loss here would end his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very complicated strategy we have,'' he said the
other day in Charleston, where he conjured up images of D-Day.
``It's very similar to that of the landing at Normandy: win South
Carolina. Every page says, `Win South Carolina.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose record as a Navy aviator plays well among the
state's many veterans and active military personnel, pledged to be
here ``literally every day'' between the New Hampshire primary on
Feb. 1 and South Carolina's own balloting 18 days later. Shortly
after South Carolina come the multiple-primary days in far-flung
states where Bush's advantage in organization and resources could
prove overwhelming if he is not weakened by then.
</P>
<P>
   Bush showed up in South Carolina a day after McCain and
similarly emphasized its importance. Promoting his tax-cut proposal
in the town of Camden, he reminded the state's voters of their
legacy of restoring Republican front-runners who have stumbled, as
if he himself might need rescue after New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina's had a tradition,'' he said, ``of when
somebody thinks the door is open, of slamming it shut. It's been an
important state regardless of what happens in the early states.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush should know. His father dashed the hopes of Bob Dole and
Pat Robertson here in 1988, beginning the Southern sweep that
cemented the nomination. Four years later President Bush used South
Carolina as a firewall to stop Pat Buchanan, who had made an
unexpectedly strong showing in New Hampshire. South Carolina also
helped revive Dole in 1996 after New Hampshire had gone to
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, once again, much of the state's Republican establishment
has rallied to the side of a front-runner, and of a member of the
Bush clan. Bush has endorsements from leaders including Sen. Strom
Thurmond, former Gov. Carroll Campbell, former Gov. David Beasley,
Lt. Gov. Bob Peeler, State Attorney General Charlie Condon and
David H. Wilkins, speaker of the South Carolina House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say Bush not only has inherited his father's South
Carolina political machine but also is benefiting from the
affection in which his parents are still held by voters here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps him a lot, his mother and father,'' said Henry
McMaster, the Republican state chairman, who is remaining neutral.
``Governor Campbell had them down so much that people thought they
lived here.''

<P>
   Then there are the general electoral inclinations of the state's
Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think we have a much different electorate down here,''
said Heath Thompson, the state director of the Bush campaign.
``Besides being more contrarian, the voters in New Hampshire are
considered more independent. While we may like to think of
ourselves as independent, the independents among us are still very
conservative.''
</P>

   Republicans tend to be far less insurgent than institutional
here, in a state that reveres institutions (witness the Confederate
battle flag that still flies over the Capitol or the new statue
nearby of Strom Thurmond, erected in testimony to his stature at
age 97 as the longest serving U.S. senator in history.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical Christians also make up a high proportion of the
electorate. McCain, however, hopes to make inroads though his
personal history as a prisoner of war in a state that has the
highest proportion in the nation of veterans and active duty
military personnel. McCain's supporters argue that the support of
the Republican establishment does not mean what it once did before
Republicans lost the governor's seat to Jim Hodges, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, McCain's advisers have their own South Carolina model
to point to: Ronald Reagan's 1980 primary victory here over the
former governor of Texas, John Connally, who campaigned intensively
in South Carolina and was the favorite of the local Republican
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Quinn, a lanky, soft-spoken political strategist, worked
in Reagan's South Carolina campaign then and is McCain's local
strategist now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an interesting comparison between 1980 and 1999,'' he
said. ``It was kind of a Who's Who of the Republican leadership
structure who was for Connally.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a comparison to Bush, he added that Connally ``was
leading Reagan in the polls. He was raising far more money than
Reagan. He had the endorsements and the money behind him and he was
from Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn also argued that Buchanan had not been able to capitalize
on his New Hampshire showings here in part because he had never
built an organization or media presence in the state. But McCain
has, with chairmen and veterans chairmen in all 46 counties.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has also picked up endorsements from his own share
of party officials including Terry Haskins, the house speaker pro
tem, and two members of Congress, Reps. Lindsey Graham and Mark
Sanford, both young Turks from the Republican class of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago you would have had two congressmen going against
the machine and it wouldn't matter,'' said Graham, who has achieved
folk hero status in his state for his high-profile role in
President Clinton's impeachment trial. ``It matters now. Things are
up for grabs now.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes too has been organizing here, reaching out in
particular to anti-tax activists and Christian conservatives.
Friday, on the first day of a bus tour across the state, he
emphasized his stand against abortion. But Republican state
officials say that as of yet, he is not posing a threat to Bush and
McCain. The three other candidates _ Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch
and Alan Keyes _ are not given much of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush is still the heavy favorite. A CNN/Time poll in
late November found that 62 percent of likely primary voters
favored Bush versus 15 percent for McCain. Forbes was third with 6
percent. Even Bush's aides expect the race to tighten and McMaster,
the Republican chairman, calls the race fluid. ``I just see it as a
wide open contest that's almost unpredictable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain believes he has some natural advantages to build on in
South Carolina, starting with the 450,000 veterans and active duty
military personnel here. In addition, independents and Democrats
are allowed to vote in the Republican primary and might be attuned
to his stance as a maverick fighting special interests, although
the state has not had much history of such cross-party voting.
</P>
<P>
   At The Flight Deck restaurant in Lexington, the senator on
Wednesday went out of his way to portray himself as the man
fighting the establishment, as he looked at a giant three-D figure
of King Kong protruding from a wall and gripping an Empire State
Building in one fist and a World War I era plane in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's almost like our campaign,'' McCain said. ``Really.
We've got a big King Kong up there on the top of the building with
all the money and all the establishment and I'm the guy in the
airplane there strafing them,'' he said. Then with Borscht-belt
timing he added, eyeing the ape, ``in fact it looks a lot like
Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   As the audience laughed, he added, under his breath, ``We're
running a positive campaign here.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who was accompanying him, also sought to use the
Lewinsky scandal to help the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the first president post-Clinton,'' the
congressman reminded the breakfast crowd. ``We're going to have to
elect a man that's ready to clean that place up.'' Introducing
McCain, he said, ``Wouldn't it be nice to have a commander-in-chief
that actually understood how the military worked? Wouldn't it be
proud to have someone that when they came on the news you didn't
have to take the kids out of the room?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has worked hard to neutralize McCain's potential strengths.
The governor has stressed military and veterans issues here and he
chose to deliver his speech this fall on national security at the
Citadel, South Carolina's revered military academy. One of the two
television commercials the governor has on the air here showcases
his stance on military matters and support of an anti-ballistic
missile system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not conceding any political turf to anyone,'' said
Thompson. ``We feel like we're not going to concede veterans to
Senator McCain any more than we did the women's vote to Elizabeth
Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain now has two television commercials in rotation here and
three 60-second radio spots, and two of the radio commercials
feature a fellow Vietnam prisoner of war, Col. Bud Day.
</P>
<P>
   For now, rank-and-file Republicans showing uat McCain's events
seem far from decided. After McCain unveiled a health care plan at
a Rotary Club lunch in Charleston, Betty Dronen, 71, said she was
leaning his way. But she added, ``If Bush would approach some of
these same issues and explain what he would do, that might make a
difference.''

NEW YORK MAYOR WENT TOO FAR IN TRYING TO CLOSE SEX SHOPS, COURT
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York state's highest court ruled Monday that
the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani overstepped its bounds
in trying to shut down pornography businesses, a decision that
affects dozens of stores and is by far the mayor's worst setback in
his campaign to restrict X-rated bookstores and theaters.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the plaintiffs said the ruling by the Court of
Appeals could keep the doors open at as many as 80 pornography
businesses that the city had ordered shuttered, but a city lawyer
put the number at 25 to 30. City officials said they would look for
ways around the ruling, so that they could continue to reduce the
number of X-rated businesses. But the decision raises the
possibility that new businesses could crop up to take advantage of
the court's edict, reversing some of the success Giuliani has had
in driving them out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision did not address the 1995 city zoning law,
championed by Giuliani and upheld by the Court of Appeals, that
sharply restricted where in the city peep shows, strip clubs and
hard-core book and video stores could be operated. Instead, it
dealt with a regulation the city had adopted, defining what is an
``adult'' business.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous ruling, the court said that the administration's
interpretation was overly broad, and that it had tried to close
down a business that was actually complying with the law _ in this
case, an Upper West Side video store catering to gay men. That
reversed decisions by a Manhattan trial court and the Appellate
Division of state Supreme Court, which had supported the city's
stand.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday in Union Square, the mayor said the
Court of Appeals' decision ``will have some effect on'' the
campaign against sex-related book and video stores, but he noted
that it would not hinder efforts to close strip clubs ``that were a
key problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Herald Price Fahringer, the lawyer for the X-rated store
that had sued the city, said that Monday's decision was another in
a long string of setbacks in court for Giuliani, as judges have
concluded that his administration was overzealous in pursuit of his
policies _ cases varying from questions of free speech to welfare
policy. In recent weeks, a federal court blocked the mayor's
attempt to cut off city financing for the Brooklyn Museum over a
controversial exhibition, a state Supreme Court justice blocked his
plan to require the homeless to work in return for shelter, and the
Court of Appeals found that his administration had illegally taxed
thousands of its employees.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani has been notably more successful in chasing
sex-related businesses out of neighborhoods and tourist-heavy
sections like Times Square, winning a long string of court
victories. By the city's count, since enforcement of the law began
in August 1998, 62 of 144 sex-related businesses have either been
forcibly closed by the police or, under that threat, have
voluntarily gone out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 law banned any business where a ``substantial portion''
of it was devoted to X-rated material or nude performances, and was
within 500 feet of a school, church or residential area, or of
another pornography business. That relegated the businesses mostly
to industrial zones, far from the eyes of most city residents and
tourists. The restrictions were welcomed in many neighborhoods _
particularly in Queens, where strip clubs had cropped up in several
residential areas _ and by businesses in the newly sanitized,
tourist-friendly Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   When the law was challenged on First Amendment grounds as a
violation of free speech rights, the city was careful to insist
that it was not trying to restrict the content of what was sold in
the stores _ an approach that state and federal courts had made
clear they would not accept. Instead, the city argued that the law
was meant to curb dangerous activity that it said X-rated
businesses attracted, like prostitution and drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In response to complaints that the ``substantial portion''
standard was too vague, the administration adopted a rule defining
that phrase to mean that 40 percent or more of a business' floor
space, or of the merchandise on display, was adults-only. That
satisfied the Court of Appeals, which unanimously upheld the law in
February 1998. In July 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to
hear an appeal, clearing the way for enforcement of the law to
begin.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses, particularly book and video stores, tried to
stay open by making sure that 60 percent or more of their display
stock was not pornographic, which often meant lining their stores
with videos of cartoons, wrestling and karate movies that sold
scantly, if at all. The case decided Monday dealt with Les Hommes,
a store at 217 W. 80th St., where, a trial court concluded, 24
percent of the material on display was X-rated.
</P>
<P>
   The city, calling this ``sham compliance,'' moved to close Les
Hommes and similar businesses, noting that their new, more
pedestrian stock did not sell anywhere nearly as briskly as the
salacious material they had all along. Les Hommes sells videos of
all kinds, but only the X-rated videos are offered for rent, a fact
that the city cited as evidence that the sexually explicit material
was the real business and the rest was a front.
</P>
<P>
   But in the city regulation, ``the focus is solely on the
appropriate percentages of stock and floor and cellar space, and
the city drew these at 40 percent,'' Judge Carmen Beauchamp
Ciparick wrote for the court. ``The city's guidelines provide no
support for the view that profitability or stability of the
nonadult stock need be considered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' she wrote, ``we must enforce the city's
administrative guidelines as written.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Connolly, special counsel to Corporation Counsel Michael
Hess, the city's chief lawyer, said the court's treatment of the 40
percent rule ``has taken a small loophole and made it a gaping hole
for people who have no intention of complying with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he warned against ``interpreting this too broadly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fahringer, the lawyer for Les Hommes, the plaintiff, and
Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties
Union, both said the decision could not only save many existing
businesses, it could clear the way for new ones to open outside the
areas permitted by the 1995 law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court has said 40 percent means 40 percent, and the city
can't go interpreting that as it pleases,'' Fahringer said.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Les Hommes, which has operated for two decades,
declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly pointed to one cryptic sentence in Monday's ruling, in
which the court said there might be instances ``where what a store
is selling or renting cannot be considered stock'' for the purposes
of the 40 percent rule, but did not elaborate. He said city lawyers
were trying to determine whether that line opened the door to
continued enforcement of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said that the city was studying several options,
including the adoption of a new regulation that would give it
greater leeway in interpreting the 40 percent rule. But Fahringer
and Siegel, who had vigorously opposed the law, said it would be
difficult to do so without having the city explicitly judging the
content of the material on sale, which a court would be likely to
judge unconstitutional.

AMERICA'S CHIEF U.N. DELEGATE CHARTS HIS COURSE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Richard Holbrooke's moment has come, and he
intends to make the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   With a long and bedeviled nomination process and the battle to
pay American dues to the United Nations now behind him, he has one
year left as chief American representative here, one year to put
his imprint on Washington's relations with the world and perhaps to
emerge again as a leading candidate for secretary of state after
the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Almost four months after taking office here and picking up a
cabinet seat at the White House, Holbrooke called his first major
news conference Monday to talk about his plans for January, when he
takes on the rotating presidency of the Security Council and can
frame much of its agenda. In a word, it will be Africa. Not Iraq,
not Kosovo or Bosnia, not North Korea or East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a gimmick,'' said Holbrooke, who is an expert on
Europe and Asia. Back from his first extended tour of sub-Saharan
Africa, he was shaken by what he saw: the endless implosion of
Angola, a pointless war in Congo and the social and economic
devastation of .
</P>
<P>
   With Secretary of State Madeleine Albright now focused on the
Middle East, and with events in the Balkans and East Timor largely
under U.N. or NATO control, Africa looms as the great unfinished
business at the century's end. Holbrooke plans public Security
Council sessions on Burundi, Congo and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Many diplomats are skeptical. Council debates on Africa have
often turned into speechfests that change nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But Africans and envoys from other developing nations are
welcoming the attention. At the Center for the Global South at
American University in Washington, the director, Clovis Maksoud,
said that Holbrooke might strike the right chord with poorer
nations, finding a way to line up their support, much of which has
been lost in recent years because of fears of unrestrained American
power.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke is more willing than most diplomats to be openly
critical of African leadership and the slow-motion responses to
crises of the Organization of African Unity. To underline the folly
of neglecting AIDS in many countries, he said he would set aside a
day for AIDS in Africa, particularly southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people wonder, why hold a Security Council meeting on a
health issue?'' he said. ``There has never been a Security Council
meeting on a health issue. The reason is simple. In Africa, in
southern Africa, in countries like Namibia and South Africa,
Zimbabwe and other countries, AIDS is far more than a health issue.
It is jeopardizing the advances that these countries have made.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke will be a relative newcomer to the Security Council,
where he is seen only sporadically, and some diplomats wonder if he
will have the patience to live by its peculiar rhythms for a month.
He is a fierce critic of U.N. procedure, accusing the organization
and many of the diplomats assigned to it with being more fascinated
with process than principle.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Monday, he took aim at the organization,
which he said still needed a lot of reform _ words congressional
Republicans always like to hear. He is impatient with the chain of
command and the complex relationships among U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In the last American presidency of the Security Council of the
Clinton era, there will also be some performance diplomacy. Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who is one of the U.N.'s most intractable
critics will be invited to sit in on the Security Council, and the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is chairman, will
hold a hearing in New York, Holbrooke said. Half a dozen senators
and about 30 representatives have already been his guests.
</P>
<P>
   Politically motivated stunts? Well, maybe, a European said. But
if this is what it takes to get a better hearing on Capitol Hill,
then everybody might enjoy a little American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps we didn't do a good enough job on bringing Congress
aboard on policy in the past,'' Holbrooke said in one of several
careful asides hinting that he was not always in line with
administration's handling of foreign issues. He was also asked
Monday why so many war criminals in Bosnia were still at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not share my thoughts with you on why they're at
large,'' he said. ``I find it very, very difficult. I've long taken
the view that they must be brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   At the sort of shabby, '50s-style American mission to the United
Nations, a monument to congressional stinginess toward diplomacy,
Holbrooke has assembled his own team of trusted colleagues from the
past. A tough taskmaster with a gargantuan appetite for work, he
provokes either winces and wounded feelings or a loyalty often
couched in black humor. One of his tops diplomats recalled at his
swearing in that he had worked for Holbrooke ``for 10 years,
between 1994 and 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke plunged into U.N. activity playing from his own
strengths. After checking in at the U.S. mission here only long
enough to claim his new office in August, he left for the Balkans.
There, he is well known. Holbrooke, who was ambassador to Germany
in the early years of the first Clinton administration, later wrote
the 1995 Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia, and then browbeat and
cajoled three distrustful parties - Croats, Serbs and Bosnian
Muslims - into accepting it.
</P>
<P>
   He is also remembered for having secured a celebrated cease-fire
agreement from President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia last October,
only to have it violated, leading to an American-led bombing
campaign this year. Under criticism himself in June in the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee for having negotiated with Milosevic,
an indicted war criminal and recipient of much vitriol from
Washington, Holbrooke was characteristically blunt.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized the limits of his instructions _ the Clinton
administration did not want to commit itself to ground troops to
ensure peace in Kosovo _ and added for good measure that his talks
with Milosevic were hardly fun. ``This isn't bridge or tennis,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Back from the Balkans on Labor Day weekend, he stepped off the
plane into the maelstrom of the crisis in East Timor following the
region's voter for independence. A former assistant secretary of
state for East Asia, Holbrooke was no stranger to the region.
Within hours, he renewed as many contacts as he could muster on a
holiday, from human rights experts to diplomats in the region. Then
he turned his sights on the White House as well as the Security
Council to plead for more of an outcry.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the Indonesians had agreed to international
intervention.

FAMILY HISTORY, TRAPPINGS OF PRO SPORTS CONTRIBUTED TO CARRUTH'S
DOWNFALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The day after gunmen mortally wounded his
pregnant girlfriend, and the police treated him like a suspect, Rae
Carruth took shelter at another girlfriend's apartment here and
spoke in soft tones on the telephone to his stepfather in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth's stepfather, Samuel Carruth, had always been the moral
compass in his life, helping him successfully navigate the
dangerous neighborhood in Sacramento where he had grown up and
where many of his cousins had ended up in jail, friends said. When
Carruth, a wide receiver for the Carolina Panthers, laid down the
telephone, he wept.
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke down into tears,'' Nakish Stewart, the girlfriend,
recalled. ``He said, `I don't believe what's happened to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was only the beginning of Carruth's fall from grace. Last
week, his pregnant girlfriend, Cherica L. Adams, who was 24, died,
a month after she was struck in the chest and neck by four bullets.
Carruth was charged along with three other men with first-degree
murder; the police said he had masterminded the drive-by attack to
avoid responsibility for the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth, who had been free on bond, fled Charlotte and was
captured the following day, hiding in the trunk of a car outside a
motel in western Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' infant son, Chancellor, has defied the odds and survived
after being delivered 10 weeks premature.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional material)
</P>
<P>
   The violent end to Carruth's relationship with Adams surprised
almost everyone who knew them. ``Rae, he's not a conflict guy, if
anything, I think he avoids conflict,'' said Maurice Henriques, a
former college teammate. ``The Rae I know would never be involved
in something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship between Adams and Carruth was never a
story-book love affair. Rather it was a combustible sort of
liaison, not uncommon in professional sports these days, between
young men propelled into sudden fame and fortune and women of
modest means who are intensely attracted not just to them, but to
their stature and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional material)
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Adams and Carruth seemed a good match. Carruth
was a good-looking, millionaire athlete with a spotless record who
liked children and aspired to write screenplays someday. He did not
drink or smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Adams appeared to be a lovely and eloquent young woman pursuing
a career in real estate, who had also started her own
music-production company. ``She was a classy person, real nice, a
smart girl, very ambitious,'' Portia Welch, a friend from high
school, said.
</P>
<P>
   But their lives were much more complicated, friends said.
Plagued by injuries, Carruth, who is 25, was worried about money.
He was nearing the end of his contract with the Panthers and was
saddled with child-support payments for a son he had fathered in
California. His social life was also spinning out of control. He
was seeing at least three women at once, including erotic dancers,
and had befriended some local men with criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   Adams had been dating professional athletes since high school,
her friends said, and traveled frequently to parties and games in
other cities. Last year, she began working as a stripper at The
Diamond Club, a topless bar frequented by professional athletes, a
manager and several employees at the club said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She only quit dancing because she got pregnant,'' said a
dancer at the club, who identified herself as Angel Smith. ``She
really wanted that baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Dancers at The Diamond Club said Carruth had been a regular
there and met Adams while she was dancing about a year ago. But
Adams' mother, Saundra Adams, told The Associated Press that her
daughter met Carruth at a party thrown by another Panther player.
</P>
<P>
   After Adams became pregnant last spring, Carruth urged her to
have an abortion, but she refused because it was against her
principles, her friends said. Still, they say Adams had few
illusions that Carruth would settle down and marry her. She was
aware that he was dating other women.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew where she stood with Rae,'' said one close friend,
who like many of the people interviewed for this article insisted
on anonymity. ``She didn't have any false hopes of getting
married.''
</P>
<P>
   Carruth appeared to become increasingly worried about money as
the pregnancy progressed, Adams' friends said. Though he was a
first-round draft choice out of the University of Colorado in 1997
and led all rookies with 44 receptions, he broke his foot during
the season-opener in 1998, ruining his season. Then this season he
sprained an ankle on Oct. 17 after five games, sidelining him for
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With only one year left on a 4-year, $3.7 million contract, his
financial future was hardly secure. He had lost money in a
nationwide pyramid scheme involving car title loans and was sued by
a couple claiming he had backed out on a house purchase. In
addition, Carruth was paying $5,500 a month to support his child in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Adams complained to friends that Carruth quarreled with her
often about money. ``If she would ask him for something, like for
her bills, he would always get mad,'' Welch said. ``She said it was
always like a money issue with him.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another change in Carruth's life besides the injury.
In early September, he met Stewart, a 23-year-old administrator
with the AAA, at a comedy club. By November, they were going out at
least three times a week and their relationship was deepening,
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   In late October, after attending a Panthers game with the
injured Carruth, Stewart learned through a mutual friend that Adams
was carrying Carruth's baby. She confronted him over dinner that
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `She's telling a lot of people that,''' Stewart
recalled. ``So I asked him, `Rae, are you all going to have a
baby?' You know, I said it with a smile on my face. And he said,
`Well, I don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, after a long argument, Stewart said Carruth
had confided in her that he was not comfortable with his lifestyle
and wanted to settle down with one woman. He led her to believe,
Stewart said, that she was the one.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Adams' friends said, Carruth continued to go
out with Adams regularly and had been telling her that he wanted
her to bear his child.
</P>
<P>
   For a man who made millions playing football, Carruth kept
strange company in Charlotte. He had only one close friend on the
Panthers, Hannibal Navies, a linebacker who had also played with
him at Colorado, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   But there were a few Charlotte men who also came by Carruth's
house often to play pool and hang out, Stewart said. One was
Michael Eugene Kennedy, a 24-year-old street hustler with an arrest
record that included charges of cocaine possession, car theft,
carrying a concealed gun and assault with intent to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Another new friend was William Edward Watkins, a 44-year-old New
Yorker who, prosecutors say, has a record in New York dating to
1983, including charges of assault, larceny and attempted
possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Carruth had met Watkins when he hired him to do
detail work on his Mercedes Benz, and Watkins introduced him to
Kennedy. Kennedy then introduced Carruth to Stanley Abraham, a
19-year-old with no criminal record who had grown up in Kennedy's
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, Watkins and Abraham have all been arrested and accused
of conspiring with Carruth to kill Adams. The police said they were
riding in a rented car from which the shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
   The police declined to say where Carruth was at the time of the
shooting, about 12:20 a.m. on Nov. 16. He had gone to the movies
earlier that night with Adams, the police say. Adams' statements to
the police the night of the attack and Carruth's cell phone records
led investigators to the other three men, who have since made
statements implicating Carruth in the plot.
</P>
<P>
   James Exum, a lawyer for Kennedy, has said Kennedy was driving
the rented car with Watkins and Abraham as passengers, while
Carruth was driving his car in front of Adams' black BMW and
talking with them by cell phone. Carruth slowed down, and Watkins
opened fire on Adams, Exum said.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth has not made a statement to the police, but Stewart said
he told her he was innocent. In several conversations after the
shooting, he told Stewart that he had left the movie theater in his
own car and went his own way. He told her he had not known about
the shooting until several hours later, when Adams' mother,
Saundra, paged him.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth's willingness to let Kennedy and Watkins into his circle
may have stemmed from his upbringing, Stewart said. He grew up in
the tough Oak Park neighborhood of Sacramento, where drugs and
crime were constant threats and some of his friends and relatives
ended up in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth's biological father, a man named Wiggins, abandoned him
when he was born. His legal name is Raelamar Theotis Wiggins, but
he started using the name Carruth when his mother married Samuel
Carruth. He has a sister, Samel.
</P>
<P>
   At Valley High School in Sacramento, Carruth was a poor student,
but his athletic prowess attracted the attention of the football
coach, Dave Haskins. Haskins urged the young man to retake several
classes and boost his grade point average so he could qualify to
play college football. He did.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The coach said Carruth's home life was chaotic. His mother and
stepfather divorced when Carruth was 14. During his high school
years, he bounced around from house to house, living on and off
with various cousins and other relatives, according to Haskins and
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   But Haskins said Carruth did not openly associate with gang
members or troublemakers in high school, and he seemed to distrust
people who might have befriended him solely because of his athletic
ability. ``He didn't trust a lot of people,'' the coach said. ``He
was always evaluating people.''
</P>
<P>
   A good sprinter with soft hands, the 5-foot-11, 195-pound
Carruth was given a scholarship by the University of Colorado in
1992 to play wide receiver. He thrived in Boulder, both on the
field and in class.
</P>
<P>
   Among his teammates, Carruth was known as a fun-loving
prankster. In 1995, he caught 53 passes for 1,008 yards and nine
touchdowns. His senior year, he had 54 catches for 1,116 yards.
</P>
<P>
   He also majored in English and education, maintaining a B
average. ``He didn't go to bars, didn't go to parties, he kept his
nose pretty clean,'' a teammate, Matt Russell, said. ``He was
probably one of the more well-behaved guys in my class.''
</P>
<P>
   But on a visit home in 1994, Carruth had a short affair with a
high school friend, Michelle Wright, who became pregnant and later
gave birth to a boy. In 1997, just as Carruth was entering the
National Football League draft, Wright filed a paternity suit
against him. Carruth fought the suit, but after a blood test proved
he was the father, he settled the case, agreeing to pay her $5,500
a month in child support.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers drafted him in the first round, gave him a $1
million signing bonus and made him a starting wide receiver. But he
had a hard time adjusting to life in North Carolina and missed the
camaraderie of college football. ``Here, I'm kind of alienated from
the guys,'' he once told the Charlotte Observer. ``Once players
leave for the day, they like to do their own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, Carruth seemed to have a special fondness for
children. In Boulder, he befriended a young deaf boy. In Charlotte,
he coached a baseball team and mentored a 6-year-old boy named
Jacobi as part of the Big Brother program.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth told Stewart he wished he had a relationship with his
own son in California, and sometimes felt his desire to help other
children stemmed from guilt over his son. ``He told me `I get
emotional about Jacobi,''' Stewart said. ```I feel like that should
be my son.'''
</P>
<P>
   Known as Cookie to her family because she liked sweets, Adams
graduated from West Charlotte High School in 1993 with high grades
and a reputation as a smart, outgoing and beautiful young woman.
She modeled professionally while still in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone kind of looked up to her,'' recalled Douglas
Blackmon, a high school classmate. ``She was a very pretty girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams had shown a strong interest in professional athletes from
an early age. She babysat for the children of players on the
Charlotte Hornets, and worked as an intern for the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, she went to Winston-Salem State University,
where she studied communications for two years. But she dropped out
in 1995 and began pursuing a career in real estate in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional material)
</P>
<P>
   ``She sold homes to families and made them feel like they were
happy for the opportunity,'' her manager at Torrey Homes, Denis
Ane-McManus, recalled at Adams' funeral on Saturday. ``I used to
tell her she could sell ice to eskimos.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams also continued dabbling in modeling and started her own
company to promote rap musicians and rhythm and blues bands, her
friends said. A statuesque woman, she attracted attention in
Charlotte's nightclubs; she dated athletes from local pro teams and
also had friends on visiting teams, her friends said.
</P>
<P>
   She traveled extensively at the invitation of friends in sports
and the music business. Lakia Quick, a close friend, told the
Charlotte Observer that she had attended an NBA All-Star game in
New York in 1998 with Adams. Shaquille O'Neal stopped to say hello
to her. Adams also dated Larry Johnson of the Knicks when he played
in Charlotte, her friends said. Johnson acknowledged that he knew
Adams, but declined to discuss their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional material)
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in 1998, Adams appears to have run into financial
trouble, friends said. She began working in the boutique at the
Men's Club, a cavernous restaurant with erotic dancers in
Charlotte, according to several club employees. Later last year,
she began dancing herself at The Diamond Club, a seedier topless
bar nearby, employees at the club said.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers at the Diamond Club said Adams met Carruth while she was
dancing there and became infatuated with him. They began dating and
she learned last spring that she was pregnant. She quit dancing and
took a job as a sales representative for a mortgage company.
</P>
<P>
   Several friends said Adams had been ecstatic about having a
baby. Her friends said she loved children and often volunteered to
babysit for their kids for free. Wayne K. Brown, the president of a
local radio station, said Adams had often taken care of his two
sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will miss her radiant smile,'' Brown said at her funeral.
``I have a whole pocketful of pictures of Christmas days when she
visited my kids.''

 By ERIC LIPTON   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ She prefers barbecued ribs to her mother's
homemade lasagna. Her sons wear their Yankees caps backward and
spend afternoons shooting hoops at their local schools. Her aunts,
uncles, bothers, sisters and husband, a Rochester native, all live
in this western New York community, which she considers her
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   But after being repeatedly convicted of shoplifting a total of
less than $500 in goods _ items such as eyedrops, cigarettes and
roll-on deodorant _ Maria Wigent, 37, is being held in a county
jail awaiting deportation next month to Italy, a country where she
has not been since she was 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a drug lord. I'm not a terrorist. I am just a
housewife who got mixed up and made a mistake,'' Mrs. Wigent said.
``How can they just take me away from my country, from my husband
of 16 years, my sons and my friends? This is my country. Italy is
not. It's just where I was born.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wigent's predicament may seem extreme. But it has become so
common in recent years that even sponsors of tough deportation laws
enacted by Congress in 1996 are saying that the law _ or at least
its enforcement _ is now too tough.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Immigration and Naturalization Service
deported 62,359 immigrants with criminal records in the 1999 fiscal
year. That is up 72 percent since Congress expanded the types of
crimes that can result in deportation, including some nonviolent
offenses such as felony shoplifting. The new law also prohibits
those convicted of so-called aggravated felonies from applying for
deportation waivers and it permits people to be deported even if
they committed their crimes decades ago and served their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a just and fair nation and must strike a just and fair
balance in our immigration laws,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum. The
Florida Republican was a co-sponsor of the 1996 legislation, but
has sponsored one of five recently introduced bills that would
amend it.. Added Representative Brian P. Bilbray, a California
Republican who was another co-sponsor of the 1996 legislation: ``We
have a responsibility to go in and do a little tweaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Urged on by Congress, the INS is preparing a new policy on how
to handle deportation cases involving less serious offenses, said
Russell A. Bergeron Jr., a spokesman for the agency, although he
said the agency preferred that Congress revise the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been able to rid American society of some people I
don't think anyone would dispute should be removed from the
country,'' Bergeron said, noting that people convicted of murder
and child abuse have been among those deported. ``But the 1996 act
went too far in some respects.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no solid estimates of how many immigrants convicted of
less-serious crimes like Mrs. Wigent's are being deported each
year, but there is agreement by both supporters and opponents of
the 1996 legislation that the number is at least in the hundreds
annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would never think you would get rearrested for something
that you already paid for,'' said Jose M. Valesquez, a native of
Panama, who served three years' probation after being convicted in
1980 of conspiracy with the intent to distribute narcotics.
Valesquez was detained by the INS after returning from a visit to
his mother in Panama last December, and is free on bond while
awaiting a deprtation hearing. He acknowledges that he used drugs
20 years ago, but says he never sold drugs and has lived a
law-abiding life as a suburban Philadelphia deli owner since. ``You
see this in movies where it happens in other countries, but never
in United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wigent's case has captured widespread attention in
Rochester, a city with a large Italian immigrant community. She,
her four brothers and sisters and parents came to the United States
in 1968. Most of her aunts, uncles and cousins have also left their
native city of Albi behind. Francesco Gaglianese, 68, and Anna
Gaglianese, 58, Mrs. Wigent's parents, still speak Italian in their
modest, two-story home. But the family has integrated into their
adopted community, with her father, who is retired, spending 31
years as a laborer building homes. Her mother was a school
custodian.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wigent, who dropped out of high school, married a
short-order cook from Rochester, Larry Wigent, when she was 21. Two
sons soon followed, Larry Wigent Jr., now 15, and Louis Wigent, 14.
Her husband and two sons are United States citizens. Mrs. Wigent
said she mistakenly believed that by marrying a citizen, she became
one too.
</P>
<P>
   Her trouble began in October 1994, when Mrs. Wigent, who had
been working in a series of fast-food restaurants and clothing
stores, began a shoplifting spree. On 17 occasions, she was
arrested for petty larceny or attempted petty larceny, generally
after being caught with inexpensive items such as cigarettes, court
records say. She pleaded guilty each time, paying small fines. The
convictions made her vulnerable to deportation in 1998, when upon
the advice of a public defender, she said, she pleaded guilty to
her two final larceny charges and a probation violation and was
given a two-year jail sentence. That conviction fell under the 1996
law's definition of an aggravated felony, which applies to a range
a crimes from murder to theft.
</P>
<P>
   A Rochester psychologist diagnosed Mrs. Wigent last month as
suffering from impulse-control disorder, commonly known as
kleptomania, court records show, citing in part marital
difficulties. Mrs. Wigent and her family do not dispute she
deserved punishment for the shoplifting offenses.
</P>
<P>
   But deporting Mrs. Wigent to Italy, they said, is a lifetime
sentence they consider far too extreme. Her family hired a new
lawyer, who asked a Rochester judge to vacate Mrs. Wigent's most
recent convictions, arguing that the public defender had an
obligation to inform her that a guilty plea could result in
deportation. The request was denied last week, and Mrs. Wigent is
scheduled to be deported Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of being sent to Italy _ without the right ever to
return_ terrifies Mrs. Wigent, who cannot read or write Italian In
an interview last week at a county jail in Wyoming, N.Y., she said
she knew of only one relative there, an elderly aunt who lives in a
convent in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like I am in a dream and someone needs to
wake me up,'' said Mrs. Wigent, whose prison-issue blue uniform was
distinguished only by a cross and a charm of St. Barbara that hung
on a necklace, and her gold-and-diamond wedding ring. ``How can
they take my life away from me?''
</P>
<P>
   A petition drive has started in Rochester. A local newspaper
columnist has taken up her cause, writing a column headlined,
``Maria Wigent is no saint, but deporting her does not serve
justice.'' Her lawyer, Jeffrey M. Jayson, is appealing the
Rochester judge's ruling. Her sons are living with her parents,
wondering just what will happen if their mother is sent away for
good. ``I thought she would always be here,'' Louis Wigent said
last week.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Wigent waits for her fate to be decided, others like
her are already back in their native lands. There is Tony El-Dib,
35, of Manhattan, deported to his native Lebanon last month, after
a 1998 bank-fraud conviction related to credit-card abuse. Sergio
A. Sandoval, 38, meanwhile, was dropped off in a border town in
Mexico on Dec. 1. He and his family left their native Mexico in
1964, moving to California. His deportation came after he served a
30-month sentence in Nevada for driving under the influence, his
third alcohol-related driving offense. None resulted in an accident
or injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am only really about 10 minutes away from the border, but it
feels like a million miles,'' said Sandoval, a Marine &UR;  &LR; veteran who
is temporarily living &UR;  &LR; with a minister he met in Nogales, Mexico.
``What am I going to do? Where am I going to go?''
</P>
<P>
   The deportation of Sandoval and hundreds of others like him has
heightened opposition to the 1996 legislation. A woman in Mesquite,
Texas, whose husband served three years in jail after being
convicted of possession of amphetamines in 1989 and who now faces
deportation to Canada, has formed a group called Citizens and
Immigrants for Equal Justice. It started with five families; today
there are about 500 families in 26 states, the Mesquite womam,
Laurie Kozuba, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many families out there that just cannot survive
without some relief coming soon,'' Mrs. Kozuba said.
</P>
<P>
   National organizations, including the American Civil Liberties
Union, the National Immigration Forum and the American Immigration
Lawyers Association, have taken up the cause. Last summer, they
initiated a ``Fix '96'' campaign calling for amendments to the law.
Among other changes, the amendments would allow immigrants
convicted of less serious crimes to apply for deportation waivers.
Current federal law prohibits any special circumstances _ or
consideration of evidence of rehabilitation _ for those convicted
of an aggravated felony.
</P>
<P>
   Five bills are pending in the House or Representatives and two
in the Senate calling for changes in the 1996 immigration law. The
first, introduced in April by Rep. Barney Frank, Democrat of
Massachusetts, has 74 co-sponsors, including six Republicans. It
would allow long-term legal immigrants to seek a waiver to a
deportation order.
</P>
<P>
   Like Frank's bill, McCollum's proposal, introduced in October,
would allow certain people who were deported but not convicted of
serious violent crimes to apply for reentry to the United States.
McCollum developed his plan after he asked Congress to grant
special relief to Robert A. Broley, the son of the former
Republican Party treasurer in Orange County, Fla., who was deported
to Canada last year after he was convicted of felony theft and
fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   These bills, along with two others in the House, have been
referred to a House Judiciary Committee panel headed by Rep. Lamar
Smith, a Texas Republican who was the House sponsor of the 1996
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Smith agrees that the law has, at times, been enforced unfairly.
He helped draft a letter sent last month to Attorney General Janet
Reno, signed by 28 Republicans and Democrats, noting that ``there
has been widespread agreement that some deportations were unfair
and resulted in unjustified hardship.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith is opposed to amending the law, maintaining that the
Department of Justice and the Immigration and Naturalization
Service can address the problem by choosing not to pursue
deportation claims against immigrants convicted of less-serious
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutors across the U.S. make decisions every day about who
they will prosecute,'' Smith said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron, the INS spokesman, said that his agency would much
prefer that Congress modify the law. But the immigration service is
preparing a policy that would establish guidelines for its 33
district offices and other entry points into the United States
detailing what kinds of cases its staff could chose under certain
circumstances not to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are left with no other alternative,'' the agency would
likely put such a policy into effect, Bergeron said, although he
would not offer a starting date.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration advocates also object to merely making an
administrative change, noting that legal immigrants with relatively
minor criminal convictions could never be assured that they would
not suddenly be subject to a deportation proceeding. They would
continue to be at particular risk when they try to reenter the
United States after a visit to another country.
</P>
<P>
   But immigration advocates and families of those facing
deportation are encouraged that the debate has at least started in
Washington. ``It is far from a done deal, but some of the right
ingredients are there,'' said Angela Kelley, deputy director of the
National Immigration Forum. ``There is an unmistakable smell in the
air of the need for change.''

COLUMBINE PARENTS ASK SHERIFF TO RESIGN OVER TAPES OF GUNMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Adding their voices to growing criticism,
parents of students who were shot to death at Columbine High School
called Monday on the Jefferson County sheriff, John Stone, to
resign over the release of videotapes made by the two teen-age
gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud him for saying the buck stops here,'' Darrell Scott,
whose daughter, Rachel, was killed, said on Monday at an informal
new conference by at least five families. ``But Sheriff Stone needs
to take one more step. He has wounded deeply the victims of the
Columbine tragedy over and over, and he needs to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone had apologized for what he conceded was a mistake in
allowing Time magazine and, later, other news organizations to see
the tapes, which had not been shown to families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   But he has refused to resign, saying Time had broken a promise
not to quote anything that the killers said on the tapes. Time has
said no such deal was struck.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Davis, a spokesman for the sheriff, who was elected to a
four-year term 13 months ago, said Stone was out of town on Monday.
Davis said he knew of no plans by the sheriff to resign.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the showing of the tapes has created new tension
throughout the Columbine High area. Families of the victims say
they are still grieving over the massacre last April 20.
</P>
<P>
   The two gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, had planned to
kill hundreds, but after some of their bombs failed to detonate,
they used guns to shoot and kill 12 students and a teacher before
killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In more than two hours of tapes that they made in the weeks
before the killings, the two teen-agers expressed their hatred of
humanity and showed off an arsenal of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the parents said on Monday that Stone, who had
acknowledged that he never watched the tapes, misled them by
promising not to show the tapes to anyone before the families of
victims had an opportunity to view them.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mauser, whose son, Daniel, was killed, said he did not
believe the sheriff's contention that he was misled by Time
magazine and called Stone ``extremely naive or extremely
incompetent.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the tapes and questions over who gets to see them
are not likely to go away. Stone has said that the tapes could be
included in his department's final report on the killings, which is
expected to be made public next month. And families of the students
who were killed or injured might seek the tapes as evidence in
civil lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Others are fighting to limit viewing. Klebold's parents, Thomas
and Susan Klebold, asked a county district court last week to give
custody of the tapes to a judge, complaining that allowing the
sheriff's department to keep them might compromise evidence.
</P>
<P>
   And lawyers for the Jefferson County School District said they
are investigating whether they can block the release of the tapes
to the general public.

BUSH SAYS HE'LL CONFRONT MCCAIN ON THE ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ With his lead in the polls here either
vanishing or gone, Texas Governor George W. Bush said Monday he
will shift his Granite State strategy into a more aggressive mode,
laying out sharp differences with his closest competitor, Senator
John McCain, whom Bush has so far been reluctant to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't started drawing the distinctions yet,'' Bush said in
an interview. ``I intend to do so between January and Election
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the shift is part of an overall intensifying of his
New Hampshire effort, which will see him campaigning for the better
part of 15 days in the state beginning Jan. 5. Bush allies say the
plan has been in the works for at least two weeks, and they insist
it is unrelated to heat the candidate has taken for spending much
less time in New Hampshire than most of his GOP competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he plans to use the added time on the stump here to
build a case on taxes, campaign finance reform, education and
defense spending, that shows he, and not the Arizona senator, has
the answers to move the nation ahead. McCain, he said, has won easy
headlines for a campaign finance plan that would be harmful to
Republican candidates because it does not adequately regulate union
contributions to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that the kind of leadership you want?'' Bush asked. ``I
can't imagine, `Elect me, I'm the kind of leader willing to hurt
the Republican party.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a more pointed approach on the campaign trail,
Bush will begin targeting McCain in his television advertising,
launching a series of ads that ``compare and contrast'' his
positions with McCain's, according to a senior Bush campaign
official.
</P>
<P>
   But while he is cranking up his effort, Bush otherwise showed
little outward concern about his waning support here. Slouched on
the sofa aboard his campaign bus _ the one with the `Live Free or
Die' slogan painted on the side _ and with his black cowboy boots
propped up on a chair, the Texas governor said he expects the tide
to turn when New Hampshire voters get a clearer sense of his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feisty side of me that you haven't seen yet,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Globe poll published Sunday showed McCain leading Bush
by 37 percent to 33 percent, a substantial change from just one
month ago when Bush held a comfortable lead. Though they are
statistically deadlocked _ the gap between the two is less than the
poll's margin of error _ McCain runs even with Bush among
registered Republicans and has a commanding lead among independent
voters who plan to vote in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor acknowledged that he is in a duel for votes
with McCain, but said the rivalry has its benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition in the state has kind of fueled our troops,
given our troops something to fight for,'' he said. ``Just bring
'em on. . . . It's now time to get after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said he expects out-of-state supporters to flood the
Granite State in the final weeks before the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more they hear about how tight a race it is in New
Hampshire, the more friends of mine are saying, `Can I come up and
help?' '' he said. ``Our organization in New Hampshire is getting
geared up for a group of folks, friends, relatives, legislators
from all around the country as we put out the call.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign's plan to devote more time to New Hampshire
and to address McCain head-on, is a turnabout from the tack taken
for much of this year. Bush's own supporters here have criticized
him for months for not spending more time in New Hampshire and for
not using more of his time to take questions from voters much the
way McCain does.
</P>
<P>
   And in his comments about McCain, Bush has tended to speak more
as a friend or defender than a competitor. Typically, when asked
about McCain, Bush would simply repeat that the Arizona senator is
a good man and a friend, someone he has campaigned with and
campaigned for.
</P>
<P>
   It one telling moment, two weeks ago, in the Bedford town hall,
a woman stood to tell the governor that she was torn between him
and McCain. She then asked Bush to tell her something that would
help her make up her mind. Bush fumbled the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm in the finals,'' he joked, then told her that he
refused ``to tear down'' his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, however, Bush was more specific in his criticisms of
McCain. At the same time, he said he would keep his comments
respectful as he attempts to solidify his vote. The governor said
he does not want the Republican primary to begin to resemble the
Democrats' increasingly combative campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like it's getting a little ugly,'' Bush remarked,
referring to the tussling between Vice President Al Gore and former
Senator Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues Bush said he would stress:
</P>
<P>
   --Taxes. McCain will have to answer for his criticism of Bush's
$483 billion tax cut over five years. McCain has said it is too
large. ``We have a difference in taxes and this is going to be an
issue,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   --Education. McCain, Bush said, has not made education a
sufficient priority in his campaign. ``I have an education record
that is a strong education record, not only as a governor of a
state, but I have a plan that will encourage educational excellence
for every child. This is an issue in the campaign,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has proposed funding a school voucher plan by cutting
subsidies for ethanol and other ``special interests.'' Bush has
stressed the need to boost student performance, and has proposed
cutting federal dollars to schools that fail to meet certain
standards.
</P>
<P>
   --Campaign finance. McCain, Bush said, will have to explain why
he walked away from ``a labor loophole'' that allows unions to
spend union members' fees on political campaigns. ``I'm for
campaign funding reform, but I'm not for a plan that hurts the
Republican party and I will make it clear why,'' Bush said. ``That
has not been made clear yet in New Hampshire. I'm going to make it
clear.''

   High Bond Yields Hurt Dow, But Technology Shares Rise
</P>
<P>
   Rising long-term interest rates hurt some segments of the stock
market as concerns mounted about what Federal Reserve policy makers
might do about interest rates at a meeting today. The yield on the
30-year Treasury rose to 6.44 percent from 6.37 percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks seen as sensitive to rising interest rates, like
financial-services companies, helped helped to pull down the Dow
Jones industrial average by 113.16 points, or 1 percent, to
11,144.27. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.94 points,
to 1,418.09, but demand for technology stocks remained intense, and

   Putting a Good Face on Profits

   The punishment that stocks regularly endure when profits come in

going to extremes to paint a rosy picture of their operations.

collection chief for Northern California from 1995 until he was
removed in February 1998, testified at a hearing where he is trying
to get his job back under a federal law that protects
whistle-blowers. The Internal Revenue Service contends that Coons

 McCAIN VOWS TO REPEAL BAN ON NEW ROADS IN WILDERNESS  
 (af)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, N.H. _ Campaigning near New Hampshire's White
Mountain National Forest, Sen. John McCain promised Monday that if
elected president he would repeal President Clinton's recent
executive order banning roads in more than 50 million acres of
pristine wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he came out against the ban, which he said took power
out of local hands, McCain, R-Ariz., painted himself as a Theodore
Roosevelt-style conservationist. He called for new investment in
the country's 379 national parks, including the creation of bonds
backed by park visitation fees. With the white-capped mountains on
the horizon, he portrayed environmentalism as a conservative cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could be more conservative than conserving for ourselves
and our posterity clean air, safe water and the gifts of unspoiled
creation?'' McCain, unveiling his environmental policy proposals,
asked a crowd in a chilly white-walled barn next to a Christmas
tree farm.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has worked to preserve land in Arizona, did not cast
his opposition to Clinton's executive order as criticism of the
goal of protecting the national forest preserve. Rather he objected
to taking the action through an executive order, even though the
president's order set off a rule-making process that includes a
period for public comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that Washington knows best and that local residents
cannot be trusted to do what's right in their own back yard is the
epitome of federal arrogance,'' he said. ``The existence of this
very forest repudiates that offensive notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White Mountain National Forest exists not thanks to
enlightened federal fiat or the presumed superior foresight of the
political class in Washington,'' he said. ``This forest was set
aside nearly a century ago thanks to the vision and energy of local
residents who demanded it. Washington would do well to keep the
example in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   On an issue concerning another crucial primary state, he also
criticized the Clinton administration for extending offshore oil
leases along the California coast over the objections of state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The president's effort to protect forest land, from the White
Mountains to the Sierra Nevada, has drawn praise from
environmentalists who call it one of the century's most ambitious
conservation efforts. But it has also led to opposition from timber
and mining interests and their Republican allies, who have accused
the president of bypassing Congress.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's position allowed him to appeal to those opposed to the
president's action while still calling himself a conservationist.
In a sign of how he was straddling the issue, his campaign handed
out two different news releases on the speech. One geared to New
Hampshire highlighted his promise to overturn the president's
executive order. The other, for a more national audience, put more
emphasis on his support for conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, which has been running advertisements
criticizing Gov. George W. Bush's record on clean air issues,
praised McCain for speaking out about environmental issues. But Dan
Weiss, the environmental group's political director, added that the
senator spoke ``in favor of strong environmental protection while
opposing serious proposals to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also proposed measures to revitalize the nation's system
of national parks. He proposed to create capital development bonds
backed by a part of park visitation fees to refurbish the parks.
Under his plan the secretary of the interior would contract with
private fund-raising groups to issue the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not say how much in park fees he would devote to such
bonds. John Raidt, McCain's policy coordinator, said that a study
by the National Parks Conservation Association, a nonprofit group,
has found that the Grand Canyon could raise $100 million by issuing
bonds backed with a $2 part of its visitors fee. The fee is $20 per
car or $10 per pedestrian for a week's access.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said that $800 million recently awarded to the
federal government from a settlement over disputed Alaska oil lease
revenues should be dedicated to the parks. And he said that the
federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, established in 1964,
should be fully financed up to its $900 million annual
authorization, with half the money going to a state grant program.
</P>
<P>
   McCain asked Republicans and Democrats, environmentalists and
business interests to search for common ground. ``Just as
politicians or industry squander credibility when we indifferently
brush aside genuine environmental threats,'' he said, ``some
environmentalists risk becoming irrelevant when they eagerly
denounce even the most necessary reforms of failed policies as evil
conspiracies to gut environmental law.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech was one in a series of policy addresses. As with
his health care address last week, there was some confusion about
the extent of his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that ``twice during his administration, Clinton has
invoked executive authority to unilaterally determine the future of
millions of acres of federal land across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   News releases handed out by the campaign said he would repeal
two executive orders issued by Clinton, apparently referring both
to the president's action on forests and his announcement at the
Grand Canyon during the 1996 presidential campaign that he was
making two million acres of the red rock country of Utah into a
national monument.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain spoke of the repeal of only one executive action. He
said later in an interview that he was not pledging to overturn the
Utah designation, even though he called it a ``blatant political
stunt.''

REFUSING NO-AD IDEA PUTS BRADLEY ON THE DEFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (A Political Memo) 
(ms) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a certain level, it sounded like an act of unalloyed civic
virtue: have the two Democratic presidential candidates swear off
all campaign commercials, and in their place stage face-to-face
debates throughout the primary season. As Vice President Al Gore
explained on ``Meet the Press'' to his rival, Bill Bradley, the
offer was meant to satisfy Bradley's oft-stated appeal to get
so-called soft money out of the political process and, in Gore's
words, ``accomplish one of the best reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprising overture on Sunday morning television not only
seemed to momentarily unsettle Bradley _ ``He looked like a Rhodes
scholar caught in the headlights,'' said Alex Castellanos, a
Republican media consultant _ but it also incited one of the most
dramatic exchanges of the campaign, one that revealed the growing
intensity _ even the palpable antipathy _ between them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no matter how public-spirited Gore's gesture might have
appeared, it had little to offer a contender like Bradley, whose
only means of competing effectively is to spread his message
through paid political advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 30 to 40 percent of the people in the country don't know
who you are,'' Bradley said Monday as he campaigned in Iowa, ``not
using the television to communicate with them seems to me to be a
little bit contrary to our interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley acknowledged that in states like Iowa and New Hampshire,
which hold the first two presidential primaries, he can deliver his
message ``by looking at people in the eye in town hall meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you get to a national forum,'' he added ``the only
way you can do that is doing the same thing, looking at people in
the television, in their living rooms, telling them what you
believe, where you want to take the country, who you are and why
you believe what you believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Gore campaign has identified a soft spot in
Bradley's firm embracmpaign finance reform. That Bradley has
been compelled to defend his reliance on television advertisements
undermines his condemnations of the money raised by other,
better-financed candidates like Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly they dreamed that up as a response to the
Bradley-McCain event of last week,'' observed David Gergen, a
former White House communications adviser in both Democratic and
Republican administrations. He was referring to Bradley's
appearance in New Hampshire last Thursday with a Republican
presidential candidate, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, in which they
pledged to ban soft money from their campaigns if they won their
parties' nominations. But Bradley added that he would only
participate if the eventual Republican nominee also agreed to
eschew soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore seized on this point Monday, suggesting that
Bradley was an advocate of reform in name only. ``Senator Bradley
has talked about campaign finance reform,'' said Chris Lehane, a
Gore campaign spokesman. ``But if you're going to talk the talk,
you better be able to walk the walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane added that it was unclear which of the Democrats would
benefit most from a moratorium on commercials. But he said, ``My
guess is most people would agree that the Lincoln-Douglas debate
model would be better than the current 30-second TV commercials and
9-second sound bites.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, however, said that voters would interpret Gore's gambit
as strategy more than sincerity. ``What it says is that this is
another example of some tactic, as opposed to just saying what he
believes,'' he said. ``I mean, process tactics are not what the
people I think care about. What they care about is substance and
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The former senator from New Jersey has tried in recent weeks to
reinforce this idea in the commercials he has been running in New
Hampshire and Iowa. The advertisements include issue-oriented
pieces concerning Bradley's views on health care and campaign
finance reform, and testimonials featuring former Senate colleagues
like Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's offer was the dominant theme in the coverage of the
``Meet the Press'' debate, which drew a larger audience than usual
for the Sunday morning show.
</P>
<P>
   The morning-after analysis in print and online seemed to side
largely with Bradley: in USA Today, for instance, the columnist
Walter Shapiro dismissed Gore's action as ``a transparent
gimmick.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, tactical strikes are a mainstay of television debates.
Gergen, now a professor of public service at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government, said that although Gore's move was
transparent, it had political appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a smart tactical ploy, but it was a ploy,'' he said.
``Gore is the front-runner; of course he wants to find ways to
muffle Bradley's voice. And advertising is going to be crucial to
Bradley's closing the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stevens, who produces McCain's political commercials,
thinks that in the end, the issue doesn't resonate with anyone but
the ``insiders and activists who watch all that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a debate in a classroom with 30 good government
students,'' he said, ``they would probably agree that there
shouldn't be any paid advertising. But (a) that's not going to
happen, and (b) I don't think it's anything that the average voter
thinks about at all.''

standoff last week in Louisiana were flown back to Cuba Monday over
the protests of state prosecutors who say the men should have been
put on trial for kidnapping, Clinton administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh remained in the United States as federal officials
investigated accusations that he had raped a female prisoner taken
hostage in the standoff at the Louisiana jail. He also has not
completed sentences for two recent convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The other Cuban inmates were taken in heavily guarded
Immigration and Naturalization Service vans to an airport in
Alexandria, La., and placed aboard a government jet for the flight
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   While the agreement drew criticism from Louisiana authorities as
inviting similar situations at other prisons, Clinton
administration officials insisted that the unusual accord with the
government of Fidel Castro allowing the men to be returned to Cuba
after they freed the hostages did not represent a significant
advance in Cuban-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, they said, was there any tie between this agreement and any
possible settlement of another immigration case, that of a
6-year-old Cuban boy who was rescued from the Atlantic Ocean off
Florida last month and who has become the subject of an highly
publicized international child-custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Castro government has demanded the return of the boy, Elian
Gonzalez, whose mother and step-father drowned in their effort to
reach the United States in a crowded boat.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service has recently sent signals that it
intends to send Elian home to his father in Cuba over the
objections of his Cuban-American relatives and of powerful
Cuban-American political leaders in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   James Foley, a state department spokesman, was asked at a news
conference Monday if there was any link between the two cases.
``Absolutely not,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Cuban inmates deported Monday were ``being returned
to Cuba at their request, and the government of Cuba has agreed to
accept them. We believe this resolution is in the best interests of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Other administration officials said they believed that Castro
had agreed to accept the inmates back in Cuba partly in hope of
improving his image with the American public. ``He can say he's the
man who prevented this hostage drama from turning into a tragedy,''
said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban inmates involved in the hostage standoff last week had
completed prison sentences for crimes committed in the United
States but were being held indefinitely because their deportation _
the usual procedure for felons who are not American citizens _ had
been blocked by the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   All had arrived here in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, during which
Castro sent thousands of criminals to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached on Saturday allowing the seven inmates to
return to Cuba outraged prosecutors in St. Martin Parish, where the
prison is.
</P>
<P>
   J. Phil Haney, the first assistant district attorney for the
parish, called the agreement an unwelcome surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not seen fit to talk to us about this,'' he said of
the Clinton administration. ``We still haven't been officially
notified that anyone is going to Cuba, even though we made known
our wishes to prosecute and maintain custody of the people
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the siege, he said, the seven Cubans should have
been tried in Louisiana on charges of aggravated kidnapping, which
carries a mandatory life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Haney said he was particularly angry at the thought that the
prisoner who remained behind, Roberto Villar-Gana, might eventually
go free in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the rape accusation, Villar-Gana was recently
convicted in Cameron, La., of the attempted murder of a police
officer and of distributing cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made it clear to INS that Villar was not a Cuban
detainee in the sense that all of the others were,'' Haney said,
using the initials for the immigration service. ``We were assured
by the INS that he would not be handled like the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they had little information about the
rape accusations against Villar-Gana, whose mother acted as an
intermediary between the hostages-takers and the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Several hostages taken by the Cubans were female inmates, and
federal officials said one had accused Villar-Gana of sexually
assaulting her. ``Obviously, we have to investigate the rape
charges before we even consider sending him back,'' an official
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Villar-Gana's mother, Mercedes Villar, who first
disclosed the deal between the United States and Cuba last weekend.
She told reporters that she had seen a written agreement
guaranteeing safe passage for her son and the other inmates to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Haney of the prosecutor's office said that he welcomed the
release of the hostages taken during the six-day standoff but that
it was wrong for the government to promise the hostage-takers free
passage out of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's ever a circumstance where you want to
make this kind of offer as part of negotiation, especially when
they've taken hostages in a penal institution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It subjects every penal institution in the United States to
the situation where, if you bargain with someone, you know you'll
get what you're asking for,'' he continued. ``It just invites these
situations to take place.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 10 minutes with Robert F. Greenhill, a longtime Wall
Street dealmaker, it is clear why the Justice Department hired him
to advise it on its negotiations with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Ask about his 20-year friendship with Sanford I. Weill, chairman
of Citigroup and frequent dinner companion, and his answer is a
firm ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Question his role in some of this decade's largest corporate
takeovers, like Viacom's bid for Paramount Communications or the
restructuring of IBM, and he says, ``I won't talk about that.''
When queried about what it was like to run not one, but two, Wall
Street firms, he dodges the question: ``You don't really want to
know, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   After 37 years on Wall Street, Greenhill has joined the rarefied
group of investment bankers who command the ear of America's
corporate elite. Not only does he have a knack for wooing the most
stubborn executives, but he has the drive to get them to the
bargaining table. Still, while he delights in his role as
matchmaker, he prefers to negotiate far from the eyes of a curious
press and public. So it comes as no surprise to those who know him
that the Justice Department sought his discretion in studying the
financial impact of various proposals to resolve the antitrust case
against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, not many people on Wall Street have the stature to give
counsel on the most important antitrust action in recent history.
Joel Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division,
needs help sifting through the technological and financial
implications of each proposal.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft is fractured into pieces, Klein wants a name-brand
executive to defend that decision before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But of the handful of eligible candidates Klein approached, who
would be willing to do it?
</P>
<P>
   Almost every leading investment bank with any technology prowess
has either worked with Microsoft or does not want to risk making
such a powerful enemy. Smaller boutiques could not afford the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever comes forward has to be credible,'' said Charles Koob,
an antitrust attorney at Simpson Thacher &AMP; Bartlett in New York.
``Greenhill is credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenhill, who now owns a small investment firm, was attracted
to the Microsoft assignment, in part, because it was an unusual
challenge. That is in keeping with his driven personality.
Greenhill's recent interest in technology companies comes at an
age, 63, when most executives are considering retirement. When he's
not piloting one of his three airplanes, including a
top-of-the-line jet, between homes in Greenwich, Conn., Maine and
Nantucket, Mass., he can be found on his satellite phone with
clients. (His wife pilots her own single-engine plane.) He took up
golf in his late 50s and now boasts a solid 14 handicap. On
vacation, he pushes the limits, too, taking his family canoeing
near the Arctic Circle or skiing in untainted wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   But his true passion is negotiating deals. Sumner Redstone,
Viacom's chairman, knows that firsthand. In the spring of 1993,
Greenhill called Redstone and suggested that they and Martin Davis,
then Paramount's chairman, have dinner. Greenhill knew Redstone
coveted Paramount's assets but after three years of trying had
failed to strike a pact with Davis. Greenhill knew Davis well
because he had advised on Paramount's unsuccessful $12 billion
hostile bid for Time Inc. in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `If you are asking what I think you are, it's not
going to happen,''' Redstone said in a recent interview. ``I didn't
want to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two chairmen agreed to meet and, as Redstone
predicted, the ensuing months' negotiations were tortuous. More
than once Greenhill dragged Redstone to the bargaining table
against his will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob was absolutely persistent,'' Redstone said. ``A couple of
times I said, `Leave it alone. It's not going to happen.' I even
sent a telegram that said, `Bob, back off.''' But he never did
until the deal was done.

UNDATED: was done.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Such forcefulness engenders enemies too. Wall Street executives
are loath to criticize Greenhill publicly, but privately warn that
he can wreak havoc. When he left Morgan Stanley in 1993 to become
chairman of Smith Barney Shearson, as it was then named, he
relentlessly pursued talented financiers at Morgan, angering old
colleagues. His abrupt manner has bruised more than a few egos. His
zeal to win at any cost offends even his most avid supporters. ``He
can be like a bull in a china shop,'' said one banker who worked
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhill attended Yale University, graduating in 1958. At first
he thought of majoring in physics, then philosophy and finally,
painting. His senior thesis, he said, was on Van Gogh's theory of
color. In perhaps his first ``hostile takeover,'' he met his wife,
Gayle, when she was on a blind date with his college roommate.
</P>
<P>
   After two years in the Navy, he abandoned his paint brushes and
headed for Harvard Business School. In 1962, MBA in hand, he moved
to New York and joined Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, his career was blessed. In 1970 he became a
partner and set to work creating a mergers and acquisitions
department that would become a powerhouse. He later ran investment
banking and, in 1989, was made a vice chairman. Two years later he
was named president.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenhill's intensity was not suited for the corner office.
In March 1993, after a weekend retreat in Utah with clients,
Greenhill was ousted as president. He left the firm soon after,
ending a 31-year career, and found refuge with his good friend
Weill, who named him chairman of Smith Barney Shearson, then part
of Travelers Corp.. That job lasted only three years before
Greenhill _ pocketing tens of millions of dollars in the process _
was again asked to step down, former colleagues said, in a
management tussle over how the firm was being run. In 1996, he
started the boutique Greenhill &AMP; Co..
</P>
<P>
   Greenhill is hard pressed to reflect on his undistinguished
career as a manager. But former colleagues say he lacks an innate
ability to lead. When asked about it, he becomes unusually still,
his hearty laugh silenced. ``One of the pleasures of being in a
small firm is you can focus on working with clients,'' he said,
noting that he has only six partners now. ``Helping clients is the
thing I've liked doing all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenhill got a call from Klein the week before Thanksgiving
asking if he was interested in the Microsoft assignment. Executives
from Greenhill &AMP; Co. then met with Justice Department officials to
understand exactly what was expected. They were told, said an
executive involved in those discussions, that it would be Greenhill
&AMP; Co.'s job to analyze the financial impact if Microsoft were ever
split up.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhill has a limited background in technology, although he
advised IBM on its restructuring in 1993 and includes Compaq
Computer in his stable of clients. ``He doesn't necessarily
understand all the technology he is dealing with,'' said one banker
who has worked with him.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhill, too, wanted a well-defined role, which he accepted on
Nov. 28. He will not say what his firm is being paid by the Justice
Department, but industry executives say it is a flat fee that is
``substantially less'' than the millions his firm usually commands.
So far he has assigned six bankers to the task.
</P>
<P>
   One is Jeffrey Williams, a long-time colleague of Greenhill's
who once headed Morgan Stanley's telecommunications and media group
and counseled AT&AMP;T. Colleagues describe Williams, a former
architect, as technologically savvy and detail-oriented, a perfect
foil to Greenhill, whose strength is distilling mountains of
research by subordinates into a coherent action plan.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhill is not shy about worming his way into the action.
Michael Levitt, a partner at the leveraged buyout firm Hicks, Muse,
Tate &AMP; Furst and a close friend who worked for Greenhill at Morgan
Stanley and later Smith Barney, recalled the summer of 1997 when
Hicks, Muse announced it was buying Lin Television for $1.4
billion. A banker from Morgan Stanley had brought Levitt the idea,
which Greenhill later asked about. ``He didn't call up and say
`What role can we play?''' Levitt said. ``He called up and said he
wanted to understand the broadcasting industry and why we were
interested in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few bankers can get much mileage from a phone call like that.
But Greenhill called Levitt later and said Hicks, Muse should line
up a partner, like NBC, in case another bidder emerged. Levitt
agreed. So Greenhill called his Nantucket neighbor, Jack Welch, the
chief executive of General Electric, which owns NBC, and set up a
lunch at his summer home there for Robert Wright, NBC's chief
executive, as well as executives for Hicks, Muse.
</P>
<P>
   It was timely. Raycom Media, an Alabama-based company, offered
to pay $1.7 billion for Lin. The lunch meeting at Greenhill's led
to a partnership between Hicks, Muse and NBC that topped Raycom
with its own $1.9 billion offer. ``That was Bob using his network
of relationships to create opportunities for both of us,'' Levitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   He is doing the same thing for his firm by advising the Justice
Department. Greenhill &AMP; Co. is increasingly interested in
representing Internet companies, having helped counsel Compaq this
year on the sale of its 83 percent stake in Alta Vista, a Web
search engine, to CMGI, a publicly-traded company that invests in
Internet ventures. His involvement in the Microsoft assignment
suggests that Greenhill doesn't want to lose his edge in the new
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob wants to make sure the world knows he's not out of the
game,'' said one executive who has worked with him. But don't ask
about it; his answer is predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll play golf with you,'' Greenhill said, laughing. ``But I
won't talk about Microsoft.'' &QL;

REELING KINGS NEED A QUICK START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 30 games everything seemed fine. The Kings might not have
been as good as their 39 points in the standings, but they had
played through injuries and certainly looked capable of a good seed
in April when the playoffs begin.
</P>
<P>
   Three grotesque losses later, the Kings don't know who they are.
Thirteen of the 23 goals they allowed came in the first period and
disintegrated their confidence. They started getting their stars
back and it only made them play worse.
</P>
<P>
   There is no magic wand for turning this around, but a good first
period Wednesday night at San Jose certainly would help.
</P>
<P>
   It would help the team breathe for the first time since losing
7-1 a week ago in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rangers beat them 8-3 the next night, the Kings' spirit
was broken by a couple of early saves from goaltender Mike Richter.
At the same time New York was walking in on Jamie Storr.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third period of last Saturday's 8-4 loss to
Chicago, Rob Blake landed a crushing check on Jean Pierre Dumont.
The Blackhawks responded by hitting Ziggy Palffy, but Sean
O'Donnell whacked Alexei Zhamnov.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared, but it was two periods too late. The score was
5-1 Chicago. The game was over. The message was wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Although top players were returning, even the best need a few
games to get all the way back. Young defenseman Aki Berg played
maybe his best two games as a King when Blake was out. When Blake
returned, Berg wilted.
</P>
<P>
   Fragile? Extremely.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings virtually have no postseason experience to get them
through the tough spots. That includes coach Andy Murray, who is in
his first season and captain Blake, who has played four playoff
games since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kings acquired Palffy and Bryan Smolinski last summer
from the New York Islanders, they got two top offensive players.
They also got two guys who hadn't been in a playoff game in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   When you're trying to find your legs for the long season ahead,
that isn't a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey is a two-way sport and the offense has abandoned the
defense. The Kings' early-season success was based in part on the
forwards getting back to help out. But Wednesday night, while
Palffy and Luc Robitaille were hanging out at the red line, the
defense was getting battered in the Kings' end.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of response got winger Donald Audette bumped to the
fourth line and wondering how he became the scapegoat for this
mess. It had nothing to do with what he did with the puck. It's
what he did when he didn't have it that helped caus the freefall.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the team was among the top teams in the Western
Conference, Murray was obsessing about the standings. He has given
the team structure that was needed for the post-Larry Robinson era,
but the next game was not the biggest game. If you doubt that, look
at the Ducks, who are tied with the Kings and Dallas Stars in the
Pacific Division after beating mighty Detroit 3-1 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed the Kings by 10 points just two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jozef Stumpel, who has missed six weeks after undergoing
abdominal surgery, could be back Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that two points here or two points there could decide
whether the team finishes fifth in the conference or eighth or out
of the playoffs all together.
</P>
<P>
   But one confident first period could mean a lot more in deciding
a season.
</P>
<P>
   What's up? Anyone who expects a lot from Stumpel right away
might want to know that Colorado's Peter Forsberg has produced one
assist and is a minus-4 in the six games since that five-point
performance against Calgary in last month's season debut.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old star missed all of training camp and the
Avalanche's first 23 games while recovering from offseason shoulder
surgery, and he had predicted there would be some hard times for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly doesn't help that captain Joe Sakic remains out
with what the team is calling a rib cartilage injury. He has been
skating for brief periods on his own, but never when anyone is
around.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic, stuck at 999 NHL points, missed his 11th consecutive game
Monday. He came back Nov. 23 against the Kings and scored a goal
but last played three days later and isn't expected back until
after Christmas. &QL;

GENDERGAP (Phoenix) _ Sen. John McCain's call to arms for political
reform has rallied men to his cause, but the very intensity that is
making his campaign effective in New Hampshire may also have a
downside with Republican women, polls show. So far, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush is attracting female GOP voters by a significant
margin. Poll results comparing the preferences of men and women in
early primary states show that, although many women respect McCain,
they express a clear preference for Bush. Aware of this gender gap,
McCain is turning increasingly in his policy addresses to domestic
issues that are of concern to both sexes but traditionally of more
interest to women, including education, the environment and Social
Security _ all issues Bush has been speaking to for months. By KRIS
MAYES. Story will move in the ``A'' category.

   BOMB (Phoenix) _ Explosives similar to those stolen last week
from a quarry near Drake are stored at scores of mines around
Arizona, state officials said Monday, and they're often unguarded
in isolated areas. In fact, neither the state mine inspector nor
the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms know the
quantity and type of explosives stored by the 87 Arizona mines that
use them. State officials, who say they are ``on pins and needles''
in the wake of the theft, said that all they know for sure is there
are plenty of explosives out there. Last week, thieves stole 750
pounds of fuel oil mixed with ammonium nitrate _ a fertilizer _, as
well as 250 pounds of dynamite from a relatively small flagstone
quarry owned by 3 Wins Mining Co. south of Ash Fork. By KERRY
FEHR-SNYDER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

DRIVE-IN-NATIVITY-2 -- A spectator viewing the drive-through,

DRIVE-IN-NATIVITY-1 -- Two camels, Bill and Eli, tied up in front
of the Christian Tabernacle Church in Southington. A few feet away,
spectators in hundreds of cars await a four-minute glimpse of the

among the latest, and oddest, wrinkles in late-20th-century
Christmas revelry: the drive-through, live-action Nativity scene.

frenetic moment in the pivotal party scene at Gatsby's mansion in
John Harbison's opera of ``The Great Gatsy,'' which opened Monday
night at the Metropolitan Opera House. Giving voice to F. Scott
Fitzgerald's novel of wealth and reckless yearning presents

Robert Greenhill, a longtime Wall Street deal-maker, was hired by
the Justice Department to advise it on its negotiations with
Microsoft. After 37 years on Wall Street, Greenhill has joined the

KINGS LOOK FOR A LIFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Kings survived injuries to Luc Robitaille,
Ziggy Palffy and Stephane Fiset, so coach Andy Murray won't say the
return of first-line Jozef Stumpel will ignite the sputtering club.
</P>
<P>
   But after allowing 23 goals in a three embarrassing losses,
there's a reason the Kings are excited about Stumpel's expected
return Wednesday at San Jose. The Kings need rejuvenation, and
Stumpel can provide a jolt.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel's return means the reuniting of the Kings' top line _
Stumpel flanked by Palffy and Robitaille. It also means the rest of
the lines can get back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handles the puck really well and he's going to create that
much more room for us,'' Robitaille said. ``Sure, we need him. A
guy like that, he's talented. We need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray has a few reasons for downplaying Stumpel's return.
Murray wants to take pressure off the 23-year-old, and Stumpel
isn't in game condition. In addition, Robitaille is trying to find
his pre-broken-foot form and Palffy is fighting back problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone over how we want him to play that first game
back,'' Murray said. ``We have to get him in sometime. We know it's
a big game and we're putting a guy in that hasn't played in a long
time, but we have to get him in. He's got to play hard, but he's
got play a basic game and play strong defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings add toughness: As expected, the Kings added tough forward
Bill Huard to their 23-man roster _ and it comes with a message.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were pushed around in Saturday's 8-4 loss to Chicago.
Tough guy Steve McKenna was a coach's decision scratch and the
addition of Huard, who may not play during this promotion, is to
give the Kings some toughness in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Huard had 63 minutes in penalties in 11 games for Lowell (Mass.)
of the AHL and was impressive in a Monday night fight.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also made a few other expected moves because of the
quasi-roster freeze. Jason Blake and Garry Galley, both suffering
post-concussion syndrome, were put on injured reserve. Defenseman
Jere Karalahti and winger Dan Bylsma, demoted to Long Beach on
Sunday morning, both practiced Monday with the Kings. One of those
players can be sent back to Long Beach to make room for Stumpel.

IMPRISONED SCIENTIST SUES U.S. AGENCIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wen Ho Lee, a nuclear weapons scientist who has
been the subject of a complex investigation into possible espionage
by China, filed a lawsuit on Monday against the FBI and the Justice
and Energy Departments, saying they engaged in a campaign of news
leaks that violated his privacy and wrongfully portrayed him as a
spy.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court here, accuses the
three government agencies of violating the Privacy Act and
selectively leaking ``misleading information designed to convince
the public that Lee had engaged in espionage activities for the
People's Republic of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been at the center of a government investigation into
whether and how the Chinese may have made a leap in nuclear weapons
technology with information stolen from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was indicted this month by a federal grand jury in New
Mexico on 59 counts of illegally removing highly classified design,
construction and testing data from the Los Alamos weapons
laboratory where he was employed. The indictment charged that Lee
had violated the Atomic Energy Act and Foreign Espionage Act by
assembling collections of computer files that contained some of the
country's most closely held nuclear weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Although the indictment accused Lee of a serious breach of
security, including charges that could send him to prison for life,
it did not accuse him of spying or of turning any secrets over to a
foreign government.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that accompanied the civil lawsuit filed on
Monday, Lee's son and daughter said that they were ``particularly
concerned that the unlawful leaks engaged in by the defendants are
continuing and will potentially have prejudicial impact on Dr.
Lee's ability to defend himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed on behalf of Lee and his wife, Sylvia Lee,
does not seek any specific monetary damages. But it provides a
forum for the Lee family to press the argument that the indictment
is an effort by the government to save face and find something with
which to charge Lee after officials failed to find evidence of the
espionage they were investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also contends that the leaks were intended to divert
attention away from the fact that the government had sloppy
security procedures in its national laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the energy secretary, told reporters on Monday
at the Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque that he believed
``the lawsuit has no foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a concerted effort to protect the privacy of all
individuals in this case,'' Richardson said. ``I believe we have
acted responsibly and been very deliberate _ especially the Justice
Department, in the law enforcement effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI declined to comment, and Justice Department officials
said they would review the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit cited several news accounts as evidence of government
leaks, particularly an article that appeared in The New York Times
on March 6, 1999. The Times article included specific details
which, the suit asserted, could have come only from the files and
records of the FBI and the Justice and Energy Departments.
</P>
<P>
   Among those issues, attributed to ``officials,'' were the
employment history of the Lees, the results of a polygraph
examination of Lee and information about personal financial
transactions by Lee. Lawyers for Dr. and Mrs. Lee assert that such
disclosures violate the Privacy Act even if they are true.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims that after the publication of the Times
article, the Lees ``were forced to undergo severe harassment,
threats and 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week FBI surveillance.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also cited other news reports, including one in The
Wall Street Journal that attributed information to ``a senior
law-enforcement official'' and another in The Los Angeles Times
that relied on a ``U.S. official familiar with the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The government began its investigation of Lee in connection with
what officials believed was China's apparent theft of secret data
related to the W-88 warhead, which was designed at Los Alamos. Lee
was fired in March for security violations that were uncovered in
connection with that investigation. After he was fired, government
investigators said they discovered that he had been transferring
and copying vast amounts of information. The suit on Monday
challenges the government's actions in the first investigation,
which did not result in any charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the indictment, prosecutors said Lee had transferred secret
information from a classified computer network at Los Alamos into
an unsecure system, then copied much of the information onto
portable, high-volume computer tapes, some of which are missing.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the files included thousands of pages of
documents related to the design, construction and testing of
America's nuclear weapons arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is being held without bail, and his family also expressed
concern in a statement on Monday that he would not be able to make
collect calls to his family and that ``any meetings with his
counsel or family members must be conducted in the English language
and in the presence of an FBI agent.''

MARKET PLACE: MONSANTO, PHARMACIA STOCKS PLUNGE ON NEWS OF DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Graphic previously skedded with this story has been
eliminated.) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day after Monsanto Co. and Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn announced a $27
billion merger to create a global pharmaceutical company, their
stocks plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were apparently disappointed that neither company was
taken over by a much bigger company at a rich premium, and were
concerned that the combined company could be dragged down by
Monsanto's agriculture division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the market was looking for an outright takeover of one
of the companies,'' said William Fiala, an analyst at Edward Jones
Inc. in St. Louis. ``But also, Wall Street doesn't like
uncertainty, and right now the ag business is blanketed with
uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Monsanto's agriculture division has been considered a
liability, depressing the company's stock for months. When the
company talked merger, it was Searle, its pharmaceutical unit and
creator of the the blockbuster arthritis drug Celebrex, that
garnered more interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone today is looking at the albatross that is this
agriculture division,'' said Sano Shimoda, an analyst at Bioscience
Securities in Orinda, Calif. ``But I think they had to do a deal
and this was the only deal they could do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Monsanto's only option, stock analysts said Monday,
because no one wanted the agriculture unit, despite its
best-selling herbicide, Roundup, and its pioneering development of
bio-engineered crops.
</P>
<P>
   The merger suggests a reversal for Monsanto, which less than
five years ago embarked on an ambitious plan to transform itself
from a stodgy chemical maker into a life sciences company that
would use biotechnology to create a ``brave new world'' of
sustainable agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   To speed its drive, the company spent more than $8 billion in
just under two years to acquire some of the world's largest seed
companies. Its plan was to use the new science of genomics to
manipulate the genes of plants to create corn that could ward off
pests because of an inbred pesticide, and soybeans that could
withstand chemical spraying to kill weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 70 million acres were planted with genetically engineered
crops in 1999, an indication of the company's success in marketing
to farmers. But the very strategy that has propelled the biotech
revolution on the farm continues to drag down a company that some
in Europe have labeled a producer of ``Frankenstein Foods.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Monsanto and Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn have agreed to merge,
the time has come to decide what will happen to one of the world's
biggest agricultural chemical and seed companies _ a pioneer in the
development of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   The executives who will lead the combined company say they will
create an agricultural subsidiary and then sell about 20 percent of
it in an initial public offering of stock sometime next year, a
move that will generate cash to help the company reduce its nearly
$6 billion in debt. The move, they say, will allow investors to
choose between the drug and agriculture divisions.
</P>
<P>
   In talking about the combination, though, executives have
focused not on the agriculture unit but on the advantages of
combining Pharmacia and Monsanto's Searle unit, which together
would have one of the industry's biggest sales forces.
</P>
<P>
   The agriculture division remains, at least among some of
Monsanto's top executives, a possible sleeper, an out-of-favor
business that is too important to dump but too much of a liability
to keep in whole, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe the valuation for the ag side is at the bottom,''
said James Wilbur, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ``A year
from now it could be robust, so why not keep it?''
</P>
<P>
   Because of how the merger will be accounted for, the combined
company cannot sell the entire unit immediately anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Monsanto executives have consistently outlined the growth
potential of plant biotechnology, with huge expected gains once the
company broadens its pipeline and starts genetically altering crops
to produce more nutritious foods.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent billions of dollars to develop genetically
engineered crops, Monsanto has lobbied for worldwide approval, so
that the company can sell to farmers everywhere and so that foreign
markets will be receptive to the exported biotech crops of U.S.
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, though, Monsanto has suffered from a vicious backlash
against genetically modified foods, and a movement against the
products has begun to take hold this year among Americans as well.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto executives say that the products have been proved safe
and that once the storm clouds clear, Monsanto stands to gain the
most because it is the world's second-largest seed company and the
developer or licensee of more than 90 percent of the genetically
modified crops now on the market.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, just 2.8 million acres worldwide were planted with
biotech seeds; in 1999, an estimated 70 million acres were planted.
And Roundup, the company's best-selling herbicide, has been a cash
cow for nearly 20 years, racking up more than $2 billion in sales
in 1998, and effectively crippling its competitors in the
agricultural-chemicals market because of its compatibility with
many biotech seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have decided not to stick around. On Monday,
shares of Monsanto dropped $5.125, to $36.625. The stock is down
22.9 percent in the past year; and shares of Pharmacia fell $3.125,
to $47.125.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The problem may be, as Wilbur outlined, simply a question of
uncertainty. After moving swiftly to create, market and license its
biotechnology products, and acquire some of the world's largest
seed companies, Monsanto has stumbled repeatedly in its effort to
integrate its units and persuade the public of the feasibility of
what it has called the new agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto and other big seed companies have been embroiled in a
series of lawsuits over patent infringement. Farmers have
complained about Monsanto's aggressive tactics, which included
hiring detectives, to enforce its contracts. There have also been
growing concerns about the safety of genetically modified seeds,
which have been approved for use in the U.S. but are still little
understood by the public.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto is also facing legal challenges because of its
dominance in the seed market. Just last week, a group of leading
anti-trust lawyers filed a class-action lawsuit against Monsanto,
saying the company rushed its biotech products to market without
proper testing. The suit, backed by some environmental activists,
also charged the company with masterminding an international cartel
that sought to fix prices in the corn and soybean markets.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto executives said the lawsuit has no merit and called it,
in effect, political grandstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawyers say they are preparing a separate suit
in the cotton market. And the Justice Department says it has
broadened an investigation into Monsanto's proposed acquisition of
Delta &AMP; Pine Land, the world's biggest cotton seed company, to
include ``related matters'' in the cotton seed market. Among other
things, Monsanto says the Justice Department has asked the company
for information about its licensing agreements _ an issue at the
heart of the class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Monsanto withdrew its filing for Justice Department
approval of the Delta and Pine Land acquisition, ending a $1.9
billion deal proposed 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Top executives at Monsanto have likened the new world of
agriculture to the technology revolution under way in Silicon
Valley: Monsanto is Microsoft or Intel, writing the software and
driving the information-laden seed into the market.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shapiro, the chief executive at Monsanto, who will become
chairman of the combined company, says the company is committed to
biotechnology. Eventually, he says, the public and the stock market
will come to see the value of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underneath all the media noise is what has happened: In
biotechnology we've had the most successful product launch in the
history of agriculture,'' Shapiro said in an interview last week.
``What we are doing and what people think of us will eventually
come into alignment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, stock analysts see more public pressure and
shareholder doubts about the agriculture division. Biotechnology
executives say it is the price Monsanto has to pay for being a
pioneer.

REWARDED FOR CHECHNYA WAR, RUSSIAN PREMIER VOWS TO TURN TO DOMESTIC
ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-ASSESS, RUSSIA-AID) 
(ms) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, newly confirmed in the
parliamentary elections as Russia's current political hero for his
tough conduct of the war in Chechnya, signaled Monday that he was
now prepared to put his stamp on domestic issues _ to meet voters'
demands, as he said, for ``new results, new ideas and new
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Putin, 47, opened up the second stage of a Kremlin
campaign that has already made him a clear favorite _ at least for
now _ to succeed President Boris Yeltsin in elections set for June.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was not a candidate, Putin, who was named prime
minister just four months ago, emerged as the political winner in
the parliamentary vote on Sunday when two parties he endorsed _
both brand-new political concoctions _swept into parliament on his
coattails, together collecting more than 30 percent of the votes
cast along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly strong showing by the pair _ an obscure
coalition known as Unity, or Medved, which means Bear, and the
Union of Right Forces, a party of liberal economic reformers _ put
Putin within reach of a working majority in the 450-seat
parliament, depending on shifting alliances with other parties and
the more than 100 deputies elected independently.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, however, were skeptical of the cohesiveness and
goals of Unity in particular, a party that was slapped together by
the Kremlin in October as a late-hour entry in a vicious and often
ugly campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first time we have a virtual party in parliament,''
said Vyacheslav Nikonov, a political analyst with the anti-Kremlin
center-left opposition. ``Unity has no organization, no program, no
nothing, not even people you can name.''
</P>
<P>
   With 84 percent of the vote counted, Unity, headed by
Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu, polled 23.4 percent of the
national vote _ just behind the Communist Party's showing of 24.2
percent. The Union of Right Forces, headed by former Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko, won 8.7 percent of the national vote.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin officials Monday hailed the results as a breakthrough in
the decade-long stalemate between Yeltsin and successive
parliaments that for most of his tenure has been dominated by a
Communist-led opposition. ``In Russia, a revolution has taken
place, a peaceful one but a revolution all the same,'' said Igor
Shabdurasulov, a top Kremlin aide.
</P>
<P>
   Western experts said the strong showing by pro-government
parties could give the Kremlin the backing it needs to pass
long-awaited reform legislation, including a new tax law, and a law
allowing the buying and selling of land, which until now has been
blocked by the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This opens a lot of possibilities that no one had expected,''
said Anders Aslund, a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace. ``Putin can now change the political stage
by having a reformist parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   But in some minds, the Kremlin's use of hard-ball tactics in the
campaign left doubts about its commitments to genuine economic and
democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What shocks me about the Western reaction is this is seen as a
triumph for democracy in Russia while in my mind, it is completely
the opposite,'' said Nikonov. ``In my mind, it is a defeat of civic
society and a victory for the Family, which I consider the most
anti-democratic force in Russia.'' The Family is a term for the
Yeltsin entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, was also
dubious. ``Expectations that we will have a national policy
supporting the interests of all Russian and not clans and groups _
I do not think we will get this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a former KGB officer who was a political unknown when he
was appointed prime minister in August, has already signaled that
he would endorse parts of an economic platform put forward by the
Union of Right Forces.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's political views remain something of a mystery,
although his links to Yeltsin's democratic reform movement date to
the early 1990's, when he joined the administration of Anatoly
Sobchak, a democratic reformer who was then mayor of St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Russian news agencies Monday, Putin said
his cabinet would do its best to work with the new Duma, the lower
house of parliament, ``not only on economic legislation, but also
on other decisions important to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must and will work with everybody in the new Duma no matter
what party, group or coalition he or she belongs to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party, still in first place as Russia's largest
party, will continue to be a major player in parliament. They will
have a minimum of 111 seats of their own, but may command a bloc of
up to 150 votes, according to some experts. In the last parliament,
the Communists drew on support from small left-wing parties and
independent deputies, to garner more than 200 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those parties have since split, or even vanished. A new
anti- Kremlin electoral bloc, Fatherland _ All Russia, headed by
former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, polled only 12.6 percent.
That was a poor showing for an electoral bloc that as recently as
last summer was expected to sweep the parliamentary elections as
the favorite of the political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The final makeup of parliament will be determined by the outcome
in 224 individual districts where candidates run in local races,
similar to American Congressional elections. In those elections,
candidates can run with party affiliation or as independents.
</P>
<P>
   In an election widely seen as a trial run for next summer's
presidential contest, attention was fixed on the contest between
political parties, which fill the parliament's remaining 225 seats
in proportion to the national vote for party lists.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Russian system, a party must get at least 5 percent of
the national vote to qualify for seats in parliament; votes cast
for parties that fail to make the threshold are distributed to the
winners.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's elections, six parties cleared the 5 percent hurdle,
including Yabloko, a liberal opposition party, with 6.1 percent,
and the party led by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, a nationalist
maverick, which got 6.1 percent. Both Zhirinovsky and Grigory A.
Yavlinsky, leader of Yabloko, are regarded as potential allies for
the government on certain issues.
</P>
<P>
   According to results so far, Fatherland _ All Russia already
claims 63 seats, with 76 for Unity, 30 for the Union of Right
Forces, 25 for Yabloko and 18 for Zhirinovsky's party. Still to
come are results from many individual districts.

A LEADING ALTERNATIVE TO NUCLEAR TESTS FALTERS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since late August, an effort to build the world's largest laser
has suffered a series of embarrassments that have tarnished the
project's reputation and undermined its role as leading
justification for a ban on nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Now Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says the entire project and
its management may have to be restructured, amid soaring cost
overruns. And at least one senator has raised questions about
whether tiny nuclear explosions to be triggered by the lasers would
violate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In the National Ignition Facility, or NIF, as the project is
known, powerful lasers would be used to create conditions similar
to those in nuclear weapons, allowing scientists to study the
reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile without tests. The
lasers, under construction at the Energy Department's Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California, would crush and heat
pellets of nuclear fuel with 192 converging beams, generating a
rapid release of fusion energy.
</P>
<P>
   That release would create conditions similar to those created by
nuclear weapons, allowing scientists to study their properties.
Government scientists say that the laser project is a crucial
component of the nation's effort to ensure the safety and
reliability of its aging nuclear stockpile without actually testing
the weapons in nuclear explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its applications to weapons, moreover, physicists hope
that NIF will help them understand the behavior of materials under
extreme conditions and explore the possibility that nuclear fusion
could be used for the peaceful generation of power.
</P>
<P>
   But NIF, originally estimated to cost $1.2 billion, has been
plagued by scheduling delays, technical problems and cost overruns
that could go as high as a third of that figure. Its former
director, E. Michael Campbell, took a leave of absence in August
after questions arose about his academic credentials and announced
last week that he was resigning from the laboratory. And even
though $800 million has been spent and construction has been under
way since 1997, unhappiness in Congress with the overruns means the
project faces the threat of cancellation. In the latest blow, a
letter to Richardson in late October, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,
questioned whether such experiments themselves might violate the
``zero yield'' provision in Article I of the treaty, which would
prohibit any nuclear test of any size. Successful experiments on
NIF would release the energy equivalent of about 15 pounds of TNT
in an extremely small fraction of a second within a contained
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is troubling that we are planning to ignite thermonuclear
explosions at NIF that may violate the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty's ban on nuclear explosions,'' Harkin said in a statement on
the letter, citing the administration's pledge not to test while
continuing to seek ratification of the treaty, which he also
supports.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the letter, officials at the State Department and
the Energy Department said that laser fusion experiments of lower
power had always been granted special exemptions during
negotiations for test ban treaties, including the latest one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a fair question that deserves an answer,'' John
Holum, senior adviser to the secretary of state for arms control
and international security, said of the issue Harkin had raised.
Holum, who helped negotiate the test ban treaty, added that during
negotiations with other parties to the treaty, ``we specifically
carved out that activity as something we expected to continue under
a zero yield treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   But the brevity of the Senate's debate on the beleaguered treaty
precluded a full discussion of such points, Holum said. The Senate
refused to ratify the treaty in October but the Clinton
administration still supports the treaty. While the treaty has
little chance of passage next year, it is likely to be a campaign
issue.
</P>
<P>
   More serious consequences for the program could emerge from
Richardson's recent finding that cost overruns may have been
deliberately hidden from him and from upper management at Lawrence
Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   According to Campbell, whose formal title was associate director
for laser programs, the cost overruns involve the assembly of the
multitude of delicate, high-tech parts, a task that turned out to
be more challenging than expected.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Richardson said that preliminary
investigations had shown ``there may have been an effort of
concealment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Campbell bore significant responsibility for NIF's
troubles. Campbell took a leave of absence in late August after it
was disclosed that he did not have a Ph.D., as he had led people to
believe. He now has announced he will leave the laboratory after
the completion of NIF reviews of the project expected to be
finished soon.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Campbell said in an interview that the overruns,
whose magnitude was still being estimated, had originally been
discovered in a review of the project that had been initiated at
his direction. Campbell said there was no delay in reporting the
problems and no effort to conceal them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the guy in charge,'' he added, ``so I accept whatever
responsibility the secretary chooses to assign to me. I hope he
gets on with the project and encourages the good people who have
worked and are still working so hard to make it succeed.''

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he had found that mismanagement of the project
went well beyond laboratory officials. In September, he withheld $2
million of a performance fee from the University of California,
which manages the laboratory for the Energy Department. And he said
that some responsibility was borne by officials at the Energy
Department who manage the overall program to ensure the safety and
reliability of nuclear weapons without testing, called stockpile
stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Reis, a former assistant secretary of energy, who ran the
stockpile stewardship program until July, responded that strict
limits on staffing at the Energy Department had forced it to rely
over the years on assessments of the project by Livermore and
outside organizations, like the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those reviews stated specifically that the
program was on track, both in terms of schedule and cost, and every
review reiterated the program's critical importance to the
stockpile stewardship program,'' Reis said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The last of those reviews was completed early this year, before
the overruns finally became known.
</P>
<P>
   John McTague, a former vice president for technical affairs at
Ford Motor Co., who is leading one of the Energy Department's new
reviews of NIF, said that the size of the project might have made
gauging its ultimate cost and schedule particularly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you look at the physical scale, it's colossal,''
McTague said. ``It's bigger than Ben Hur,'' he said of the roughly
football-stadium-size project.
</P>
<P>
   McTague agreed that the cost overruns arose mainly because the
NIF plan had underestimated the difficulty of assembling the
individual parts of such a complex project. In particular, it
turned out to be more difficult than thought to fabricate the long
chambers through which the laser beams must travel before reaching
the target. Those chambers must be kept ultraclean in order to
prevent motes of dust from disrupting the powerful laser beams.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime critics of the project, including the Natural Resources
Defense Council, an environmental group based in Washington,
disputed that assessment, saying that NIF suffered from technical
problems as well as mismanagement. Difficulties in producing the
laser's optics and fuel pellets, they say, could prevent it from
ever operating properly. But George Miller, the associate director
for national security at Livermore, who now oversees the project,
maintained that its problems were more managerial than technical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shown that the fundamental technical problems are
soluble,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that the project was also considered to be crucial
for the future of Livermore, a weapons laboratory that is
struggling to stay afloat after the end of the Cold War. Work at
the site would also include unclassified research on the use of
laser fusion to generate energy for peaceful purposes, like power

</P>
<P>
   Miller said that the project was also critical to the success of
the $4.5 billion stockpile stewardship program, although some
scientists and bomb designers have disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   The task now, Richardson said, will be to restructure the
project once a complete report on the cost overruns becomes
available in mid-January. Changes, he said, may include extending
the construction schedule, increasing managerial accountability and
perhaps more personnel moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very, very poorly managed and poorly implemented,''
Richardson said, ``but it's a sound science project.''

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In a move intended to provide seamless
service along growing trade corridors, Burlington Northern Santa Fe
and the Canadian National Railway said Monday that they have agreed
to combine operations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal creates the largest rail company in North America, with
its headquarters and leadership to be based in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said there will be little disruption for employees
or shippers because the rail networks do not overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Northern, which moved to Fort Worth from St. Paul,
Minn., in 1984, employs about 3,200 in Fort Worth, including 2,500
at its corporate headquarters. Executives said the combined company
will maintain a major presence in North Texas, including its
dispatch center.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the structuring of the deal, which gives a
majority of top management posts to Canadian National officials,
satisfies protectionist laws in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the rail companies employ about 67,000 in two
countries, and executives said that only a few thousand jobs will
be lost, probably through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   The merger requires approval from regulators and shareholders in
the United States and Canada, and executives said they do not
expect to complete the transaction until mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, a new holding company will be created, to be called
North American Railways. It would generate more than $12.5 billion
in annual revenue, and its 50,000 miles of track would cover much
of the continent.
</P>
<P>
   The system would stretch from Los Angeles to Halifax, Nova
Scotia, and from Vancouver to the Texas Gulf Coast. It would be
especially strong, analysts said, along the north-south corridors
that connect Mexico, Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That has become a busy route since the North American Free Trade
Agreement was approved early this decade, and traffic is expected
to grow sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``A map of this new railroad is truly incredible,'' said Robert
Krebs, Burlington's chief executive, during a news conference in
Montreal. ``This is a perfect time for us to get together.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies did not put a value on the deal, saying it was a
tax-free stock swap that does not pay a premium to shareholders of
either company.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington investors will receive one share in North American
Railways for each share in BNSF, while Canadian investors will get
1.05 shares. Burlington shareholders will control about two-thirds
of the stock in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the companies have a total market value topping $18
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted negatively to the deal, however, pushing
down the stock prices of both rail operators. In late trading at
4:15 p.m. Monday, Burlington's stock was down $3.5625, to $24.8125.
Canadian's stock fell $1.35 (Canadian) to $42.85 (Canadian) on the
Toronto exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal does not provide enough of a premium to
Burlington investors. And they noted that Canadian's top executive,
Paul Tellier, will be at the helm of the holding company, with his
associates making up most of the staff.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal closes, Krebs said he will become non-executive
chairman of the new company. Matthew Rose, currently president of
Burlington, will add the title of chief executive of Burlington
Northern Santa Fe, and is expected to remain at the Fort Worth
office.
</P>
<P>
   Another Burlington official, chief financial officer Thomas
Hund, will become CFO of North American.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member board of directors will include six members from
each company, plus three appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the rail companies said that the merger
willbenefit shareholders over the long-term by providing more
growth opportunities and lower operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts, noting the long regulatory process, said the gains
will be far down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``In three to five years, this will be the premier freight
railroad in North America,'' Terry Gardner, an analyst at Deutsche
Banc Alex Brown, told TheStreet.com. ``But the issue here is
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to submit their business plans to regulators
within 90 days. The U.S. Surface Transportation Board may review
the plans for as long as a year, officials said. A Canadian court,
which considers both the payout to shareholders and regulatory
laws, also must approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian National was a state railway until the government sold
it to the public in a 1995 stock offering. Executives acknowledged
that this deal was structured to meet Canadian rules that still
govern the business.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the new company's headquarters will be in Montreal;
a majority of its directors will be Canadian citizens; and no
single company will control 15 percent of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many Canadians, there's always a concern about `sleeping
with the elephant,' '' said Tony Hine, managing director of
National Bank Financial in Toronto. ``Economic nationalism is still
a big factor in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, one reporter asked whether a Canadian
company is being ``Americanized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the Americanization of CN,'' said Tellier,
Canadian National's chief executive. ``This is transforming CN into
a true North American company, while retaining a very strong
Canadian identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Krebs quickly cited the Montreal headquarters, the makeup of the
board, and the fact that Tellier, a Canadian, will be CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been extremely sensitive to that very issue,'' Krebs
said.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter added that Canadian law required those
concessions, Krebs added: ``It's the right thing to do, and we're
very happy to do it. Or we wouldn't be involved in this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The rail industry has always been marked by mergers, as
companies sought to expand their markets, offer better service and
boost profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Burlington-Canadian deal was driven by similar factors,
Krebs and Tellier said. In the first three years as a combined
company, they expect to generate as much as $600 million in
additional operating income by pulling in new business and cutting
costs.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about offering automakers a single rail line to
reach from Ontario and Detroit into California and Mexico. Other
routes would entice chemical makers from the Gulf Coast and lumber
companies in Canada, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What shippers want is seamless service with a single line,''
Tellier said. ``They want to deal with one bill, one invoice, one
account manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trucking's already there,'' he added. ``Now we want to be
fully integrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Shippers signalled some skepticism. Major mergers have rocked
the rail industry in this decade, often disrupting traffic as
companies tried to blend their computer systems and far-flung rail
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Union Pacific and Southern Pacific, along with Norfolk
Southern and CSX, have struggled to integrate lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we need another mega-merger when the industry is
already having trouble providing reliable service?'' said Ed
Emmett, president of the National Industrial Transportation League,
a trade group that represents shippers. ``We don't need it now.''

U.S. ASKS DELAY ON $500 MILLION FOR RUSSIAN OIL COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-ASSESS and RUSSIA-ELECT) 
(ms) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration asked the Export-Import
Bank of the United States Monday to delay $500 million in aid to a
Russian oil company as a protest over continued resistance to
economic reforms and, more obliquely, to step up pressure to end
the military campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But the chairman of the bank, James A. Harmon, said Monday night
that he expected the board of the independent agency would probably
reject the request, which he argued was based on an extremely loose
reading of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary of state has the right to instruct the board to
deny the loan on the basis of `national interest,''' Harmon said in
an interview Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   That is a step that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has
apparently been unwilling to take, at least so far, in hope that a
delay would be enough to send a warning signal to the Russians and,
perhaps, might effectively kill the loan.
</P>
<P>
   But delay itself, Harmon said, ``is not one of the state
department's options, as we understand the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The request to the bank was made Monday night after considerable
debate in the administration, caught between its desire to remain
economically engaged in Russia and its fear that it will be seen as
underwriting companies that have resisted Western-style economic
reforms. Complicating the politics has been the military action in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Chechnya,'' a senior administration official said
Monday, ``I suspect that this would have gone through already.''
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is the kind that in other times would hardly
garner much notice. The bank is scheduled to meet Tuesday to decide
on loan guarantees to Tyumen Oil Co., a business in Siberia. The
Russian government owns nearly half the company.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year Tyumen has been involved in a dispute
involving another oil company whose assets it has been trying to
acquire. Along the way, Tyumen has been accused by BP Amoco and
George Soros, the international investor, of using unscrupulous
tactics to acquire the business and its huge oil field. Both the
company and Soros are investors in the target company.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, lobbying in the case has been fierce. BP Amoco and
Soros are pressing to have the Export-Import Bank loan killed,
perhaps hoping that would give them leverage in negotiating with
Tyumen. BP Amoco has been negotiating with Tyumen over a compromise
deal that could be completed soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the opponents of the deal have found that they have allies
in the White House, including officials who a year or two ago were
advocating more help for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, President Clinton's economic adviser, has made it
clear that he believes Tyumen ``may have abused the rule of law.''
Sperling was part of a White House group that forwarded a Central
Intelligence Agency study of the company's actions to Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers called Harmon from Europe
last week, saying there were ``significant questions'' about the
company and its efforts to manipulate the Russian legal system to
its advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they are a bit mystified by
Harmon's resistance to their calls for a delay. But Harmon argues
that he is doing what the law calls for him to do, to make loan
decisions based on commercial, not political, considerations.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has two primary criteria, whether an export would
create American jobs _ in this case jobs that would produce
oil-drilling and environmental equipment _ and whether the foreign
company is creditworthy. ``We believe this meets those standards,''
Harmon said.

 No-Mow Grass In Works  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Michael Neff was out mowing his lawn in Southern California when
inspiration struck.
<P>
   It occurred to him that this tiresome chore could be virtually
eliminated by creating genetically engineered ``dwarf grass'' that
would grow much more slowly than ordinary grass.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than a year later, Neff and other scientists have
succeeded in isolating a gene that limits stem growth in plants.
This ``dwarf gene'' may allow growers to restrict the height of
grass, trees and other plants.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were detailed in a paper published in yesterday's
edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is incredibly exciting,'' Neff said in a telephone
interview from St. Louis, where he is now an assistant professor of
plant genetics at Washington University. ``It's a huge step
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the research, Neff was working as a postdoctoral
fellow at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not ever going to be able to create a plant that
doesn't need pruning,'' he said. ``Plants need to grow to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you have something that grows slower, you would have to
spend less time maintaining it and use less fertilizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with creating a dark green lawn that hardly ever needs to
be mowed, Neff said the dwarf gene potentially could lead to
pint-size fruit trees capable of maximizing output in limited
areas, or stronger, tighter timber for the building industry.
</P>
<P>
   The key word here is ``potentially.'' Neff stressed that while
the gene in question could theoretically be introduced to various
types of plants, scientists have yet to see how it would affect
grass or trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot of experiments to do,'' he said. ``But we
are right on the edge of a tremendous amount of things that could
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Neff declined to speculate on when such genetically engineered
plants could be developed. But when pressed, he said a no-mow grass
could be concocted in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, there are doubters, especially as far as
new-and-improved grass is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see the end product,'' said Ali Harivandi, an
environmental horticulturist at a University of California plant
research facility in Alameda. ``I have a suspicion this might not
work.''
</P>
<P>
   His chief concern is that a slow-growing grass would not
accommodate the wear and tear of foot traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it is damaged, it would not grow back,'' Harivandi said.
``When a lawn is damaged from playing football, for example, it
will recover by growing back.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also worried that dwarf grass would have an unusually
shallow root system, making it more susceptible to injury. This is
the case with other strains of slow-growing grass that have been
bred over the years by horticulturists.
</P>
<P>
   But Joanne Chory, the Salk Institute professor cited as ``senior
author'' on the dwarf-gene paper (Neff is ``first author''), said
the genetically altered plants may not be prone to such setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be possible to make short or dwarf plants that are
completely normal in every other way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Salk researchers took a tobacco plant that would normally grow
to six feet tall and engineered it to reach maturity at just 12
inches.
</P>
<P>
   A hardy, long-lasting grass that might normally grow to 12
inches could be limited in theory to mature at just a fraction of
this amount _ a mere two inches, say.
</P>
<P>
   This would be bad news for professional gardeners. Some might
find their workload significantly reduced as homeowners rush to
plant low-maintenance lawns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're strictly a mow-and-blow type of person, this could
cause problems,'' said Robert Scudder, who runs a San Francisco
landscaping firm and serves on the board of the San Francisco
Professional Gardeners Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think that highly qualified gardeners would have a lot
of other stuff to be involved in,'' he added, noting that there are
hedges to be pruned and trees to be trimmed. ``Mowing lawns isn't
the only thing we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, what if the dwarf gene could be used to create hedges
that do not need to be pruned, or trees that require no trimming?
</P>
<P>
   Scudder dismissed such speculation. First, he does not think
such a brave new world of landscaping ever will emerge. Moreover,
he said professional gardeners, like plants, will adapt to changing
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be a need for someone out there caring
for plants,'' Scudder said. ``Even with bioengineering, there's
always going to be a need for a gardener.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Neff, who played such an instrumental role in what could
dramatically alter the lifestyles of homeowners the world over, is
it too soon to be thinking about the Nobel Prize?
</P>
<P>
   Neff said it's way too early for such talk. ``But I'm sure
someone on the committee mows their own lawn,'' he said.

 VeriSign Purchasing 2 Firms  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Shares of Mountain View's VeriSign Inc. soared almost 15 percent
yesterday after the seller of Internet security technology
announced plans to scoop up two privately held firms that develop
e-commerce software for about $1.4 billion.
<P>
   VeriSign said it will purchase Signio Inc. of Redwood Shores for
stock valued at about $840 million, &LR;  and South Africa's Thawte
Consulting for stock valued at $575million. VeriSign stock closed
at $150.13 per share, up $19.19.
</P>
<P>
   VeriSign is the No. 1 provider of ``digital certificates'' that
verify and identify people and Web sites during online
communication. Online retailers and others license the software to
keep orders and credit card information sent over the Internet
private and secure.
</P>
<P>
   Thawte is the second-largest seller of digital certificates.
After acquiring its biggest rival, VeriSign said it will control 90
percent of the digital certificate market.
</P>
<P>
   By purchasing Thawte, which targets smaller e-commerce shops,
VeriSign has both broadened and deepened its client base, said
Nicole Schmidt, an Internet analyst at Josephthal &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``VeriSign has been trying to target the high-end _
BlueMountain, Amazon, Bluefly _ Thawte is going after the Web sites
of people selling widgets ... who are operating on a shoestring
budget,'' she &UR;  &LR; said.
</P>
<P>
   Signio provides software that transmits online transaction data,
essentially acting as a bridge between Web sites and credit card
processors. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By acquiring Signio, VeriSign hopes to expand beyond the
Internet-security market by offering payment services to online
retailers and other merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two acquisitions will expand VeriSign's market,
Schmidt questioned the high prices VeriSign is paying _ about 150
times revenues for the two companies combined. She estimates that
Signio has only $1 million in annual sales and Thawte has $6
million to $9 million in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``In in  &LR; some ways there's been a disconnect in the market,''
she said. ``It seems there's an inverse relationship between
revenues and valuation.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said Signio appears to have limited growth opportunity
because many companies like eToys, Kmart and Macy's have already
built their own payment processing systems.
</P>
<P>
   But VeriSign chief executive Stratton Sclavos said both deals
are worth the steep sums, particularly as more merchants shift
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is really in its infancy,'' he said. ``We've done
200,000 Web sites with our authentication services and we think the
market is more like 10 million.''
</P>
<P>
   VeriSign hopes to close the deals in the first quarter of next
year. After the mergers, the company will employ about 530,
including 400 in the Bay Area.

 _ SF CHRON   Retirement Is a Risk But It's a Good One 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I am 70 years old but still earning about $70,000 per year as a
real-estate broker. My wife and I would like to move to Carmel
Valley, where I might continue to work _ but very little, because I
want to spend most days playing golf. We would have $1,700 per
month from Social Security and could meet the rest of our expenses
by liquidating 5 percent of our securities portfolio each year. (It
is worth $925,000.) We also own a home with about $725,000 worth of
equity and would sell it and buy another in the $450,000 range. Do
you think we can pull this off?
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably.
</P>
<P>
   If you could tell me exactly how long you and your wife are
going to live, exactly how the stock market will perform during
that period, and what the inflation rate will be each year, then it
would be possible to give you a definite answer.
</P>
<P>
   Barring that, we have to fall back on the averages. The average
annual stock-market performance over many decades is about an 11
percent gain, including dividends. The average rate of inflation is
about 3 percent. If the market were to go up 11 percent every year
and your expenses were to increase by 3 percent every year, then
you could liquidate 5 percent of your portfolio every year forever.
</P>
<P>
   However, the stock market and inflation don't always behave in a
neat, orderly fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you retire, and stocks suddenly begin a long, severe
bear market. Let's say the principal market averages decline by
more than 40 percent, while inflation shoots above 10 percent
annually. As paranoid as that scenario seems, you can't rule it
out, because it happened in 1973 and 1974. If it happened again, it
might put a notable crimp in your standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, that kind of economic havoc might never occur
again during the remainder of your lifetime. If you let worst-case
scenarios intimidate you, then you'll never retire. Almost
everybody who retires has to be a bit of a risk taker.
</P>
<P>
   If I were in your shoes, I would take the risk. However, I would
set aside a little time each evening to pray for continued economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IRA Contributions
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Suppose I report $3,000 in salary on line 7 of tax Form
1040, &LR;  and a $3,000 capital loss from stock sales on line 13,
netting out to total taxable income of zero. Would I be eligible to
contribute to an individual retirement account that year?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that you report more than $2,000 in wages entitles you
to contribute up to the $2,000 annual maximum to an IRA, says
Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller. You won't lose
this right because you report an offsetting capital loss. Losing
the money is penalty enough. (And, by the way, how did you lose
money in this one-way stock market?)
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with an IRA ought to obtain a copy of IRS Publication
590, entitled `'Individual Retirement Arrangements,'' which spells
out just about every rule you need to know. You can download it
from the IRS Web site at www.irs.gov, or telephone for a copy at
(800) 829-3676.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Pay Debt or Invest?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it better to pay off debt before investing in mutual funds
or stocks? I have approximately $7,000 in credit-card debt at 16
percent interest and am also making payments on a car and school
loans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: It depends on how good an investor you think you are.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you have $7,000 in cash available today to either invest
or pay off all your credit-card debt. If you don't pay off the
debt, it will grow by 16 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   So, your goal as an investor would be to make your $7,000 in
cash grow by more than 16 percent per year after taxes. &UR;  &LR; I say
after taxes, because you would be paying your credit-card debt with
after-tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know which tax bracket you are in, but to accomplish
your goal you probably would have to produce a pretax investment
return of more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is way above the stock market's historical average return
of 11 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you probably could have earned a 20-plus
return in almost any of the past five years, when the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was gaining an average of more than 27 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
   You don't say what interest rate you are paying on your car and
school loans; probably less than 16 percent. But the logic is the
same: You compare the interest you are paying with your expected
payoff from investing.

 Rising Housing Costs, Labor Shortages May Cause
California's  Growth to Slow 
 &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The California economy is expected to slow slightly in 2000 as a
labor shortage and housing crunch dampen growth _ particularly in
the technology-driven Bay Area.
<P>
   Tom Lieser, director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast, is
projecting a 2.7 percent increase in nonfarm employment in the
state next year, compared with the 2.8 percent rise expected in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   But on the cusp of the new millennium, the California economy is
already showing signs of deceleration. Lieser's 2.8 percent
projection for this year is significantly lower than his original
estimate of 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And in the San Francisco metropolitan area, which includes the
counties of San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin, the number of jobs
created dropped precipitously to 2 percent this year from 3 percent
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great demand for what the Bay Area is producing and I
don't see any near-term end to it,'' Lieser said. ``The question is
whether it will be too costly for (those jobs) to stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   One dramatic example of the Bay Area employment dilemma is the
Transamerica Corp., the venerable insurance company whose
pyramid-shaped headquarters defines the San Francisco skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Only 150 top executives and their staff were left in the
Transamerica Pyramid when the company was sold to Aegon NV earlier
this year _ down from 2,400 people working there in the mid-1980s.
Most employees were transferred to cheaper areas like Chicago,
Dallas and Los Angeles. Offices in the Pyramid, meanwhile, were
rented at sky-high rates to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Many other San Francisco corporate pillars, from Chevron Corp.
to Gap Inc., also maintain sizable offices outside of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, San Francisco's jobless rate hit a rock-bottom 2.4
percent in November _ strong evidence that there aren't enough
workers to go around, Lieser said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, November unemployment was 5.4 percent in the Los
Angeles area and 4.1 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local construction is slowing and Bay Area home
prices are rising 12 percent a year, with no relief in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area home prices are now more than double the national
average _ a median price of $305,000 for a single-family dwelling,
compared with about $140,000 nationally, according to
Acxiom/Dataquick. The California median is $197,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly in the Bay Area, the housing problem must now be
viewed as a major constraint to growth,'' said Ted Gibson, chief
economist with the state Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   Although exports are starting to pick up, ``under these
circumstances, I'm not sure companies will want to expand in the
Bay Area since they won't be able to find housing for their
workers,'' Gibson said. ``That's a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as job creation slows, sky-high compensation among the
ranks of the employed is keeping the state economy barreling along.
That's especially true in the Bay Area, with its generous salaries,
bonuses and stock options, Lieser said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending is accelerating at a blistering pace. Lieser
forecasts a jump of 8.9 percent this year and 5.8 percent in 2000,
up from 5.2 percent in 1998. Since the housing market is so tight,
much of the money is being spent on remodeling and furniture
upgrades in existing homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Incomes, meanwhile, are forecast to rise 6.4 percent in 1999 and
6.1 percent in 2000, increases that are robust but short of last
year's 6.9 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
   California's export sector, which had suffered from low
worldwide demand, particularly among struggling Asian countries, is
another area of optimism for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   State exports rebounded with a 10.2 percent increase in the
third quarter after falling 4.2 percent in 1998 and the same amount
in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Economies throughout most of the world, from Italy to Thailand
to Mexico, are strengthening _ and so is the demand for California
products, particularly electronic equipment, according to Lieser.
</P>
<P>
   Still, much of the state's future growth will be generated
outside of the Bay Area, since impediments to living and doing
business here are so great, economists predict.
</P>
<P>
   New construction, as measured by residential and commercial
building permits, is booming in much of the state. For the first 10
months of the year, new permits in Los Angeles were up 21.6 percent
over the same period of 1998; statewide, permits jumped 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the issuance of building permits in Alameda and
Contra Costa counties declined 6.2 percent. Permits were also down
in San Jose and Sonoma, although they rose 3.9 percent in San
Francisco, San Mateo and Marin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic; you have an economy that wants to grow and local
governments that won't let it,'' said Gibson, who blames the local
housing shortage on an antigrowth mind-set among municipalities. He
forecast ``static'' employment in the Bay Area for the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area squeeze is good news for outlying areas. The number
of construction permits issued in the Salinas/Monterey region more
than doubled in the first 10 months of 1999 against the comparable
1998 period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even out in Martinez, there are houses starting in the
mid-500s,'' said Gibson. ``That's very illustrative of the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Sacramento area, companies like Intel and Hewlett-Packard
are expanding their facilities, Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern in the longer term is that even places like
Sacramento won't be an option,'' Lieser said. ``California is
uniformly expensive. We'll be fortunate if the state can hold onto
new job opportunities.''

THE MET OPERA'S CHALLENGE IN DRESSING `GATSBY'

(DW) 
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Harbison's ``Great Gatsy,'' which opened Monday
night at the Metropolitan Opera with Dawn Upshaw and Jerry Hadley
in the roles of the Long Island lovebirds, will probably not do for
shirt sales what the Robert Redford film version did in 1974. In
the famous scene when Gatsby nonchalantly tosses his many-colored
shirts in the air, Hadley has a mere handful, while Redford had a
heap.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as Jane Greenwood, the costume designer for the Met's
production, noted dryly of not the least of the differences between
the leading men, ``Redford cannot sing opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving voice to F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel of wealth and
reckless yearning presents challenges that go well beyond the
``right'' shoe or the correct display of women's knees. Yet,
because of the movie's extravagant costumes, which generated enough
buzz to make the covers of both Time and Newsweek and to land a
number of commercial tie-ins, from shirts and ice-cream-colored
suits to white Teflon pants, lots of people know what Gatsby looked
like even if his personality remained in shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren, then at the beginning of his ultra-dreamy career,
designed the clothes for Redford, as well as for the other male
actors. Although Theoni V. Aldredge ultimately won the Academy
Award for the film's costumes, it was Lauren's designs that created
the most stir, partly because fashion editors around the country
immediately picked up on the look for their magazine and newspaper
columns, and partly because Lauren, ne Lifshitz, seemed to have the
same longings that had transformed the young roughneck Jimmy Gatz
into Jay Gatsby.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the movie, which Paramount made for $6.4 million,
was so high, in fact, that when the studio held its gala premiere,
on March 27, 1974, people came dressed in flapper beads and
feathers. Fitzgerald's daughter, Scottie Lanahan Smith, brought 28
friends and relatives from Montgomery, Ala. As for Lauren, he felt
both elated and frustrated by what would turn out to be his only
Hollywood costume job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so thrilled, because it was everything that I believed
in, and I was unknown at the time,'' he said last week. But it
rankled Lauren that he didn't receive equal billing with Ms.
Aldredge, a veteran costume designer. He added, ``It was not a
great experience in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, it was Lauren whom the Met first approached to
design the costumes for the ``Gatsby'' opera. ``I talked to him a
lot, and we had some marvelous discussions,'' said Mark Lamos, the
production's director. Flattered by the offer, Lauren said he
almost accepted, but declined because of business demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been an amazing amount of work, and I felt like
I did `Gatsby' in the movie,'' he said. ``For the opera, you have
to be very concerned with the period, so there wasn't a lot of room
for originality.''
</P>
<P>
   In a quirk of fate, one of those who joined Mrs. Smith's
contingent for the film premiere was Jane Greenwood, who last April
began designing costumes for the latest ``Gatsby.''
</P>
<P>
   A lanky Englishwoman with deadpan delivery, Ms. Greenwood
remembered staying with Mrs. Smith in Montgomery, where Ms.
Greenwood's husband had relatives, and being knocked out when she
was browsing through a bookcase. ``I thought, My goodness _ here's
every first edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   It is Ms. Greenwood's inspired use of the same hot colors that
appeared on Francis Cugat's dust-jacket design for the first
edition of ``The Great Gatsby,'' in 1925, that give the opera's
riotous party scenes their sinful look. ``You always associate
pastels with the 1920s, but I didn't want to do that,'' Ms.
Greenwood said. Cavorting against Michael Yeargan's minimalist
backdrop, the dancers and chorus, in acid tones of orange, blue,
fuchsia and yellow, look electric.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting halfway back in the house during rehearsal, Ms.
Greenwood pointed to a pudgy chorus member in a
preposterous-looking blue panier skirt. ``That's a copy of a 1925
Lanvin,'' said Ms. Greenwood, whose film, stage and opera credits
include ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' ``Master Class'' and ``Dialogues
of the Carmelites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's wearing her stole wrong,'' Michael Zecher, an assistant,
whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greenwood made a note to fix that. During an earlier break,
Lamos had come over to Ms. Greenwood and asked whether the silk
wrapper worn by Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, who plays Myrtle Wilson,
the garage mechanic's floozy wife, should be shortened to show more
leg. Ms. Greenwood said she thought so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myrtle's a little bit more available,'' Lamos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a little,'' Ms. Greenwood agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Although she saw the movie version of ``The Great Gatsby,''
which starred Mia Farrow as Daisy Buchanan, Ms. Greenwood said she
avoided watching it again. In any case, the costume concerns of
opera are vastly different. ``In a movie, you can come in for a
close-up on a clasp of pearls,'' she said. ``But on the stage all
that detail is lost.'' She concentrated on color, mixing
contrasting textures like velvet and satin to bring out more depth,
and on period silhouettes, like the flowing, kimono-sleeved pink
jacket with pale blue ribbons that Ms. Upshaw wears as Daisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the silhouette doesn't read all the way to the back row,''
Ms. Greenwood said, ``then the icing doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   She also replicated foundation garments for the female singers,
to heighten their sense of reality while flattening their chests in
the boyish style of the era. In all, there are about 150 costumes,
made either by Angel in London or by Eric Winterling Ltd. in New
York. The millinery came from Lynne Mackey, and the shoes from
Pompei in Rome. ``He made all the shoes, and they nearly all fit,''
Ms. Greenwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Given his association with the movie, and his ability to exploit
and market such old-sport notions as taste and class, Lauren was
asked to give his opinion of the new ``Gatsby'' costumes. Looking
at some photographs from the flashy party scene, with its
rebellious hues and arching plumes, Lauren said, ``What I'm seeing
is that the women's clothes are beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wondered about Gatsby, whose style and well-worn tales of
collecting rubies and hunting big game could by turns provoke
incredulity and fascination in his listeners. ``He was really a
mysterious guy,'' Lauren said, ``and a lot of what he was about
came through the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, little of the character's complexity and verve come across
in the opera's costumes. The opera's Gatsby wears the flamboyant
pink suit that appeared in both the novel and the movie, now in a
shade close to strawberry soda, and he duly sports a light
caramel-colored suit (another sartorial reference from the book)
for his first afternoon with Daisy.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't look remarkably different from the other peacocks
on the stage, and when he begins throwing around his shirts _ no
significantly bold stripes, no plaids in coral or lavender, no
monograms in Indian blue _ it's hard to imagine what Daisy is
bawling about. &QL;

FORMER IRS OFFICIAL ALLEGES FAVORITISM FOR THE WELL-CONNECTED
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The top Internal Revenue Service official here
repeatedly gave wealthy and politically connected taxpayers
unwarranted breaks including reduced tax bills, a refund and
deferred payments in 1996 and 1997, the government's former chief
tax collector for the district testified Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Coons, tax collection chief for Northern California from
1995 until he was removed in February 1998, testified at a hearing
where he is trying to get his job back under a federal law that
protects whistle-blowers.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS contends that Coons was dismissed for looking at 253 Web
sites on his government computer, most of them travel or stock
market sites, but five of them featuring images of naked women. It
also says he initially lied to investigators about this.
</P>
<P>
   Coons, 55, has acknowledged some ``stupid'' misuse of the
computer, but says the charges are a smoke screen to obscure the
real reason for his removal. He says he stood in the way of a
pattern of favoritism for the wealthy, especially those represented
by former IRS executives and federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   No names of taxpayers were mentioned in Monday's testimony
before an administrative law judge for the Merit Systems Protection
Board, Phillip Reed. But records in the case show that the
taxpayers to whom Coons is referring include Al Davis, owner of the
Oakland Raiders football team; members of the Alioto family, whose
patriarch was mayor here in the 1960s; and a diamond company,
Golden ADA, which the federal government says was a Russian
diamond-for-cash money-laundering operation.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Alioto Jr. said that his family had a years-long dispute
with the IRS that included the sale of one brother's home and the
seizure of his mother's car, but that ``we never sought any special
treatment.'' Calls to Davis' secretary and publicist, and to his
tax lawyer, were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Coons said that in the Russian money-laundering case, he was
repeatedly urged to back off both by representatives of the company
and by federal prosecutors, the State Department and Russian
officials.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he complained repeatedly to Robert Ah Nee, the IRS
district director here, about these and other actions he considered
improper, but that Ah Nee just shrugged and said nothing. Coons
said one taxpayer who owed millions of dollars and had substantial
income received a major tax break, over his objections, to Ah Nee _
partly by threatening to go to the Senate Finance Committee, which
at the time was investigating the IRS. Public records show that the
testimony concerned Davis' tax case.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview earlier, Coons said that Ah Nee and his deputy,
Peggy Rule, told him not to enforce collections in another case
because seizing a mansion and selling it would ``create bad
publicity for the IRS, and we don't need that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them it would make every working stiff see that we
treated the rich the same way we treat them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that after this, the two officials cooled toward him.
</P>
<P>
   Coons said subordinates, in another case, brought him two years
of tax returns and a refund check for nearly $100,000, saying that
Ah Nee had personally ordered the check be issued. The subordinates
told Coons that they regarded the returns as fraudulent. Coons said
he went to Ah Nee to complain, but was told that his opinion did
not matter and that the issuing of the check would be delegated to
another official.
</P>
<P>
   An IRS lawyer, Richard Slizeski, through questioning of
witnesses Monday and Friday, sought to portray Coons as an
opportunist who, only after he was caught misusing his computer,
tried to refashion a series of routine disagreements into something
more.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Jensen, the IRS executive who demoted Coons in August,
testified that he regarded him as a whistle-blower, but that the
misuse of his computer and his denials were so serious that it left
him with no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   Reed refused to allow testimony by Frank Miceli, the IRS
compliance chief in the Western region. Mary Dryovage, Coons'
lawyer, wanted Miceli to testify that any punishment greater than a
two-week suspension was unwarranted and to discuss Coons' track
record as one of the most highly regarded executives in the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Although Coons has been dismissed as chief tax collector in
Northern California, he still collects money for the IRS _ for the
federal charity drive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Juergen Moser, one of the world's leading mathematicians who
helped develop an influential theory for analyzing the orbits of
planets, asteroids and other celestial bodies, died of prostate
cancer Dec. 17 in a hospital in Schwerzenbach, Switzerland. He was
71.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other talented young Germans who came of age after
Germany's glittering scientific establishment was gutted by the
Nazis, Moser emigrated to the United States in the mid-1950s, soon
after completing his doctorate. He spent most of his career at the
New York University Courant Institute, where he served for three
years as director.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 25 years in this country, Moser returned to Europe
in 1980 to rebuild the once-stellar Mathematics Research Institute
at the Federal Institute of Technology, Switzerland's equivalent of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Moser's research was inspired by problems that arose in
physics. A lifelong astronomy enthusiast who as a boy built model
gliders and as a father made boats for his children, Moser was
fascinated by problems involving the stability of motion, or lack
of it. He is best known for a fundamental contribution to celestial
mechanics, the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory, that he published,
in an article that appeared in a German journal in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The problem that Moser tackled, the stability of the solar
system, was one that had tantalized scientists for centuries. Will
the solar system remain as it is for all eternity, or will Jupiter
one day collide with Mars and Venus drift into the Sun? Isaac
Newton made his contribution to the invention of calculus while
trying to prove that celestial bodies always travel in elliptical
orbits.
</P>
<P>
   But Newton's proof applied only to systems that consisted of two
bodies, say Earth and the Sun. Nearly every leading 18th-century
mathematician took up the problem of systems with more elements, a
problem that involved both stable movements and unpredictable,
chaotic ones, but by the end of the 19th century, the celebrated
French mathematician Poincare had concluded that the problem was
essentially insoluble.
</P>
<P>
   The KAM theory addresses the following question: What happens to
well-behaved elliptical orbits if one tries to take into account
the small perturbations resulting from the gravitational pull of
smaller or more distant planets? In 1954, the Russian
mathematician, Andrei N. Kolmogorov, announced that he had found
the answer, arguing that if the disturbance was sufficiently small,
many but not all of the orderly motions would survive, with orderly
orbits coexisting alongside chaotic ones. But Kolmogorov outlined a
general theory without supplying complete proof. His student, V.I.
Arnold, proved one case; Moser proved another.
</P>
<P>
   Moser was just 27 and completely unknown when he was asked to
summarize Kolmogorov's argument for a mathematics journal and
discovered a critical gap in the Russian's argument. It took him
several years to produce the result that filled that gap. The
result created an immediate sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonderful thing is that KAM theory also applies to
airplane dynamics, submarine dynamics, automobile dynamics; in
fact, practically any dynamical system described by Newton's
laws.'' said Philip Holmes, an applied mathematician at Princeton
University, who with Florin Diacu wrote the book ``Celestial
Encounters,'' (Princeton University Press, 1996), a history of
dynamical systems theory.
</P>
<P>
   Though he went on to make other important contributions in
dynamical systems, Moser also worked in the field of partial
differential equations, the sorts of equations in which many of the
laws of physics, not to mention those of financial derivatives, are
formulated.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Moser was born on July 4, 1928, in the East Prussian
city of Koenigsberg. He grew up in an intellectual family that
spent summers at an aunt's country estate and evenings playing
Haydn and Bach. His mother played the piano, his father, a
psychiatrist, the violin, and young Juergen , the cello.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, he was drafted, along with his entire high school class,
into a military auxiliary force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trained to man antiaircraft guns against the bombers
attacking our town,'' he recalled in a letter to a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Too slight to lift the heavy explosives, he was assigned to
compute their trajectories. Many horrors, including the death of
his older brother and most of his classmates, followed. For more
than two years, he was always hungry, surviving by will and wit.
Once, after he had crossed into Russian territory, he was captured
briefly, held in a basement half-filled with water and starved for
a week. Afterward, he said, ``I succeeded in snatching a frozen
turnip which I believe may have saved my life.''
</P>
<P>
   What saved his mind was a habit of seeking refuge in mathematics
that he first developed in the barracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot about the outside world and thought about a
mathematical problem which I made up and tried to solve in my
head,'' he recalled. ``That was very soothing; the officers could
yell at me as much as they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he spent two years finishing high school in what
later became East Germany. He fled to the west in 1947 to study at
Goettingen. Most of the luminaries, including Richard Courant and
Carl Ludwig Siegel, had been driven out or left voluntarily before
the war. Moser came under Siegel's influence after he returned from
the United States in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   A Fulbright Scholarship allowed Moser to spend a year in New
York with the assemblage of emigres and young New Yorkers at the
institute established by Richard Courant. Before long, he was
spending weekends in the Courant house in New Rochelle, N.Y., with
its heavy Biedermeier furniture, grand piano and musical evenings
reminiscent of home, and was falling in love with Courant's eldest
daughter, Gertrude, a biologist.
</P>
<P>
   Moser returned briefly to Goettingen to work as Siegel's
assistant, writing a book on celestial mechanics with his mentor.
By September 1955, he was back at NYU and had married Gertrude
Courant. Two years later, he accepted a position at MIT. He became
an American citizen in 1959, and one year later accepted an offer
to return to the Courant Institute as a professor. In 1967, Moser
took over the directorship of the institute, serving three years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, he accepted the position in Zurich. He retired in 1995,
the year he received the Wolf Prize for mathematics. He also served
as president of the International Mathematical Union from 1983 to
1986..
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, a son, Richard D. Emery of New York;
two daughters, Nina S. Moser of Seattle and Lucy I. Moser of Dijon,
France; a brother, Klaus Moser-Maync of New York, and seven
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Nirenberg, a mathematician at Courant, said of Moser's
work, ``His mathematics was beautiful.

DISCOVERY CREW PREPARES TO GRAB HUBBLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Discovery astronauts raced after the disabled Hubble Space
Telescope on Monday as they readied spacesuits, dozens of hand
tools and other equipment for a high-tech service call.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-man shuttle crew was on course to reach the
42-foot-long observatory late Tuesday. European Space Agency
astronaut Jean Francois Clervoy was to grab the observatory with
Discovery's 50-foot-long robot arm shortly before 8 p.m. EST. Once
nabbed, the towering observatory will be secured upright atop a
rotating work platform within the shuttle's cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   The delicate operation more than 360 miles above the Earth will
set the stage for a series of three long spacewalks this week by
astronauts Steve Smith, John Grunsfeld, Mike Foale and Claude
Nicollier to repair the Hubble's crippled pointing system and make
other repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's pursuit of the space telescope began Sunday night as
the shuttle soared into orbit from its Florida launching complex,
while the Hubble sailed high above Central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first shuttle launching since the late July liftoff
of Columbia was jeopardized by an electrical short. Later traced to
chaffed insulation in fuselage wiring, Columbia's short prompted
the space agency to suspend launchings while all of the winged
ships underwent extensive inspections and wiring repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Though the bulk of the eight-day mission lies ahead, NASA was
clearly pleased to see Discovery in orbit after a record nine
delays. The postponements spanned more than two months as shuttle
managers embraced a more cautious approach after the wiring
problems and called for additional scrutiny and repairs to a rocket
engine as well as to external cabling and Discovery's propulsion
and hydraulic systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back in business,'' mission control cabled Discovery
commander Curt Brown early Monday as the astronauts began their
first full day in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts spent most of the day preparing Discovery's robot
arm, the airlock, the spacesuits, and more than 300 hand tools for
tasks ahead. The tasks went smoothly, though one of the spacesuits
had a weak battery that was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the shuttle astronauts closed to within 1,200 miles
of the orbital observatory, and for the first time during their
flight maneuvered to slow rather than increase the closure rate.
</P>
<P>
   Working closely with NASA's mission control, Brown and pilot
Scott Kelly will increase the number of maneuvers Tuesday to refine
the rendezvous. When Discovery reaches a point 2,500 feet below the
telescope, Brown will began to manually steer the shuttle close
enough for Clervoy to grapple it.
</P>
<P>
   Celestial observations with the telescope ceased in mid-November
when the Hubble experienced its fourth gyro failure in two years.
The loss disabled the pointing system that permits ground-based
astronomers to aim the telescope at distant stars and galaxies for
lengthy observations.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Grunsfeld will address the gyro loss during the
mission's first spacewalk on Wednesday by replacing all six of the
devices.
</P>
<P>
   With that task complete, the spacewalkers plan to expend their
work by replacing the Hubble's flight computer; a data recorder and
transmitter that store stellar images of the celestial objects
studied by astronomers and relay them to Earth; and make other
improvements to the power and guidance systems. As time permits,
the spacewalkers are equipped to patch damage to the external
insulation of the observatory caused by solar radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we are pleased,'' NASA's Don McMonagle, Discovery's
mission management team chairman, said of the shuttle program's
change in fortune. ``We have a darn near perfect vehicle in orbit
right now. We couldn't ask for a better scenario to execute this
mission.''

LYLE LEVERICH, EXPERT ON TENNESSEE WILLIAMS, DIES AT 79  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif. )   By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lyle Leverich, who wrote ``Tom: The Unknown Tennessee
Williams,'' the prize-winning authorized biography of the
playwright, died on Friday at Kaiser Hospital in San Rafael, Calif.
He was 79 and lived in San Rafael.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart seizure after complications from diabetes,
said Herman Arrow, Leverich's friend and executor.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Albee praised Leverich's book as an ``extraordinary and
invaluable critical biography,'' and added, ``There are two people
in this world who are most instrumental in furthering Tennessee
Williams' reputation, and they are Tennessee Williams and Lyle
Leverich.'' Arthur Miller called the biography ``a rare work of the
greatest importance to American culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Leverich's book, which was published in 1995, covers the first
34 years of Williams' life, tracing the familial and emotional
sources of the playwright's creativity, delineating how he emerged
as one of the most important American artists of his century. The
biography ends in 1945 with the triumphant Broadway opening of
``The Glass Menagerie.''
</P>
<P>
   It was to be followed by ``Tenn: The Timeless World of Tennessee
Williams,'' which would cover the rest of the playwright's life and
would deal, said the author, with ``a man who couldn't handle his
success.'' He envisioned ``ending on an optimistic note _ I think
the late plays require that.'' Leverich had finished less than half
of the second book, Arrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became a biographer, Leverich had been a theatrical
producer and had scant background as a writer. He and Williams met
in 1976 when Leverich was producing Williams' ``Two-Character
Play'' at a small theater in San Francisco. They became friends and
two years later Leverich suggested that he write a book focusing on
Williams' work in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   That book was never finished, but the next year, when Williams
was presented with Kennedy Center honors in Washington, Leverich
was one of his guests at the ceremony. The playwright introduced
Leverich to his brother, Dakin, by saying, ``Lyle is writing my
biography.'' At first Leverich did not take the suggestion
seriously, but then agreed to go ahead with the project, at least
partly as an antidote to the insufficiency of the playwright's
``Memoirs,'' published in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had Williams' official approval and was a great
admirer of his work, Leverich always believed the book would not be
hagiographic but would tell the complete unvarnished story. He was
encouraged by Williams' advice to him: ``You can always say the old
hound dog could be a son of a bitch and you won't be wide of the
mark.''
</P>
<P>
   The biographer and his subject were in close contact until
Williams' death in 1983. When the book was finished, Lady Maria St.
Just, one of the trustees of the estate that controlled the
playwright's work, refused to let Leverich quote from Williams'
unpublished material. After her death in 1994 the book was
published. It received great acclaim, won the George Freedley Award
as the best theater book of the year and has come to be
acknowledged as the authoritative work on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Leverich, who was named Augustus Lyle Leverich Jr., was born in
Brooklyn. He is survived by a half-brother, Lyle Taylor Leverich of
Saratoga, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The author served in the Navy during World War II, and in 1945
saw Laurette Taylor in ``The Glass Menagerie'' during the play's
Chicago tryout. It was his first brush with Williams. As he said,
``If anyone told me that I'd be Tennessee's biographer, I would
have said, `You're mad.'''
</P>
<P>
   After an unsuccessful career writing stories and screenplays, he
opened a bookstore in Stinson Beach, near San Francisco, and then
moved into the theater as a producer. Tall and portly, he could
have been a stand-in for Big Daddy in Williams' ``Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof,'' but temperamentally was the opposite. The character was a
raging and corrosive patriarch; Leverich was known as a kindly and
sensitive gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   In his biography he wrote, ``With all his sins remembered,
Tennessee's overriding virtue was his fervent involvement with
life, in living it and in writing about it with passion.'' Leverich
followed that example while writing his book. Williams' motto was
``en avant,'' which his biographer readily adopted: resisting
discouragement, he was always moving onward.

MORGAN STANLEY EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS WITH RECORD OPERATING PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. reported record quarterly
income of $1.63 billion Monday, up 86 percent from its operating
profit a year earlier and well ahead of analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   In the first look at fourth quarter results from a major Wall
Street securities firm, the company said it earned $2.84 a diluted
share. The profit was up from $1.49 a share a year earlier, when
its operating income totaled $879 million, and was well ahead of
the $1.96 a share expected by analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to argue with anything that they posted,'' said
Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group. ``It's a
blowout quarter.'' Strauss raised his estimate of Morgan Stanley's
earnings 20 percent last month, to $2.10 a share, only to be topped
by 35 percent. Monday, he raised his estimate for the firm's 2000
earnings to $9.10 from $8.15 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley also announced that in January it would split its
shares two for one and increase its dividend, before the split, by
67 percent, to 40 cents a share. The firm said it planned to spend
up to $1 billion buying back its stock. Its shares rose $1.4375, to
$129.50.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley, like rival investment bank Goldman Sachs, which
reports its earnings Tuesday, is riding atop two powerful trends: a
boom in new stock offerings, especially by Internet-based
companies, and a wave of mergers and acquisitions involving
European companies. Morgan Stanley ranks just behind Goldman this
year in money raised through initial public offerings and in the
value of announced mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IPO boom certainly plays an important role in the results
of the quarter,'' said Robert Scott, Morgan Stanley's chief
financial officer. ``We also had a record quarter in M&AMP;A with lots
of activity in the U.S. and in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said high levels of trading, especially stock trading, led
to a 36 percent increase in commission revenue, to $786 million
from $579 million in a depressed quarter a year earlier. Over all,
the firm's profit from its securities businesses more than doubled
to $1.39 billion in the quarter that ended Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's 43 percent jump in revenue, to $5.66 billion for the
quarter, surprised even the firm's management, analysts said. That
was clear, they said, from how much the firm's compensation
expenses shrunk.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley set aside almost $1 billion less in employee
compensation and benefits last quarter than the quarter before.
Scott said the decrease was a result of the firm's practice of
accruing money through the year to pay year-end bonuses. Those
bonuses, which account for the bulk of annual pay for investment
bankers and traders, will be paid in early January.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Morgan Stanley and its competitors pay about half
of their revenues to their employees as salaries, bonuses and
benefits. But, Scott said, Morgan Stanley had such a big year that
it needed only 23 percent of this quarter's revenue _ 40 percent of
the full year's revenue _ to pay competitive bonuses this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had such a stupendous year, if they had paid out 49
percent of this year's revenue, it would clearly argue that the
business doesn't have economies of scale,'' said Joan Solotar, an
analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Solotar said the markets gained strength well into December,
confounding most industry insiders, who thought investors would

weren't bearish thought it would be significantly slower,'' she
said. ``But money is still flowing into the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's expenses aside from compensation were higher
last quarter, Strauss said. He said some of the increase went
toward technology and marketing for the firm's new iChoice online
trading operation.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said it was too soon to gauge the success of iChoice, but
he said the firm was pleased that of the online accounts opened
since the October introduction, 70 percent were for new customers
and only 30 percent were transfers from the firm's traditional
brokerage operation.

EDWARD DORN, WRITER ON THE AMERICAN WEST, DIES AT 70  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Dorn, an author known for the mock-epic poem
``Gunslinger'' and other writings about the American West, died on
Dec. 10 at his home in Denver. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Tom Clark, a poet and
poetry critic.
</P>
<P>
   Dorn defined himself as ``a poet of the West _ not by nativity
but by orientation.'' Reviewing his ``Collected Poems 1956-1974''
in The New York Times Book Review, Bill Zavatsky wrote, ``Dorn's
poetic strength has rested not on the `dazzle of learning' he
admits to loving but on his capacity to feel with language the
lives and the life of the land he knows best.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorn wrote ``Gunslinger'' over a period of years. It appeared
first in a succession of small-press volumes beginning in 1968 and
later in a single-volume, 200-page edition (1989). The poem earned
Dorn a following in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years Dorn was much concerned, in his writing and
teaching, with the culture and geography of the West. His writings
on the subject are collected in ``Way West: Stories, Essays and
Verse Accounts 1963-1993'' (1993).
</P>
<P>
   Dorn was born in Villa Grove, Ill., studied at the University of
Illinois at Urbana as well as at Black Mountain College, and taught
in the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   His 1951 marriage to Helene Buck ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Jennifer; two sons, Paul Buck of
Carver, Mass., and Kidd Dorn of Manhattan; a daughter, Maya Dorn of
Boston; two stepchildren from his first marriage, Fred Buck of
Gloucester, Mass., and Chansonette Buck, who lives in California; a
sister, Nonna Lytle of Arcola, Ill.; a brother, David Abercrombie
of Lebanon, Tenn.; and two grandsons.

6 CUBANS DEPORTED IN WAKE OF JAIL STANDOFF; 7TH IS HELD FOR RAPE
INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
 LD-WRITETHRU-NYT  (Eds.: Complete writethru and update.) 
(ms) 
 By PHILIP SHENON with DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six of seven Cuban inmates involved in a hostage
standoff last week in Louisiana were flown back to Cuba Monday over
the protests of state prosecutors who say the men should have been
put on trial for kidnapping, Clinton administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh remained in the United States as federal officials
investigated accusations that he had raped a female prisoner taken
hostage in the standoff at the Louisiana jail. He also has not
completed sentences for two recent convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The other Cuban inmates were taken in heavily guarded
Immigration and Naturalization Service vans to an airport in
Alexandria, La., and placed aboard a government jet for the flight
to Cuba. They arrived in Havana about 6:20 Monday evening, The
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   While the agreement drew criticism from Louisiana authorities as
inviting similar situations at other prisons, Clinton
administration officials insisted that the unusual accord with the
government of Fidel Castro allowing the men to be returned to Cuba
after they freed the hostages did not represent a significant
advance in Cuban-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, they said, was there any tie between this agreement and any
possible settlement of another immigration case, that of a
6-year-old Cuban boy who was rescued from the Atlantic Ocean off
Florida last month and who has become the subject of an highly
publicized international child-custody battle. The Castro
government has demanded the return of the boy, Elian Gonzalez,
whose mother and step-father drowned in their effort to reach the
United States in a crowded boat.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service has recently sent signals that it
intends to send Elian home to his father in Cuba over the
objections of his Cuban-American relatives and of powerful
Cuban-American political leaders in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   James Foley, a state department spokesman, was asked at a news
conference Monday if there was any link between the two cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Foley replied.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Cuban inmates deported Monday were ``being returned
to Cuba at their request, and the government of Cuba has agreed to
accept them. We believe this resolution is in the best interests of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Other administration officials said they believed that Castro
had agreed to accept the inmates back in Cuba partly in hope of
improving his image with the American public. ``He can say he's the
man who prevented this hostage drama from turning into a tragedy,''
said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban inmates involved in the hostage standoff last week had
completed prison sentences for crimes committed in the United
States but were being held indefinitely because their deportation _
the usual procedure for felons who are not American citizens _ had
been blocked by the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   All had arrived here in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, during which
Castro sent thousands of criminals to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached on Saturday allowing the seven inmates to
return to Cuba outraged prosecutors in St. Martin Parish, where the
prison is.
</P>
<P>
   J. Phil Haney, the first assistant district attorney for the
parish, called the agreement an unwelcome surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not seen fit to talk to us about this,'' Haney said
of the Clinton administration. ``We still haven't been officially
notified that anyone is going to Cuba, even though we made known
our wishes to prosecute and maintain custody of the people
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the siege, he said, the seven Cubans should have
been tried in Louisiana on charges of aggravated kidnapping, which
carries a mandatory life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Haney said he was particularly angry at the thought that the
prisoner who remained behind, Roberto Villar-Gana, might eventually
go free in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the rape accusation, Villar-Gana was recently
convicted in Cameron, La., of the attempted murder of a police
officer and of distributing cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made it clear to INS that Villar was not a Cuban
detainee in the sense that all of the others were,'' Haney said,
using the initials for the immigration service. ``We were assured
by the INS that he would not be handled like the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they had little information about the
rape accusation against Villar-Gana, whose mother acted as an
intermediary between the hostage-takers and the justice department.
</P>
<P>
   Several hostages taken by the Cubans were female inmates, and
federal officials said one had accused Villar-Gana of sexually
assaulting her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we have to investigate the rape charges before we
even consider sending him back,'' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Villar-Gana's mother, Mercedes Villar, who first
disclosed the deal last weekend. She told reporters that she had
seen a written agreement guaranteeing safe passage for her son and
the other inmates to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Haney of the prosecutor's office said that he welcomed the
release of the hostages taken during the six-day standoff but that
it was wrong for the government to promise the hostage-takers free
passage out of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's ever a circumstance where you want to
make this kind of offer as part of negotiation, especially when
they've taken hostages in a penal institution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It subjects every penal institution in the United States to
the situation where, if you bargain with someone, you know you'll
get what you're asking for,'' Haney said. ``It just invites these
situations to take place.''

LA TIMES PUBLISHES PROFIT-SHARING DEAL WITH STAPLES CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times published an unsparing account on Monday
of its ill-fated profit-sharing deal on a Sunday magazine section
with a local sports arena, the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was written by David Shaw, media reporter for
The newspaper, and published in a 14-page special section, detailed
the deal's incremental evolution, the haphazard way editors
realized what was happening and the failure of the newsroom's
leadership to quash it.
</P>
<P>
   The extensive coverage, which was edited by a former managing
editor of the paper but not reviewed by the paper's current top
editors before publication, reveals some moments of high drama at
the height of the controversy in late October and early November.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the drama and the detail, and the light the report
shines on some of the murkiest moments of the affair, ``There is no
smoking gun in this piece,'' said Narda Zacchino, an associate
editor at The Times. ``I'm not sure people really expected a
smoking gun.''
</P>
<P>
   The firestorm that erupted in The Times' newsroom after it was
disclosed that The Times and the Staples Center had split the
profits from the magazine _ $600,000, acccording to Shaw _ was
borne of the traditional tension between the newspaper's two roles.
</P>
<P>
   As a business enterprise, a newspaper is supposed to make a
profit. As a journalistic enterprise, it is suppose to report the
facts regardless of who is offended. Its journalistic independence
and the trust that inspires are vital.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists who rebelled over the deal argued _ and the
publisher and many protesting readers agreed _ that to share the
profits of its journalism with the subject of that journalism gave
readers reason to doubt the newspaper's objectivity and integrity,
even though the journalists involved had not known of the deal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shaw documented cultural changes that were a byproduct of the
desire of Mark H. Willes, the chief executive of the Times Mirror
Co., the newspaper's parent and for more than 18 months the
publisher of the newspaper, to reinvent the newspaper, eliminating
traditional barriers between business executives and journalists _
barriers designed to protect the integrity of the news product from
advertiser influence.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, The Times published a front-page apology for the
Staples Center deal, along with a statement of the ``Principles of
The Los Angeles Times,'' including one reading, ``We will show no
favoritism. Our newsroom will operate free of influence from public
and private institutions, political officials and advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Shaw's report said, had not always been the case in recent
months. In some other arrangements advertising executives tried to
guarantee coverage of certain events, or suggested that the books
of publishers with large advertising budgets be given special
attention in the newspaper's book review.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story shows in great detail that when people had concerns
about breaking down a wall (between advertising and editorial
content), this was not just a theory, there was reality to this
fear,'' said Henry Weinstein, a legal affairs reporter who was one
of the most outspoken critics of the Staples Center deal.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to some of the report's revelations about other deals,
he said it presented ``a distressing picture of a situation where
business considerations had improperly encroached on journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Staples Center deal, in its embryonic phase, had little to
do with journalism. On Dec. 17, 1998, after months of negotiation,
The Times agreed to be one of the ``founding partners'' of the
center. The agreement, Shaw wrote, committed the newspaper ``to pay
Staples Center about $1.6 million a year for five years _ $800,000
of that in cash, $500,000 in free advertising and an estimated
$300,000 in profits'' from what the contract described as ``joint
revenue opportunities'' _ such as a special magazine to be
published when the center opened.
</P>
<P>
   Although two managing editors, at meetings in March, objected to
devoting the magazine to the arena's opening, Michael Parks, the
paper's editor, later overruled them _ although, he said, he was
never told by the publisher, Kathryn M. Downing, that the magazine
would be used as a ``joint revenue opportunity.'' Ms. Downing has
consistently agreed with his recollection.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said that he became aware of the deal at a Sept. 14
meeting, as final preparations were being made to print the
magazine, which was issued.
</P>
<P>
   His account is confirmed by Ms. Downing but not by several other
participants. (Parks' account of what he said during an interview
with The New York Times is also contradicted by this reporter in
the Shaw report.)
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor Ms. Downing, however, took steps to not publish
the magazine or give readers notice of the profit-sharing
arrangement with the subject of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy that we've had this'' special section, Ms. Zacchino
said. ``I'm not sure that this is closure. I'm not sure when
closure will come. But I do feel this is a very, very important
step toward closure.'' The Shaw report, she said, was ``very
thorough and exhaustive and tough.''
</P>
<P>
   In late November and early December, however, Ms. Downing has
made two costly decisions to shred sections of the newspaper
containing unlabeled advertising material. The statement of
principles published Sunday, which was being prepared at the time,
says, ``We hold that journalistic excellence is the soundest
foundation for our success and that the editorial integrity of The
Los Angeles Times is its most precious asset.''

SINGAPORE AIRLINES BUYS 49 PERCENT STAKE IN VIRGIN AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Richard Branson, the British entrepreneur who started
Virgin Airlines 15 years ago with a single jumbo jet flight across
the Atlantic, sold nearly half his business Monday to Singapore
Airlines for $965 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of a 49 percent stake gives Branson a highly profitable
partner at a time when his airline is in a heated battle with
British Airways for trans-Atlantic passengers, Virgin's most
important business.
</P>
<P>
   It also will greatly expand the European reach of Singapore
Airlines, which is known for the quality of its service. In effect,
the deal gives Branson's airline an instant global reach.
</P>
<P>
   Branson said the airlines had ``sort of courted each other'' for
12 years. Virgin's London-New York service started with a lone
jumbo jet in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal has avoided leaving us out in the cold,'' he said,
referring to the new alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant benefit for the Asian airline is access to
Heathrow in London, Europe's busiest airport, which will allow it
to fly trans-Atlantic routes.
</P>
<P>
   While Singapore Airlines will not be able to fly directly
between Britain and the United States with its own planes, it will
be able to book the routes as Singapore flights in a code-sharing
program with Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   The deal means that Virgin and Singapore will control 2.5
percent of Heathrow's available slots, or available daily takeoff
and landing opportunities. By law, an airline cannot sell a stake
of more than 49 percent without forfeiting its nationality and its
rights under international route agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is the latest in a series of international alliances in
the airline industry that give participating carriers integrated
route schedules and timetables.
</P>
<P>
   Branson said, however, that Virgin would not enter the much
broader Star Alliance, which Singapore is expected to enter in the
spring. That arrangement, led by United Airlines and Lufthansa,
enables several international carriers to coordinate schedules and
ticketing.
</P>
<P>
   Branson and Cheong Choong Kong, chief executive of Singapore
Airlines, said at a news conference here Monday that the deal came
together during lunch on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After morning negotiations, Branson and Cheong both adjourned
for lunch at the same restaurant in the Four Seasons Hotel. As
Choong told it, he was eating when Branson walked over and passed
him a handwritten note on scrap paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two sentences on it,'' Choong said. ``The first
indicated strongly that we could strike a deal; the second was a
question: Who is paying for lunch?''
</P>
<P>
   Choong added, ``I was so excited about the first sentence that I
forgot the question.'' He said he owes Branson lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal would benefit both companies. ``It puts
Singapore Airlines in a great position and is a tremendous price
for Virgin to get,'' said Chris Tarry, an analyst at Commerzbank in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines has been trying to make an acquisition since
it unwound an alliance with Swissair and Delta Air Lines by selling
its stakes in the two carriers for $526.1 million. Even though it
has $3.07 billion in cash, it made two unsuccessful attempts to
take stakes in South African Airways and Ansett Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines also recently expressed interest in buying a
stake in Thai Airways International.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Virgin's domestic rival, British Airways, fell 4.8
percent Monday, as investors worried that the deal would mean an
increase in competition on North Atlantic routes, which industry
executives already say have too many planes.

HIGH SCHOOL GIVES BEAUTY LESSONS TO SENIOR CITIZENS IN THE SOUTH
BRONX  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In her 1992 book, ``The Change,'' Germaine Greer
famously counseled women against Cher-like acts of age defiance.
Women should use their later years, she maintained, finally to
break free from the ``fretful struggle'' always to look good.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the kind of feminist thinking that probably doesn't
sit well with Joyce Cox, who spent Friday morning in a crushed
velvet jacket getting silver feathers etched onto her pearlized,
paper-clip-length nails and talking about her recent turn as a sort
of advanced-age Gisele.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cox, a retired mail-room worker, had modeled a handkerchief
skirt at a fashion show held at the Hope of Israel social center in
the Bronx a few weeks earlier. ``Guess how old I am?'' she asked.
``Guess,'' she prodded, before pre-empting with the answer.
``Sixty-nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cox, along with about 58 other women, were getting
manicured, pedicured and plucked in the classrooms of the Jane
Addams Vocational High School in the South Bronx, whose cosmetology
students each year offer makeovers to neighbors who generally
exceed the age of the average ``Dawson's Creek'' viewer by about 55
years.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Addams, which was founded in 1934, has 1,600 teen-agers
enrolled. About 300 wear white smocks every day, balancing course
work called Beauty 3 or Beauty 4 with course work called English or
algebra. They hunch over plastic heads with penned grids on the
scalps, learning to layer hair and finger wave and box braid it in
classrooms that make few concessions to modernity, save for a
Christy Turlington photo on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that male vanity is not the sole province of Maxim
magazine's readership, Charles Estridge, the only male client at
the event, said he has been coming to Jane Addams for beauty
treatments for years. While getting a manicure on Friday, he said
he was most looking forward to his facial. Estridge had just turned
80.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use two creams, an emollient, a mask and an astringent,''
said a student who was tending to Estridge's nail filing and was
about to begin his skin care. ``People come out with a glow.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Isabel, another student, said, ``I like better blow-drying
and hair coloring,'' referring to the beauty curriculum. Ms. Isabel
came to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1992.
Until two years ago she spoke no English; now, she is a member of
the National Honor Society and plans to apply to college next year.
</P>
<P>
   However dramatically money and celebrity have attached
themselves to some in the business of making people look more
attractive, Ms. Isabel and her friends generally aspire to jobs
traditionally accorded more status, rather than becoming the next
Frederic Fekkai.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a manager in any type of business,'' Tenisha
Artis, a 12th grader, said. ``I just wanted something to fall back
on after I go to college,'' she said of styling.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior said, ``It's nothing to make a future with.'' An
11th grader, Valene Benjamin, said she did think of opening a salon
one day, but her more immediate goals included getting into the
University of Connecticut, studying accounting and playing
professional basketball.
</P>
<P>
   This is not welcome news to the beauty industry, which is
suffering from a labor shortage that Ray Testa, president of the
American Association of Cosmetology Schools, described as brutal.
Testa estimated that there are about 1,000 beauty schools in the
country, half the number that existed in the 1980's. In Manhattan,
Testa said, there are just two beauty schools left.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Coniglio, head of the International Chain Salon Association,
a trade group, conceded that ``a lot of people don't look at
cosmetology as a viable profession,'' despite the fact that the
number of Americans getting their hair cut in salons is at an
all-time high, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Some graduates of Jane Addams go to work in places like Vidal
Sassoon and Tear Drops of Elegance, a beauty parlor in Harlem.
Upscale salons like John Barrett and Stephen Knoll in Manhattan
have not tapped into the talent pool there. Their graduates, they
say, come mostly from the Long Island Beauty School. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A HANDSHAKE REFUSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Dec. 21: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore may have won the battle of the headlines
by offering to debate former Sen. Bill Bradley twice a week and
refrain from television ads during the primary season. But Bradley,
who responded to Gore's offer of an on-air handshake with amused
disdain on ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday, had sound tactical reasons
for rejecting the suggestion. Debates are healthy and enlightening,
and the Democratic contenders' two televised encounters over the
weekend showed the strengths and weaknesses of both. But there is
no reason to insist that Bradley, a challenger who is much less
well known than Gore, give up a crucial avenue to communicate with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Meet the Press'' encounter was by far the liveliest of all
the presidential candidates' exchanges so far. But even Tim Russert
found it hard to keep the candidates from confusing viewers with
their intense squabbling over the arcane history of school vouchers
and the fiscal details of health care policy. Perhaps more
memorable than any particular points scored was the barrage of
comments like ``No! No! No!'' ``That's false!'' and ``Give me a
break!'' In his closing statement, Bradley said aptly that he and
the vice president represented ``different styles of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   They also bring very different strategic plans to their
confrontations. Bradley clearly believes he gains by casting
himself as a big-picture visionary who resists political games. For
his part, Gore seems convinced that he wins by pressing Bradley on
policy details and outpointing him on the debate scorecard.
Controlling the content has become a battle of wills between the
two. Bradley seems to have the upper hand when the exchanges are
thematic, Gore when they are about the history and funding of
specific programs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bradley have been thrown on the defensive more
than once in their debates. The former New Jersey senator is
probably going to have to do better than swat away challenges about
how his budget numbers add up, particularly on health care. Gore
looks weakest when called upon to defend the fund-raising abuses of
the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign and his assertion that Clinton would
be remembered as one of the nation's greatest presidents. Both are
going to have to do better in candidly discussing reforms in Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   With the holidays approaching, it is possible now to assess the
debate performances of all Republican and Democratic candidates. It
must be said that for all their differences, Gore and Bradley gave
intense demonstrations of their knowledge and interest in
education, health care and budget issues, whereas the Republicans
have drifted off too often into generalities over reducing
government and abortion. Unlike Gore and Bradley, Sen. John McCain
and Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runners, have yet to
get into any serious arguments except for campaign finance reform.
They may find themselves ill prepared when it comes time for them
to face either of the two Democrats in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this season there have been two types of debates
among the candidates. In one popular setting, the so-called
town-meeting format, the questions are asked by regular voters who
sometimes cut through the policy verbiage but sometimes digress
into self-indulgent tangents. The other format has been to turn the
debate over to a star network correspondent like Russert, Ted
Koppel or Tom Brokaw, creating the odd effect of the politicians
competing with someone who is a bigger star than they.
</P>
<P>
   More experimentation might be in order when the campaign resumes
next year. Why not try something like the old-fashioned debate,
with the format left up to the candidates themselves, volleying
back and forth with statements and questions? Gore was right to say
that more debates would be better for the public. It would also
facilitate understanding to make the television time available
free. There is a role for television ads and stump speeches, but
there is no substitute for give-and-take among candidates
emphasizing their differences with each other. That is what a
political campaign is supposed to be. &QL;

FORMER IRS OFFICIAL ALLEGES FAVORITISM FOR THE WELL-CONNECTED
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Adds comments from Al Davis' spokesman and tax attorney.) 
(jw) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The top Internal Revenue Service official here
repeatedly gave wealthy and politically connected taxpayers
unwarranted breaks including reduced tax bills, a refund and
deferred payments in 1996 and 1997, the government's former chief
tax collector for the district testified Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Coons, tax collection chief for Northern California from
1995 until he was removed in February 1998, testified at a hearing
where he is trying to get his job back under a federal law that
protects whistle-blowers.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS contends that Coons was dismissed for looking at 253 Web
sites on his government computer, most of them travel or stock
market sites, but five of them featuring images of naked women. It
also says he initially lied to investigators about this.
</P>
<P>
   Coons, 55, has acknowledged some ``stupid'' misuse of the
computer, but says the charges are a smoke screen to obscure the
real reason for his removal. He says he stood in the way of a
pattern of favoritism for the wealthy, especially those represented
by former IRS executives and federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   No names of taxpayers were mentioned in Monday's testimony
before an administrative law judge for the Merit Systems Protection
Board, Phillip Reed. But records in the case show that the
taxpayers to whom Coons is referring include Al Davis, owner of the
Oakland Raiders football team; members of the Alioto family, whose
patriarch was mayor here in the 1960s; and a diamond company,
Golden ADA, which the federal government says was a Russian
diamond-for-cash money-laundering operation.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Alioto Jr. said that his family had a years-long dispute
with the IRS that included the sale of one brother's home and the
seizure of his mother's car, but that ``we never sought any special
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Davis, Amy Trask, said ``neither Mr. Davis or
the Oakland Raiders received or sought special treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We only asked for fairness and civility,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Lipton, Davis' tax lawyer, said he could not imagine any
reason to remove Coons from his post over the tax dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Coons said that in the Russian money-laundering case, he was
repeatedly urged to back off both by representatives of the company
and by federal prosecutors, the State Department and Russian
officials.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he complained repeatedly to Robert Ah Nee, the IRS
district director here, about these and other actions he considered
improper, but that Ah Nee just shrugged and said nothing. Coons
said one taxpayer who owed millions of dollars and had substantial
income received a major tax break, over his objections, to Ah Nee _
partly by threatening to go to the Senate Finance Committee, which
at the time was investigating the IRS. Public records show that the
testimony concerned Davis' tax case.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview earlier, Coons said that Ah Nee and his deputy,
Peggy Rule, told him not to enforce collections in another case
because seizing a mansion and selling it would ``create bad
publicity for the IRS, and we don't need that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them it would make every working stiff see that we
treated the rich the same way we treat them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that after this, the two officials cooled toward him.
</P>
<P>
   Coons said subordinates, in another case, brought him two years
of tax returns and a refund check for nearly $100,000, saying that
Ah Nee had personally ordered the check be issued. The subordinates
told Coons that they regarded the returns as fraudulent. Coons said
he went to Ah Nee to complain, but was told that his opinion did
not matter and that the issuing of the check would be delegated to
another official.
</P>
<P>
   An IRS lawyer, Richard Slizeski, through questioning of
witnesses Monday and Friday, sought to portray Coons as an
opportunist who, only after he was caught misusing his computer,
tried to refashion a series of routine disagreements into something
more.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Jensen, the IRS executive who demoted Coons in August,
testified that he regarded him as a whistle-blower, but that the
misuse of his computer and his denials were so serious that it left
him with no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   Reed refused to allow testimony by Frank Miceli, the IRS
compliance chief in the Western region. Mary Dryovage, Coons'
lawyer, wanted Miceli to testify that any punishment greater than a
two-week suspension was unwarranted and to discuss Coons' track
record as one of the most highly regarded executives in the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Although Coons has been dismissed as chief tax collector in
Northern California, he still collects money for the IRS _ for the
federal charity drive.

PLAYING THE FIELD FOR THE BEST CELLPHONE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Imelda Marcos picking out yet another pair of shoes.
Patricia Duff running through five teams of divorce lawyers. Donald
Trump and his succession of leggy blondes. In the annals of the
fickle, some people are giants.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, even among ordinary mortals, there has never been a
shortage of caprice, whether in matters of the heart or the head,
or in these modern times, matters close to the ear and the lips.
That is to say, telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, countless people jilt their phone companies and then
embrace another in a kind of mating ritual that makes marketing
executives stare at their ceilings at night. There are usually few
warning signs before the split. It's not as if most callers can
complain of egregious lapses like being cut off in midsentence.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after years of being stuck with one or two choices,
telephone customers have suddenly become the belles of the ball.
They are courted by dozens of phone companies, each dangling
enticements like free calling time, frequent-flier miles and $100
checks that come unsolicited in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of game that you play,'' said Ninon Rogers, 27, an
actress in Greenwich Village who has switched phone companies five
times in five years. ``It is worth it because you get the same
service for less money _ and sometimes outright cash.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick glance at Ms. Rogers' dance card: She signed up with
Sprint in 1995, but was lured away by a $100 check from AT&AMP;T. In
1997, she bit at MCI's offer of 3,000 frequent-flier miles on
Continental Airlines, but then settled again for Sprint because the
international rates were lower. Last year, she was wooed back to
AT&AMP;T with the 10 cents-a-minute plan for domestic calls.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rogers is just the sort of disloyal customer who has helped
stimulate a fierce competition in the telecommunications industry
and drive the cost of phone calls down to just a few pennies per
minute. A recent marketing survey of 12,185 households by J.D.
Power &AMP; Associates showed that 31 percent switched their
long-distance service at least once this year compared with 26
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the industry has created its own monster because
companies keep topping each other,'' said Kirk Parsons, director of
telecommunications accounts at J.D. Power. ``Brand loyalty doesn't
matter any more; what drives the consumer is cost. The way the rate
is going down, in a couple of years, long distance is going to be
free.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. But in this freewheeling buyer's market for
telephone service, New Yorkers seeking to play the field have never
had so many suitors _ or so many tangled offers that seem to
promise one thing and turn out to be quite another.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, AT&AMP;T, MCI Worldcom, Sprint and a host of
upstart companies have leased local lines from Bell Atlantic and
started offering what is basically the same service. They have
dangled sign-up bonuses like two free hours every month for six
months (AT&AMP;T), a three-hour phone card picturing two cuddly polar
bears (MCI Worldcom), frequent-flier miles and a $10 credit at
Radio Shack stores (Sprint).
</P>
<P>
   They have pursued new customers in unlikely places. At the New
York City Marathon last month, Sprint banners heralded an unlimited
local calling plan while workers passed out cellular phones for
runners to make free calls. A local competitor, Z-Line, gave out
key chains and glossy cards that read, ``Rudy. Hillary. Z-Line. New
Yorkers love a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site Priceline.com, after letting customers name a price
for airline tickets, hotel rooms and groceries, plans to do the
same thing early next year for long-distance rates. Customers will
be able to buy blocks of time from companies willing to match their
bids.
</P>
<P>
   But all these options leave some consumers simply flustered.
They complain that calling plans are convoluted and seem to benefit
those who scramble for the best deal rather than those who stand by
their plan. Slick advertising campaigns leave out crucial details
like monthly fees and restrictions on calling times.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are busy, and the phone companies take advantage,''
said Cindy McIntyre, publisher of The Frugal Gazette in Newtown,
Conn., who advises her readers to call the phone companies every
six months for the latest offers.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jules Polonetsky, the commissioner of consumer affairs for
New York City, seemed baffled by it all. He spent 45 minutes last
month comparing his phone plan with half a dozen others before
throwing up his hands. ``It's more complicated than applying for a
mortgage,'' Polonetsky declared, after ending up where he started:
with his current company, Excel.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are just looking for a down-to-earth relationship
with their phone company, but that is increasingly hard to find.
Lawrence Whiteside, 63, a building consultant in Clinton Hill,
Brooklyn, was nearly persuaded to switch by a letter from AT&AMP;T that
promised 75 hours of local calling and 7 cents a minute for
long-distance calls, all for $24.90 a month. He had to call the
company to find out that phone charges were rounded up to the next
minute and that his fax line would cost extra. ``I don't want to
spend half an hour going through a bill,'' Whiteside said. ``That's
too much like work.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like Whiteside, most phone customers stay faithful to the
company they know, if only because switching seems like too much
trouble. For instance, Judy Langer, 58, a focus-group moderator in
Manhattan, routinely ducks calls from telemarketers. ``I'm not a
comparison shopper,'' said Ms. Langer, who spends about $50 a month
with MCI Worldcom. ``It's a relatively minor expense, and we've
been satisfied with the quality of service.
</P>
<P>
   But an increasing number of people, either because they have
more time, or less money, or both, are on the prowl for better
deals. They scour the mail for the latest offers and compare notes
with their friends. Several self-styled phone experts have even set
up Web sites comparing pricing plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Sayers, an advertising sales manager from Martinez, Calif.,
runs 10-10phonerates.com _ a Web site he created last May to
compare 10-10 dial-in numbers that charge by the call without
requiring a monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some bargain hunters can be downright bashful about their
obsession. John Williams, 32, switched from AT&AMP;T to MCI Worldcom in
October after calculating that he would save $10 a month, or $120 a
year. But he hesitates to brag about it for fear that he will sound
like a ``cheap date.''
</P>
<P>
   Others offer no apologies for their love-'em-and-leave-'em
attitude toward phone service. Arlene Burgos, 27, a lawyer in
Manhattan, said she saved hundreds of dollars by switching phone
companies every six months in law school, raking in $100 checks and
ever-lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Ms. Rogers, the actress, has been quarreling with AT&AMP;T
over the $4.95 monthly fee for her discount rate. When she
complains, the company removes it from her bill to keep her from
leaving. Several months later, the fee will quietly reappear. Then
she picks up the phone again.
</P>
<P>
   When the day comes that AT&AMP;T refuses to drop the charge, she
knows she will have to make good on her threat. ``Ultimately, the
reason I'd be switching is to switch back to AT&AMP;T at a later
date,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Spurned companies, Ms. Rogers confided, always offer the best
deals.

FIRE DESTROYS PALATIAL HOME ONCE OWNED BY MARIAH CAREY  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.Y. _ When the singer Mariah Carey and Tommy Mottola,
the chairman of Sony Music Entertainment, moved into their
22,000-square-foot house that was built here in 1993, it was
described with nothing but superlatives.
</P>
<P>
   It was the biggest house imaginable, people in town said, with
the fanciest recording studio, the prettiest ballroom, the deepest
man-made pond and the oddest indoor shooting range. When the couple
divorced and sold the house to a neighbor in 1997, the red brick
Georgian mansion set a new record: at $20 million, it became the
most expensive house sale in Westchester County history. Now the
house has set its last record. It burned to the ground early
Saturday morning, leaving rubble and debris in place of luxury, and
became what is believed to be the most expensive private house fire
on record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in the past few years would you even have homes that
would approach $20 million,'' said Steven Goldstein, a spokesman
for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry association.
``There have always been manor houses, but only recently have we
seen the drastic increase in land value and the building of these
gargantuan homes. It appears to be the most expensive single family
home fire ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The next most expensive private home fire was in 1998, when a $7
million, 9,000-square-foot home burned to the ground in California,
Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire on Saturday has not been determined, said
Richard T. Hooker, second assistant chief of the Mount Kisco
Volunteer Fire Department. The house was under renovation and
vacant when two security guards in a separate house on the 50-acre
estate smelled smoke, heard an alarm and saw flames shooting out of
a second-story window. They called the Fire Department about 1:15
a.m. on Saturday, but flames had already engulfed the house when
the first engines got to the wooded hilltop estate, Chief Hooker
said. More than 125 firefighters from six departments fought the
blaze for the next several hours, but piles of debris were all that
remained of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to have to go through layer and layer of debris
before they can determine the cause of the fire,'' Hooker said.
``Nothing has been ruled out.''
</P>
<P>
   The home's new owners, Nelson and Claudia Peltz, had not planned
to move in until next year, their lawyer, Neale M. Albert, said.
Peltz, the chairman and chief executive of Triarc Cos., which owns
Snapple Beverages, the Arby's fast-food chain and Royal Crown Cola,
and his wife live in a home that sits on a 106-acre estate next to
the house that burned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They poured a lot of their thinking and emotion and energy
into that house,'' Albert said of the Peltzes. ``They are extremely
sad. When they bought the house, it was built for a couple, and the
Peltzes have six children, so they needed to do extensive
renovations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peltzes have wrangled with town officials in the past over
their private helicopter, which Peltz uses to commute to Manhattan,
40 miles away. The Town of Bedford is suing the couple in State
Supreme Court saying they are violating an ordinance banning
landings and takeoffs of private aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Peltzes say they should be allowed to use their Sikorsky
six-seater helicopter because private airplanes were used on the
property by its previous owners, and there was a hangar on the
property when they bought it.

RAPTORS' CARTER IS AN NBA ACROBAT WITH FEET ON THE GROUND
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Dell Curry rifled the inbound pass from halfcourt, a
bullet that careered off the right side of the backboard. The ball
looked awfully misguided until Vince Carter, the Toronto Raptors'
spectacular forward, came streaking in from the right wing,
perfectly timing and catching the ricochet. Spectators in the Air
Canada Center looked on in awe as he tried to cradle it between his
right palm and wrist _ before losing the ball, and his most recent
chance at video immortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince is making stuff up in midair,''' Kobe Bryant said
Sunday. ``I asked him afterward what he was thinking. He just
laughed. Catching a halfcourt pass off the glass and dunking?
That's crazy stuff. I haven't even tried that one yet.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a new prince in the National Basketball Association's
young acrobats club. He is 22 years old and 6 feet 6 inches tall
and spends much of his work life above the rim. He pirouetted 360
degrees last season and helicopter-dunked, but that's almost passe
now, outmoded by an assortment of windmills and lean-ins. As the
hyperbole and the highlights grow, so, too, do Carter's chances of
making the United States team for next year's Olympic Games as a
12th man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' inquired John Salley, the veteran Lakers forward.
``He's already one of the top five talents in the league. Everyone
knows it. They just don't want to tell him yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter managed a rueful smile when he heard of the compliments,
moments after the Raptors lost their third straight game and as
Toronto prepared to play host to the Nets on Tuesday night before
traveling to Madison Square Garden on Wednesday to face the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   He had just got caught up in a little egocentric game of
one-on-one with Bryant, another young flier who the National
Basketball Association is hoping will fill the post-Jordan void.
After the game ended, the two hugged as if they had just finished a
soft-drink commercial rather than a one-sided contest won by the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it is easy to forget that Carter's main job is seeing
that Toronto keeps winning and functioning as a team rather than
operating as a vehicle to market this young, improvisational player
whose misses are often as breathtaking as his makes. He is
averaging 23 points, seventh in the league, for a team that is
13-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets to me sometimes, but I have a lot of people around me
to keep me grounded,'' Carter said. ``I've got guys on this team
that let me know if we don't win, all that other stuff doesn't
matter. I'm learning.''
</P>
<P>
   He took several ill-advised shots and was 11 of 28 from the
field, but Carter also provided some of the best theater on Sunday.
Going past Glen Rice and Shaquille O'Neal in the fourth quarter, he
converted a wild, twisting reverse layup. Last season, when he was
named rookie of the year and rejuvenated an expansion franchise
known more for its cornball mascot than its play, he force-fed
Alonzo Mourning a dunk in his face.
</P>
<P>
   Against San Antonio earlier this month, Carter erupted for 39
points and one of the most scintillating moves of the season.
Blowing by Mario Elie on the left baseline, Carter rose up and
appeared to be challenging Tim Duncan's reach. Just as Duncan was
about to meet him, Carter contorted his body until he slithered
underneath the center and put the ball in softly off the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Though it came from a different angle, it vaguely resembled a
play in the 1990 NBA finals, when another 6-6 player who had left
North Carolina after his junior year appeared as if he were going
to dunk over the top of the Lakers, but instead switched to his
left hand for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Michael Jordan comparison is something he's been dealing
with since high school,'' said Carter's mother and full-time
business manager, Michelle Carter-Robinson. ``On one hand, it's
very flattering. You can't overlook the similarities. By the same
token, it gets a little old, too. Vince gets tired of hearing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Smith was often said to be the only coach who could contain
Jordan, with a structured program at North Carolina that
de-emphasized individual theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at all the guys that have been through Carolina,''
Carter said in reference to Smith's influence. ``Myself, Jerry
Stackhouse, we all didn't score many points.'' Carter, in fact,
never averaged more than 15.6 points a game at North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we blossomed later,'' he said. ``We're prepared to blossom
by the time we get to the NBA. I think when you get here, you
realize, hey, what you were taught and what you were so-called held
back from, here's what he was teaching you.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter sees the game with amazing clarity for such an
inexperienced player, understanding the nuances of angles, the arc
on his shot, the spin of the ball. In fact, as evidenced by his
catnaps during games, it is almost as if the game is coming too
easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the time I've been around great players, at times they get
so bored they'll just try things,'' said Butch Carter, Toronto's
third-year coach and a veteran of NBA six seasons as a player. ``It
happened when I was around Magic and Isiah at different parts of my
career. And I just have to go through that with Vince. The great
thing about him is he'll let me bring him back to earth. I was
around Magic and Isiah at different parts of my career. And I just
have to go through that with Vince. The great thing about him is
he'll let me bring him back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince listens to Oak,'' Butch Carter said, referring to the
veteran power forward Charles Oakley, Vince Carter's on-court
protector and off-court counselor. ``If Oak tells him something was
wrong and he handled it wrong, he listens to him. He doesn't tell
Oak, `You're crazy' or `Get away from me; I don't care how many
years you played in the league.' He's a young person that respects
information.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammate Antonio Davis said: ``You fight the bad decisions
with him. In some instances, what can you say? It's like you're
yelling at him not to take the shot and then he hits it and you're
giving him a high-five. What do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter admitted: ``Sometimes I think I don't play hard for
four quarters or I kind of get lost out there sometimes. I know
that. I just have to continue to play through what's going on out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes criticism from elders constructively rather than
imagining some challenge against his manhood. Carter spent time
Sunday giving a motivational talk to 14 teen-agers after a tough
loss. He moves home to Florida during the summer, makes his bed and
takes out the garbage, ``just little things like that that reminds
the player that you're still a young man, that you still have
responsibilities, that you're not bigger than life or bigger than
basketball,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter-Robinson was a 21-year teaching veteran of Florida's
public schools before she retired two years ago to concentrate on
her son's career. ``You've got parents here who are not intimidated
by the NBA,'' she said. ``He's my son first and an NBA player
second. I'm still Mama. And I've been around the block a few times
more than he has, so he still listens to me.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carter has also become the center of a strictly monitored
business and marketing enterprise. Among his diverse interests,
Carter owns a company called Business in Flight.
</P>
<P>
   His mother said Carter had more than 20 people employed to
nurture and market his image, including three publicists whose main
job is to coordinate a master schedule with the Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   He just finished a two-week stretch that included more than five
dozen interviews, a Gatorade commercial shoot and a homecoming in
Orlando, Fla., in which he and members of his foundation passed out
food baskets to needy families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Night in and out, I can't get caught up in all that,'' he
said. ``Of course, you know you're going to disappoint some people.
I just try to give to as many people as I can. I'm a human, also. I
need time to rest, time to myself. I can't be everywhere at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his whirlwind schedule, Carter is well grounded, his
coach said. ``He doesn't have 20 friends from his old
neighborhood,'' said Butch Carter, who is not related to his star
player. ``Everyone working for him is a specialist in certain
areas. Team Carter is unbelievable. I call Mrs. Robinson `Canada's
First Mother.'''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said: ``Some of the time I hear him talking and some of
the things he had to do after practice or something he had to
before practice, it's like, wow. And you still made it to practice
on time, you got your work in after practice? That's tough, trying
to lift your team and sell the league at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to help the league by being himself. He's doing a
great job of it. Michael Jordan is the perfect example. He didn't
start winning championships until he started depending upon the
guys around him, making the guys around him better to make him
better. Vince is going to understand that. It's just going to take
some time. ``

ADVERTISING: THREE WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three acquisitions and an agency's closing are making news.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest of the acquisitions, Interpublic Group of Cos. in
New York, which owns agencies like Draft Worldwide, Lowe Group and
McCann-Erickson World Group, agreed Monday to buy NFO Worldwide
Inc. in Stamford, Conn., a leading market research company.
</P>
<P>
   The stock deal is valued at about $580 million.
</P>
<P>
   Interpublic is the world's No. 2 agency company in revenue, at
$4.3 billion behind Omnicom Group, according to the trade
publication Advertising Age, and is No. 1 in billings at $37.7
billion. NFO is to operate as a stand-alone autonomous unit of
Interpublic, perhaps as part of its Allied Communications Group
division.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition vaults Interpublic into the front ranks of the
market research field, which is booming because of the demand for
data related to interactive advertising. In fact, NFO describes
itself as the single largest provider of Internet-based marketing
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider market research an area of opportunity,'' said
Sean Orr, executive vice president and chief financial officer at
Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arguably, it was a bit of a hole in our portfolio of service
offerings. We're delighted to have that hole closed.''
</P>
<P>
   While Interpublic owns some small market research companies, it
has not been as large a force in that field as the WPP Group in
London, which has assiduously assembled an array of such
operations, primarily through acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a significantly larger presence, ideally globally,''
said Barry Linsky, senior vice president for planning and business
development at Interpublic. ``With NFO, we're gaining the size and
scope and a terrific brand.''
</P>
<P>
   NFO was originally known as National Family Opinion, after a
unit that polls consumers through surveys sent out under the name
Carol Adams _ an imaginary woman who could be considered the Betty
Crocker of market research. NFO, founded in 1946, has about 4,000
employees in 35 countries providing custom and syndicated marketing
information to more than 3,000 clients; annual revenue is estimated
at more than $425 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great strategic fit between two global leaders,'' said
William Lipner, chairman, chief executive and president at NFO,
``reaffirming the convergence of advertising agencies and market
research firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal call for NFO shareholders to receive $26 worth
of Interpublic stock for each NFO share they own. On the New York
Stock Exchange, NFO stock closed Friday at $14 and closed Monday at
$22.25, up $8.25. Interpublic shares, traded on the same exchange,
fell $2.3125 Monday, to $55.75.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition was announced as NFO warned that it expected a
significant shortfall in earnings during the current quarter, far
below the predictions of Wall Street analysts, and would take
fourth-quarter after-tax charges of $15 million to $20 million.
Interpublic was aware of those developments before making the deal,
Linsky and Orr said.
</P>
<P>
   The second acquisition involves Modem Media.Poppe Tyson in
Norwalk, Conn., an Internet advertising agency and Web site
creator, which agreed to buy Vivid Studios in San Francisco, a Web
site creator and consultant, for $64 million in cash and stock.
Modem Media.Poppe Tyson is partly owned by True North
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Vivid, which has about 100 employees, is
meant to help Modem Media.Poppe Tyson develop e-commerce sites more
efficiently and effectively. It will be the third deal in recent
months for Modem Media.Poppe Tyson, whose shares closed Monday at
$64.375, down $1.375, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   The third acquisition involves Powers &AMP; Associates in
Cincinnati, which agreed to buy another agency there, Sive/Young &AMP;
Rubicam. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Sive/Y&AMP;R has 24 employees working on accounts with billings
estimated at $42 million from clients like Frisch's Restaurants,
Mercy Health Partners and the U.S. Playing Card Co. Powers has
about 26 employees and clients like American Savings and Loan and
Progressive Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   The merged agency will operate under the Powers name, with
Charles Powers, 62, continuing as president. Michael Kitei, 62,
president and chief executive at Sive/Y&AMP;R, will serve as a
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new agency will be a long-held dream come true,'' Powers
said, referring to his attempt in 1977 to acquire the old Sive
agency, only to be outbid by Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York.
Sive/Y&AMP;R remained part of Y&AMP;R until 1994, when five managers bought
90 percent of the agency. Sive/Y&AMP;R is being acquired from current
management and Y&AMP;R, which is selling its 10 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the agency that is closing, effective immediately, is
Mulryan/Nash, a small New York shop specializing in campaigns aimed
at gay and lesbian consumers. Clients included Agouron
Pharmaceuticals, part of Warner-Lambert Co., and Subaru of America,
a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one thing'' that led to the decision, said Dave
Mulryan, president at Mulryan/Nash, adding that he could not
comment further.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter addressed to ``valued customers, vendors and
friends,'' Mulryan wrote that ``harsh financial circumstances
beyond our control'' led to the closing. Inquiries were referred to
Geron &AMP; Corsano, a New York law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's a bad situation not typical of other agencies
specializing in the gay market,'' said Sean Strub, chairman of Poz
Publishing LLC in New York, `it's a black mark on the gay market.''
He estimated that his company was owed about $125,000 for ad space
that Mulryan/Nash bought for clients in Poz and Poz en Espanol
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Agouron, which extensively advertises an AIDS drug, Viracept, in
publications read by gay men, sent letters to those magazines and
newspapers expressing regret over ``the unfortunate circumstances
of the agency closing.'' The letter notified the publications that
Rivendell Marketing in New York and Westfield, N.J., would take
over media duties from Mulryan/Nash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorry to see Mulryan/Nash go,'' said Todd Evans, chief
executive at Rivendell, adding that he did not think the agency's
difficulties were indicative of the health of the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies have a commitment to the gay market,'' said Evans,
who sells ad space in gay and lesbian publications in local markets
nationwide. ``Our business was up 30 percent this year, and we
expect another banner year next year.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In a move intended to provide seamless
service along growing trade corridors, Burlington Northern Santa Fe
and the Canadian National Railway said Monday that they have agreed
to combine operations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal creates the largest rail company in North America, with
its headquarters and leadership to be based in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said there will be little disruption for employees
or shippers because the rail networks do not overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Northern, which moved to Fort Worth from St. Paul,
Minn., in 1984, employs about 3,200 in Fort Worth, including 2,500
at its corporate headquarters. Executives said the combined company
will maintain a major presence in North Texas, including its
dispatch center.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the structuring of the deal, which gives a
majority of top management posts to Canadian National officials,
satisfies protectionist laws in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the rail companies employ about 67,000 in two
countries, and executives said that only a few thousand jobs will
be lost, probably through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   The merger requires approval from regulators and shareholders in
the United States and Canada, and executives said they do not
expect to complete the transaction until mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, a new holding company will be created, to be called
North American Railways. It would generate more than $12.5 billion
in annual revenue, and its 50,000 miles of track would cover much
of the continent.
</P>
<P>
   The system would stretch from Los Angeles to Halifax, Nova
Scotia, and from Vancouver to the Texas Gulf Coast. It would be
especially strong, analysts said, along the north-south corridors
that connect Mexico, Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That has become a busy route since the North American Free Trade
Agreement was approved early this decade, and traffic is expected
to grow sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``A map of this new railroad is truly incredible,'' said Robert
Krebs, Burlington's chief executive, during a news conference in
Montreal. ``This is a perfect time for us to get together.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies did not put a value on the deal, saying it was a
tax-free stock swap that does not pay a premium to shareholders of
either company.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington investors will receive one share in North American
Railways for each share in BNSF, while Canadian investors will get
1.05 shares. Burlington shareholders will control about two-thirds
of the stock in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the companies have a total market value topping $18
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted negatively to the deal, however, pushing
down the stock prices of both rail operators. In late trading at
4:15 p.m. Monday, Burlington's stock was down $3.5625, to $24.8125.
Canadian's stock fell $1.35 (Canadian) to $42.85 (Canadian) on the
Toronto exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal does not provide enough of a premium to
Burlington investors. And they noted that Canadian's top executive,
Paul Tellier, will be at the helm of the holding company, with his
associates making up most of the staff.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal closes, Krebs said he will become non-executive
chairman of the new company. Matthew Rose, currently president of
Burlington, will add the title of chief executive of Burlington
Northern Santa Fe, and is expected to remain at the Fort Worth
office.
</P>
<P>
   Another Burlington official, chief financial officer Thomas
Hund, will become CFO of North American.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member board of directors will include six members from
each company, plus three appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the rail companies said that the merger
willbenefit shareholders over the long-term by providing more
growth opportunities and lower operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts, noting the long regulatory process, said the gains
will be far down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``In three to five years, this will be the premier freight
railroad in North America,'' Terry Gardner, an analyst at Deutsche
Banc Alex Brown, told TheStreet.com. ``But the issue here is
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to submit their business plans to regulators
within 90 days. The U.S. Surface Transportation Board may review
the plans for as long as a year, officials said. A Canadian court,
which considers both the payout to shareholders and regulatory
laws, also must approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian National was a state railway until the government sold
it to the public in a 1995 stock offering. Executives acknowledged
that this deal was structured to meet Canadian rules that still
govern the business.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the new company's headquarters will be in Montreal;
a majority of its directors will be Canadian citizens; and no
single company will control 15 percent of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many Canadians, there's always a concern about `sleeping
with the elephant,' '' said Tony Hine, managing director of
National Bank Financial in Toronto. ``Economic nationalism is still
a big factor in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, one reporter asked whether a Canadian
company is being ``Americanized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the Americanization of CN,'' said Tellier,
Canadian National's chief executive. ``This is transforming CN into
a true North American company, while retaining a very strong
Canadian identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Krebs quickly cited the Montreal headquarters, the makeup of the
board, and the fact that Tellier, a Canadian, will be CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been extremely sensitive to that very issue,'' Krebs
said.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter added that Canadian law required those
concessions, Krebs added: ``It's the right thing to do, and we're
very happy to do it. Or we wouldn't be involved in this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The rail industry has always been marked by mergers, as
companies sought to expand their markets, offer better service and
boost profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Burlington-Canadian deal was driven by similar factors,
Krebs and Tellier said. In the first three years as a combined
company, they expect to generate as much as $600 million in
additional operating income by pulling in new business and cutting
costs.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about offering automakers a single rail line to
reach from Ontario and Detroit into California and Mexico. Other
routes would entice chemical makers from the Gulf Coast and lumber
companies in Canada, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What shippers want is seamless service with a single line,''
Tellier said. ``They want to deal with one bill, one invoice, one
account manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trucking's already there,'' he added. ``Now we want to be
fully integrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Shippers signalled some skepticism. Major mergers have rocked
the rail industry in this decade, often disrupting traffic as
companies tried to blend their computer systems and far-flung rail
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Union Pacific and Southern Pacific, along with Norfolk
Southern and CSX, have struggled to integrate lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we need another mega-merger when the industry is
already having trouble providing reliable service?'' said Ed
Emmett, president of the National Industrial Transportation League,
a trade group that represents shippers. ``We don't need it now.''

MCCAIN WOOING WOMEN VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain's call to arms for political reform has rallied men
to his cause, but the very intensity that is making his campaign
effective in New Hampshire may also have a downside with Republican
women, polls show.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Texas Gov. George W. Bush is attracting female GOP
voters by a significant margin. Poll results comparing the
preferences of men and women in early primary states show that,
although many women respect McCain, they express a clear preference
for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of this gender gap, McCain is turning increasingly in his
policy addresses to domestic issues that are of concern to both
sexes but traditionally of more interest to women, including
education, the environment and Social Security _ all issues Bush
has been speaking to for months.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, McCain interrupted a swing through veteran-haven
South Carolina to make his pitch on a women's Web site,
iVillage.com, and on Monday he outlined an environmental agenda in
a speech in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Personality also appears to play a role in the perception of
women voters.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Eaton, a Bush supporter and small-business owner from
Phoenix, said Bush is probably ``a little bit smoother'' than
McCain. And he focuses on the issues that are near and dear to
women, such as education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's some kind of a softness,'' Eaton said. ``He isn't trying
to show off or be cute, he's just an appealing kind of a person.''
</P>
<P>
   She said McCain appeals to different priorities.
</P>
<P>
   `McCain is a little bit more of a rough and tumble man's man,''
Eaton said. `He's been in the service . . . and he's very vocal
about that.`
</P>
<P>
   In most key primary states, Bush retains a considerable lead
among women.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Washington Post'' survey conducted Dec. 12-15 in New
Hampshire showed Bush leading McCain 49 to 32 percent among women,
while McCain led Bush among men 46 to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A mid-November CNN/Time poll in South Carolina indicated that
among men, Bush led McCain among women 66 to 11 percent, and he
also led McCain among men, 59 to 19 percent. &QL; 
Bush focuses on education &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with ``The Arizona Republic,'' Bush pinned his
advantage among women voters on his focus on education and his
unwillingness to take the usual hard-line stand on illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's probably because I've got a record on education
that is substantiated by results, that people know I'm passionate
for education,'' Bush said. ``And I think people recognize I'm
someone who has resisted bashing immigrants; that while I believe
in enforcing the border, I understand the motivations of why people
come to America to put food on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides are quick to note that they employ more women in top
positions than almost any other campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bush's top advisers are his foreign policy guru Condoleeza
Rice, national political director Maria Cino, communications
director Karen Hughes, and by Bush's count, his wife, Laura. &QL; 
MCCAIN HAS FEW WOMEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   y contrast, McCain employs few women in top spots. Among them
is Deb Gullett, a deputy campaign aide who works in McCain's
Phoenix office but who is considered one of his closest advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain's aides are confident that he is making up the
difference with women.
</P>
<P>
   ``As voters learn more about John McCain, those gender numbers
tend to even out,'' said Dan Schnur, McCain's communications
director, noting that in recent weeks, polls in New Hampshire have
shown dramatic increases in female support for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that voters found out about John McCain was
his war record and his time in Vietnam, and that tended to move
male voters more than females, in particular older voters who may
have served themselves,'' Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second thing that voters are learning about John McCain is
his support for campaign-finance reform, and that tends to appeal
to female voters more than male.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrasts extend to the way the two candidates campaign.
Bush has loaded up the airwaves with ads that show him surrounded
with children. McCain has ads featuring his time as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has mastered the art of the gentle shoulder shrug and
occasionally winks at those around him. McCain campaigns
frenetically and sometimes punches the air with his fist when his
speech becomes animated. &QL; 
`PASSION ISN'T THERE' &QL; 
Campaign observers say that for McCain to begin closing the
distance with women, he must be able to sell them on his commitment
to their issues.
</P>
<P>
   So far, in the presidential debates, McCain has appeared less
than gung-ho on domestic concerns, according to Sherry Bebitch
Jeffe, a political scientist at the Claremont University in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passion isn't there,'' Bebitch Jeffe said of McCain. ``It
is with Bush. He may be rote on many other issues, but he's not on
education.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's near singular focus on campaign finance reform and
national defense and national security to the exclusion of other
issue bucks ``the history of polling on women's attitudes, which is
that women tend to be doves,'' Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't like aggression, they don't like war, they don't
like change, and they don't like risk,'' Bebitch Jeffe said. &QL; 
SINKHOLE FOR GOP &QL; 
The gender gap turned into a sinkhole for Republicans in 1996, as
they watched women desert the party's standard bearer, Bob Dole, in
droves to vote for Bill Clinton. That year, Clinton held an
11-point advantage over Dole with women. In 1992, Bush's father
lost out to Clinton in part due to a four-point gender advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believes the 1996 loss was due in large part to the
gender gap, and the ``generational'' gap between Dole and the baby
boomers who have come to dominate American elections. &QL;

NEVER MIND SANTA CLAUS, WHO BELIEVES IN VIRGINIA THESE DAYS?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Curiosity led to a row house at 115 West 95th Street,
where one of the best-known sentiments of this holiday season was
born. The idea was to see if anyone knew that Virginia O'Hanlon
once lived there, or even had a clue who she was.
</P>
<P>
   It was a foolish mission. Inquiries produced polite shrugs or
don't-bother-me clicks of the intercom from the few people living
at No. 115. Their reaction should have been anticipated. After all,
this is a city of impermanence; collective memory often lasts about
as long as sand castles at high tide.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one thought that there just might be a plaque or some
other indication that, in this house 102 years ago, an 8-year-old
girl wrote a letter that produced perhaps this country's most
enduring secular affirmation of hope and faith.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her ``little friends'' at school had said there was no
Santa Claus, Virginia O'Hanlon wrote to the editor of The New York
Sun. Could they conceivably be right? In what would become
America's most famous newspaper editorial, Francis Pharcellus
Church of The Sun replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He exists,'' the editorial continued, ``as certainly as love
and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound
and give to your life its highest beauty and joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornball? You bet. Irresistible? That, too.
</P>
<P>
   Generations of open-hearted Americans have thought so (their
numbers including countless newspaper writers who have taken ``Yes,
Virginia'' and pounded it silly, often on the misguided assumption
that they were the first to play with that locution).
</P>
<P>
   You would think that a piece of New York writing of such grace
and durability deserved formal acknowledgment. Surely, something
creative could be figured out by city officials, whose taste in
tributes leans more to renaming streets Senor Wences Way and the
like.
</P>
<P>
   Given the absence of any public recognition, you can hardly
blame the present occupants of No. 115 for drawing a blank. ``Yes,
Virginia'' doesn't always ring a bell with Claus, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard of her, to tell you the truth, and I've been
doing this a long time,'' said Bob Williams, a sidewalk Santa for
14 years with Volunteers of America, the helping hand to some of
New York's neediest.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 66, was at his regular post during the weekend, on
Fifth Avenue, facing the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. He is
something of an expert, he said, on little children and their need
to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I tell them right up front that I'm not Santa,'' he said.
``I'm Santa's helper, and if they tell me something, I'll pass it
on to the big guy. I don't make promises I can't keep.''
</P>
<P>
   There is wizardry in that red suit, whether you believe it or
not, Williams added. ``When I'm in street clothes, I'm nobody,'' he
said. ``But the minute I put on that suit, I'm somebody. It changes
everything. Even when I go take a break, I can't really take a
break. I get mobbed.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not all magic. To steal from Barbara Basler, formerly
of The New York Times, being Santa can be a tough row to ho.
</P>
<P>
   Children today are more jaded than their older brothers and
sisters, Williams finds. The grown-ups who stuff cash in Santa's
chimney are usually tourists, not New Yorkers, who are too busy
rushing through the canyons of Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that work in those office buildings there, they don't
give,'' he said. ``The ones that don't have it, give it. The ones
that have it, they walk right by you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sad but true, agreed Linda McNeil, Volunteers of America's
director of development and communications. Altogether, the
Volunteers' eight sidewalk Santas are likely to collect about
$45,000 by Christmas Eve. Even though these are heady days on Wall
Street, the figure has held steady for several years, Ms. McNeil
said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, she said, ``the boom in the economy is not impacting
on our fund-raising at all. There are maybe a few donors who find
it advantageous to unload some stock on us.''
</P>
<P>
   What about all the cyber-generated money floating out there?
``The new wealth,'' Ms. McNeil said, ``has not necessarily been
trained in philanthropy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Santa is about more than money and gifts. Church of
The Sun knew that, and said so to Virginia O'Hanlon, who died in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``How dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus!''
he wrote. ``It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias.
There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to
make tolerable this existence.''

SENATOR VOWS TO STALL ACTION ON JUDGESHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A long-running dispute over executive appointments
flared again Monday as a Republican senator said he would block
every one of President Clinton's nominees for federal judgeships
until the president left office.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, said he would put
personal ``holds'' on every judicial nominee submitted to the
Senate for confirmation and urge other senators to do the same. The
senator said he was angry because the president recently made a
surprise reappointment to the National Labor Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has broken his word, yet again,'' Inhofe said in
reaction to Clinton's renaming of Sara M. Fox to another five-year
term on the labor board.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said that he had nothing against Ms. Fox, but that
she was not on a list of 13 appointments the White House planned to
make while Congress was in recess.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Jake Siewert, said Monday night that
there was no subterfuge, and that the White House had conferred
with Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader. As for
the list cited by Inhofe, Siewert said, ``It doesn't necessarily
correspond to our list.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate rules, any senator can put an indefinite hold on a
nominee. A dispute between Democratic and Republican lawmakers
delayed confirmation of dozens of judicial nominees for months
until it was apparently resolved in November. With dozens of
nominations still pending, Inhofe can delay the process again, if
he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution allows the president to bypass the Senate
confirmation process temporarily by making appointments during a
Congressional recess, with appointees allowed to serve without
confirmation until the end of the following year.

PINCAY'S TITLE ONE FOR THE AGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Nobody should be surprised by anything Laffit Pincay
does anymore. But he was surprised by what he did Monday at
Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the meeting, if you'd have asked me if I
had a chance to be leading rider, I'd have told you `No way,'''
Pincay told the fans in a winner's circle ceremony between races on
the track's closing day.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, 52, became the oldest man to capture the jockey title at
a major U.S. track, riding winners Ruff Ruckus in the fifth race
and Fantasy Leap in the ninth-race nightcap to finish with a 32-28
edge over Pat Valenzuela.
</P>
<P>
   The victory aboard front-running Ruff Ruckus clinched at least a
tie for the championship. Pincay pumped his right fist as he
crossed the finish in the $12,500 claiming event, a gesture not
unlike the one that accompanied his record 8,834th career win Dec.
10 at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, when Valenzuela failed to win the sixth
aboard Montjoy, Pincay had the title outright, marking the 38th
time he'd led the standings at a U.S. track and the first since the
1991 Hollywood Park spring-summer season.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Shoemaker was 44 when he won his last title at the 1975 Oak
Tree meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I won't have too many more chances,'' said Pincay, who
began the day with a 30-28 lead over Valenzuela. ``I'm thinking
about retiring in three or four more years....
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking the record was the ultimate for me. But this is the
icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay acknowledged he was helped by the absence of some other
top riders for much of the six-week meet. Still, he was delighted
to have proved he's still one of the circuit's best when he rides
competitive horses. He won with 22.1 percent of his mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy Leap was career win No.8,844.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he would break the record after a while,'' said Mike
Mitchell, who trains Ruff Ruckus. ``But to be the leading rider at
52, that says a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pincay broke Shoemaker's record 11 days ago, Mitchell was
disappointed the momentous winner wasn't one of his horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I got cheated,'' said Mitchell, describing how Pincay's
agent Bob Meldahl had begged out of an agreement to ride one of his
horses (who won) in an earlier race so he could switch to a Bill
Spawr-trained horse (who lost). ``I told Bob before the race, `If
I'd looked the horse up (and read his past performances), I never
would have let you off.' I was kinda semi-mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay's record-setting winner, Irish Nip, was trained by
Richard Mandella.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell, who describes himself as ``Laffit's biggest fan,''
got his consolation prize by saddling the title-clincher Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The achievement is his dieting all his life to maintain his
weight, when you know 90 percent of the riders couldn't have done
it. He's muscle on top of muscle,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a weight problem all my life, and I've tried all
sorts of diets, so I know what kind of willpower it takes. I've had
dinner with Laffit and seen him chew a piece of meat and spit it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, feeling the best he has in years, said he ate an entire
bagel one night recently and was ``scared'' to step on the scale
the next day. But he hadn't gained a pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing something right,'' he said with a laugh. ``I can't
wait to get home and have another bagel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom lines: Hollywood Park reported on-site increases of 2
percent in attendance (7,443 a day) and 11 percent in betting at
its first meet under Churchill Downs management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We caught every break,'' admitted track president Rick
Baedeker, referring to Pincay's record run, plentiful pick-six
carryovers and good weather during the season that opened Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   He described a two- to three-year plan to give the 62-year-old
facility's grandstand ``an overdue facelift,'' and a stepped-up
marketing effort.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Corey Nakatani, third in the standings with 27 wins,
rallied New Zealand-bred Accomplice ($10.20) to a 2{-length win
over favored Howbaddouwantit in the Dayjur Handicap turf sprint....
Bob Baffert won the training title, his first at Hollywood Park,
with a 14-11 edge over Richard Mandella.... Bob Ike of the Daily
News led the newspaper handicappers by selecting 80 winners (29.9
percent). &UR;

RULING IN LIBEL CASE HAILED BY NEW YORK MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decision that could broaden protection from libel suits,
New York state's highest court issued a ruling Monday making it
more difficult for people to sue news organizations over articles
that disclose details of their private lives provided the articles
raise issues of ``legitimate public concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous ruling by the state Court of Appeals involved a
libel lawsuit filed by Charles Huggins, the former husband of the
singer Melba Moore, over a series of articles published in The (New
York) Daily News in 1993. The articles chronicled the couple's
bitter divorce and Ms. Moore's accusation that her husband, who was
her manager, had committed ``economic spousal abuse'' by ruining
her career and bankrupting her.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins sued The Daily News and Ms. Moore for $90 million,
asserting that her statements were false, his reputation had been
destroyed and their divorce was a private matter. Monday's ruling
focused on what standard Huggins would have to prove in court to
win his libel case.
</P>
<P>
   The case sets a precedent because lower courts had ruled that
while Ms. Moore was a public figure, her former husband was not.
Under New York law, people deemed public figures must prove that a
news organization's account was malicious before a libel suit can
proceed, but others must prove only that a news organization was
negligent, a lower standard.
</P>
<P>
   In an initial victory for Huggins, the Appellate Division of the
state Supreme Court ruled in April that the couple's divorce was a
private matter and that to win he only needed to prove that The
Daily News had been negligent in printing the articles.
</P>
<P>
   But in its unanimous opinion Monday, the Court of Appeals
reversed that ruling. Judge Howard Levine wrote that because the
articles raised an issue of public concern _ what Ms. Moore called
``the black-on-black crime of economic spousal abuse'' _ Huggins
would have to prove in court that the newspaper was ``grossly
irresponsible'' in printing the articles, a far higher standard.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for The Daily News and other New York news organizations
hailed the decision Monday. ``The net effect of this opinion is
that the flow of information in the state will be protected,'' said
Eve Burton, deputy general counsel for The Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen news organizations, including The New York Times, The
Associated Press, Dow Jones Co., ABC, NBC and CBS filed legal
papers urging the state's highest court to overturn the lower court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Rosen, the lawyer representing Huggins, said the ruling
would give the news media free reign to report on people's private
lives and then claim that the articles raised important social
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that the most private aspects of a person's life
can be reported on and arguably declared a matter of public
concern,'' he said. ``Whether it is a private person's very private
divorce or a person getting a jaywalking ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said that Huggins would still go to trial in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state constitution and a series of rulings by the
Court of Appeals, news media in New York generally enjoy far more
protection from libel suits than news organizations in other
states. Richard Winfield, a lawyer for The Associated Press who
drafted the joint legal papers filed by the 16 media organizations,
said there was concern that the appeals court could have eroded
those protections.
</P>
<P>
   But in his opinion, Levine criticized the lower court with
strong language. ``Absent clear abuse, the courts will not
second-guess editorial decisions as to what constitutes matters of
genuine public concern,'' Levine wrote. ``The Appellate Division
did not accord the deference to editorial judgment our decisions
require.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A JETS' BIDDER, WITH NO FANFARE, MAY HAVE AN EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If public renown were a prerequisite to owning a
sports team, Robert Wood Johnson IV would be excluded. But Johnson
is a Jets bidder, competing for the team against better-known
rivals like Charles F. Dolan and Sam Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan is not a headline grabber, but his company, Cablevision,
controls Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall, tried to
buy the Yankees and is trying to buy the Mets. Grossman is a
garrulous former senatorial candidate in Arizona and game-show
announcer who made his fortune by developing shopping malls. He
tried to buy the Washington Redskins earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Woody Johnson has done none of that. A great-great-grandson
of the founder of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, his name has never come up in
connection with buying a sports franchise, but he is Dolan's most
serious rival to acquire the Jets, for as much as $600 million. His
low profile may prove beguiling to the Leon Hess estate _ the late
owner defined quiet ownership _ especially if he offers the most
cash.
</P>
<P>
   The race for the Jets may end by Jan. 18 when National Football
League owners meet in Manhattan to discuss the sale of the Jets and
49 percent of the Baltimore Ravens, a deal announced Sunday. By
then, Goldman, Sachs, which is handling the Jets sale, is expected
to have picked a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is the chairman of the Johnson Co., a Manhattan
investment firm and philanthropy that serves as his base of
operations. Although a stranger in the sports world, Johnson is
well known in the health care and Republican Party worlds. He is
the chairman of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International and
a board member of Robert Wood Johnson University Foundation in
Princeton, N.J., one of the country's largest philanthropies. He
has also given more than $1 million to the Wildlife Conservation
Society, the parent of the Bronx Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The few news stories that mention Johnson cite his GOP
activities or his attendance at local benefits for the diabetes
foundation, the Bronx Zoo, the Mounted Unit of the New York City
Police Department and Brazilian rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being part of the Johnson family, it behooves him to be
interested in health care,'' said Harvey Holzberg, president of
Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J. ``He
was one of the people who interviewed me for this job, and
afterward, I never thought I'd see him again, but he calls me
regularly, with advice and suggestions.'' Johnson has underwritten
the hospital's nurse scholarship program for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   One of Johnson's three daughters, Casey, 20, has diabetes, and
his desire to raise money for a cure animates his work. ``When you
see what your daughter has to do to live, and when you see other
kids less well off losing eyesight, limbs or kidneys, you can't get
any more passionate,'' said Ross Cooley, head of the diabetes
foundation's finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``He's the best one-on-one fund-raiser I've ever seen.
He has contributed $12 million to the foundation, but you have to
double or triple it to see what he has done around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Johnson testified before Congress in favor of
research to clone pancreatic beta cells to provide a cure that
insulin cannot. The cloned cells ``would not be as susceptible to
attack by her immune system,'' he said of his daughter. ``Creating
these replacement beta cells for Casey would not require cloning a
new Casey, but they would give her a new lease on life.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Johnson, his daughter, and his wife, Sale, wrote a book
called ``Managing Your Child's Diabetes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooley said he was not surprised to learn that the trim,
bespectacled Johnson, a sports fan and squash player, chose to bid
for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to his competitive nature,'' he added. ``His
management style is conducive to that; he can screen and select
leaders, which I think would wear well in that world.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, Johnson's net worth is enough to keep him in the
hunt. ``And he has access to a lot more money,'' Cooley added.
Johnson may choose to add a limited partner, like Stephen M. Ross,
a New York real estate developer.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Johnson is a key Republican fund-raiser. He gave
$130,000 to the Republican Party between 1997 and 1998, held a
fund-raiser for New York Gov. George E. Pataki's 1998 re-election
campaign and gave $22,583 to Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
re-election campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 52, who is one of Bush's top New York fund-raisers for
his presidential run, played a part in Team 100, a group of major
backers of former President George Bush, the governor's father.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a political passion shared by Johnson and Bush the
younger, Johnson would like to add sports ownership to his resume,
as it was for Bush when he owned a part of the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, buythejets.com, an on-line group that wants to buy
the team, is appealing its exclusion from the sale process by the
NFL. It is asking fan-investors to e-mail Eliot Spitzer, the New
York State attorney general, to demand an investigation of the
league's ``anticompetitive practices'' and an injunction against
the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Members of buythejets.com have met with Harry First, head of the
attorney general's antitrust division. But yesterday, a spokesman
for Spitzer said he did not know on what grounds the attorney
general's office could intervene.

   SOUTHINGTON, Conn. _ The first hint that something different was
going on at the Christian Tabernacle Church was the sight of two
camels, Bill and Eli, tied up in front, beside the main road of
this Hartford suburb. A few feet away, hundreds of minivans and
sport utility vehicles snaked through neighboring parking lots as
the families inside waited for a four-minute glimpse of the birth
of Jesus Christ, as seen through their car windows.
</P>
<P>
   This is among the latest, and oddest, wrinkles in
late-20th-century Christmas revelry: the drive-through, live-action
Nativity scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, and certainly in New England, we tend to be
very fast-food-oriented and this kind of meets people where they're
at,'' said John Muldoon, a church member dressed as a Roman
centurion. He held a walkie-talkie, continually muttering
directions to the shepherds milling about.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the crowd, Muldoon's assessment was on the mark.
About 275 cars came through on the first night, and 400 on the
second. With an average of four people per car, about 2,700 people
wheeled past the depiction of the birth of Christ over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Tabernacle's is only the newest drive-through Nativity
scene in Connecticut. At the United Methodist Church in nearby
Cheshire, the congregation has been holding live-action
drive-throughs for the last 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition is evidently taking hold around the country;
Cheshire got the idea when a how-to pamphlet detailing such
pageants arrived from the United Methodist headquarters in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very popular,'' said Sue Dougherty, who helps sew
costumes at the Cheshire church. ``People even come from New York
and Massachusetts. It's pretty much a continual steam of cars.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nativity at Christian Tabernacle last weekend, featuring 23
live animals, began with a centurion handing motorists a Christmas
tape to play in their cars as they drove along. First stop: the
``back through time'' tunnel, with fog and eerie lighting, courtesy
of an old disco ball. Motorists entered the deep past through a
plastic car-wash curtain. The church was aiming for a ``creation of
the world'' feeling, ``kind of like going through the cosmos,''
said Muldoon, who masterminded this attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the other side, visitors watched Mary and Joseph
knocking at the innkeeper's door as the tape sang of Jesus' birth
and Mary rubbed her belly and moaned. Donkeys brayed at the
minivans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says: `Where did Christmas go? The spirit of
Christmas has been so watered down,'' said Jay Leroux, a church
member dressed as a centurion. ``People are really feeling this.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet along, another Mary and Joseph couple rocked their
baby (a doll) in a manger next to a pen full of sheep. And just
beyond that, Ryan Maringola, a high school student, sat atop a
throne, playing King Herod. The king held court as two camels,
rented from a petting zoo in Goshen, tugged on their lead lines in
front of him. Motorists finished their tour by cruising past a
half-dozen carolers.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few first-timers' glitches, naturally; helpers
sometimes did not rewind the tapes properly and since so many cars
have built-in CD players, the centurions had to hustle portable
tape decks back to the front of the line as each family finished.
There was also the inescapable fact that it was sometimes quicker
to simply park and order your Big Mac, instead of waiting on line
at the drive-through. So, too, at the Nativity. The Tabernacle's
journey took only 4 minutes. The wait on line was closer to 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bumping and grinding a bit with this being the first
year,'' Muldoon cheerfully admitted. ``But we kind of wanted to do
something a little more special than the rest of the cardboard
cutout nativities.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anyone familiar with drive-through windows knows that
the real advantage is not speed or convenience, but privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that people are a lot more comfortable in their own
cars,'' Muldoon said. ``And they're a lot more likely to go to a
drive-through than a church service.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention that most people do not get to see live animals
in church. ``People really like their kids experiencing the
realness of it,'' said Michael Chevalier, a data processing manager
turned Roman centurion, who was stationed in front of Bill and Eli,
the camels. ``I didn't expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great!'' said 10-year-old Erica Lachat, bouncing up and
down in the back of her parents' minivan. The carolers had
impressed Erica. But her 7-year-old sister, Elizabeth, said she
would always remember the camels.

BARNES HAS NEW START WITH BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAHUKU, Hawaii _ At approximately 4 p.m. Monday, UCLA forward
Matt Barnes gave up. He had waited three days for an English grade
that would lift his academic suspension and enable him to join the
Bruins this week for the three-game Pearl Harbor Classic. When it
wasn't posted by 4, Barnes packed his bags and headed to LAX for a
flight home, to Sacramento, for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The grade arrived with Barnes somewhere on the 405. UCLA placed
a hold on his ticket, tracked him down at the Southwest terminal
and sent him to a Delta flight bound for Honolulu. He was scheduled
to arrive here late Monday night, and he'll be in uniform for the
first-round game today against Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of the effort he put forth in allowing himself to
be reinstated,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``Hopefully, this
was a valuable lesson in terms of priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a 6-foot-8 sophomore, failed a summer school class and
had to pass four classes in the fall quarter to meet NCAA progress
standards.
</P>
<P>
   His return bolsters a frontline depleted by JaRon Rush's
suspension. The Bruins (4-1) now have four experienced big men _
starters Dan Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso, reserve Sean Farnham and
Barnes _ for the most demanding week of their season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have come at a better time, with three games in
three days,'' Lavin said. ``Matt's had a couple of pretty good
weeks of practice. I think the question for him will be less
conditioning and more about timing and the growing pains that come
with not playing in game situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's other challenge is to motivate the No.18 Bruins. The
Pearl Harbor Classic is not exactly loaded with marquee names:
Maine, Colorado State, San Jose State, Florida A&AMP;M, South Florida,
The Citadel and the host, BYU-Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   On reputation and talent, UCLA is heavily favored to return home
with a 7-1 pre-Christmas record.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Bruins never play well in these early-season
tournaments, even against teams they're supposed to overpower. They
lost to Santa Clara and Vanderbilt in the 1995 Maui Invitational.
They lost to Tulsa in the 1996 preseason NIT. They were humiliated
by North Carolina in the 1997 Great Alaska Shootout, and they lost
to Maryland and Kentucky last year in the Puerto Rico Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be wary with every team,'' Farnham said. ``DePaul
was a big win for us, especially coming off that loss to Gonzaga.
We needed something to lift our spirits. Now, if we get on a roll,
we can go home 7-1. But we know from what's happened in the past
that we can't take anyone for granted.''

3 TV NEWS OPERATIONS UNITE TO PROVIDE VIDEO TO AFFILIATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The news operations of CBS, ABC and Fox agreed Monday
to form a cooperative service to supply video pictures of news
events to the affiliated stations of each network. NBC News was
expressly excluded.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that the three news organizations, which
normally compete in news coverage, had formally united to create a
joint enterprise. The shared coverage, to be called Network News
Service, will mainly involve video from news scenes. Only rarely
will the coverage include any voices of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The three news organizations emphasized that they would still
provide any exclusive or enterprise reporting to their affiliates
on an individual basis. And no affiliate will be able to use
coverage being provided by a competing station in that city.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose, said Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, is
to provide local stations with the best pictures of news events as
fast as possible, while ``freeing resources for unilateral
reporting.'' He added, ``This is not joint news gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC News executives expressed some surprise about the
arrangement Monday, saying that joining the group had not been
discussed with them. ``We find it curious that we were not included
in these discussions,'' said Alexandra Constantinople, the
spokeswoman for NBC News, a unit of the General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   One possible goal of the combined coverage is to counter the
widespread use of video collected by the Cable News Network. Many
affiliates of the broadcast networks routinely use pictures from
CNN on their newscasts, always including an identifying logo of CNN
on the bottom right corner of the screen. As one senior network
news executive put it, ``We'd be happy to see a lot less of that
logo on our stations.''
</P>
<P>
   But CNN executives said they were confident that their
longstanding relationship with more than 600 local stations wouldd
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Neither CBS nor ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Co., has an
all-news cable channel so they have a natural interest in making
this kind of cooperative arrangement. Fox does have an all-news
channel, but it competes directly with MSNBC, the one owned by NBC.
That possibly accounts for NBC's exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   As for NBC, Heyward said only, ``We did not approach them.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyward said the plan for the joint news service grew out of
regular conversations he was having with David Westin, the
president of ABC News, and Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News, a
unit of the News Corp. ``We have a relationship,'' Heyward said.
``We all know each other.'' He added that each network had
consulted with its lawyers to ensure there was no question of any
antitrust violation in such a cooperative arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The news organizations have cooperated ad hoc in the past.
During the coverage of the crash of the plane owned by the golfer
Payne Stewart, for example, a crew from a CBS-affiliated station in
Des Moines reached the scene of the crash first, but its satellite
truck was not there. A truck from Fox soon arrived, however, and
the two organizations cooperated to send out the first pictures of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   During the coverage of the funeral of John F. Kennedy Jr., ABC's
helicopter supplied pictures to CBS when that crew had to fly back
for refueling and CBS did the same.

EDITORIAL: RUSSIA'S NEW PARLIAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Dec. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Several distinct messages can be drawn from Sunday's
parliamentary elections in Russia, some more encouraging than
others. Most hearteningly, voters showed a clear preference for
centrists, selecting what may turn out to be the first
reform-minded Duma majority since the Soviet collapse. But the main
centrist party, Unity, allied with President Boris Yeltsin and
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, built its success on jingoistic
exploitation of the brutal Russian military campaign in Chechnya.
The results were also skewed by the unequal enforcement of election
rules, dirty campaign tricks and the crude bias of television
stations allied with the Kremlin. These outlets fed Russians a
stream of unproven criminal accusations against the two leaders of
a rival party, former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The allocation of parliamentary seats is still incomplete. But
it appears that the Communists just barely remained the largest
party. Challenging them closely is Putin's Unity Party. An allied
party of economic reformers did well enough to bring Putin close to
a working majority. When members elected from the liberal Yabloko
Party and the Fatherland-All Russia alliance of Primakov and
Luzhkov are added in, moderates could end up with more than half
the total seats.
</P>
<P>
   Those gains could help bring economic reform back to life and
revive hopes of ratifying nuclear arms control treaties with the
United States. But that will require the centrist parties to
cooperate on legislative goals even as they prepare to line up
behind competing candidates in next summer's presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving substantive results from the new parliamentary
alignment will largely depend on Putin, a former KGB officer who
has built his popularity mainly on Russian military successes in
Chechnya. Putin's own ideological and political instincts are
unclear. Russia's economy has revived somewhat in recent months,
but those gains flowed mainly from last year's ruble devaluation
and the recent doubling of world oil prices. Continued growth
depends on pushing through reforms long stymied by the Communists
and their parliamentary allies. The most urgently needed measures
are a simplified and enforceable tax system, strengthened legal
protections for Russian and foreign investors and a crackdown on
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   One of Putin's strongest opponents for the presidency is likely
to be Primakov, an experienced politician who has coupled promises
of strong leadership with a pledge to avoid wrenching economic
change. Although Primakov's party got only about half as many votes
as Putin's this week, the presidential race could be closer.
Russia's party system is weak, and sentiment can change swiftly in
response to unforeseen events, including possible reverses in
Chechnya. What the voters surely deserve is a cleaner campaign than
they got this time, with honest media coverage for all sides. Putin
should use his new political strength to assure a fairer
presidential race.  &QL;

SPREWELL AND CAMBY HELP KNICKS MEASURE UP TO HORNETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Knicks muddled through a schedule full of teams
searching for crawl space at the bottom of the league in the last
two weeks, and had no real read on how they measured up against the
league's elite teams.
</P>
<P>
   They discovered they were right with them after taking the
Eastern Conference's best team into overtime and defeating the
Charlotte Hornets, 112-109, in an intense, playoff-like game Monday
night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   After Coach Jeff Van Gundy played a shell game with his
personnel _ even changing the starters _ to find the right match
against the versatile Hornets, it came down to a familiar
combination of aggression and energy: Latrell Sprewell and Marcus
Camby.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell scored 6 of the Knicks' first 8 points in overtime and
provided the pass to Camby for a dunk that put his team in position
to win. Camby not only left with a highlight on offense, but came
through with a key block on a Derrick Coleman shot with 37 seconds
left in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell finished with 30 points, Allan Houston added 31 and
Patrick Ewing came away with 18 rebounds. Finally, the rebounding
the Knicks had been waiting for arrived on cue as the Knicks ended
the Hornets' winning streak at eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Going into overtime could have been a letdown for the Knicks
considering how they had surged ahead in the fourth quarter. The
Knicks went on an 18-0 run early in the quarter and held a 10-point
lead with four minutes to play, but the Hornets came back and tie
the score with 12.2 seconds left when Eddie Jones hit two free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had a chance to win the game in regulation, but
Houston missed a jumper over Anthony Mason with three seconds left
and Ewing missed a putback jumper at the buzzer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has sarcastically called the Houston-Sprewell
backcourt _ a tandem so popular with fans _ the ``panacea'' for the
Knicks. Monday night, he stopped mocking the notion and benched
Charlie Ward to start the game with a big lineup against a
streaking Hornets team that travels on a bulk rate.
</P>
<P>
   In ending Ward's regular-season streak of 157 games as a
starter, Van Gundy wanted size on size and started a front court of
Larry Johnson, Camby and Ewing against Mason, Coleman and Elden
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the move only led the Knicks into a
first-quarter calamity.
</P>
<P>
   Out of sync and disorganized, the Knicks started 1 for 17 from
the field and quickly fell behind, 17-5. Once Ward was inserted
into the game late in the first quarter, some balance was restored
and the Knicks were able to pull to 51-46 at the half. The score
was only that close because Ward hit a long 3-pointer at the buzzer
and the Knicks were outrebounding an opponent for only the second
time in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the locker room, the Knicks regrouped and Van Gundy
tried the big lineup again to start the second half. And this time,
there was some success.
</P>
<P>
   Much more focused and aggressive, the Knicks used a 3-pointer by
Johnson as part of a 7-2 run to tie the score early in the third.
After a steal by Johnson that led to a layup by Sprewell, the
Knicks took the lead for the first time in the game three minutes
into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was a furious back-and-forth in a third quarter
that contained 12 lead changes and a handful of high-energy plays
by Sprewell, who took off after a steal for a one-handed dunk that
pumped up the decibel level of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets remained calm amid the Knicks' rush and combated
every highlight play with some assertive moves that put them at the
free-throw line 12 times in the quarter. After a free throw by
Mason with 2.6 seconds left, the Hornets held a 74-73 lead entering
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Knicks were close. Before Ward came into the game
in the first quarter, there was nothing but misery for the Knicks,
particularly for a slow-footed, languid Ewing. He missed his first
six shots and allowed Campbell to slip by him on a succession of
layups.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was also the unwitting culprit to a Camby injury. After
missing a putback and slipping down, Ewing was in the way of a
backpedaling Camby. The spindly forward tripped over Ewing and
sprained his left wrist on the hard landing with 9:51 left in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, nothing was going right for the Knicks. Mason was
bludgeoning Johnson in the post and the Knicks were missing
everything on the offensive end. With 4:35 left in the first
quarter, Ward replaced Houston. With Ward on the bench, the Knicks
were a minus-10. With Ward on the court, they were a plus-5.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he entered, a sense of calm was restored. Although
the Hornets kept beating the Knicks down court on fast-break
attempts and threatened to blow the game open, it was Ward who kept
pulling the Knicks back. He hit a 3-pointer with four minutes left
in the half to put the Knicks within 2, 38-36. On the Hornets' next
possession, an energized Sprewell swiped the ball and drove for a
fast-break layup to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets, boosted by a 3-pointer by David Wesley, took a
45-40 lead with two minutes left. Ward helped close that gap at the
end of the half with a 3-pointer from 46 feet against one of the
elite teams in the East. The Hornets came in on an eight-game
winning streak and the high of having embarrassed the Miami Heat
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you try to do is you try to play every game hard
because they all count the same toward getting to the playoffs,''
Van Gundy said before the game. ``When you do play good teams, you
do have a sense of what you need to work on to improve.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: ATTACKING PRISONERS' RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Dec. 21:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The push in Congress and in many states to limit the ability of
prisoners to seek redress for civil rights violations has
intensified in recent years. But no effort has been as sweeping as
legislation approved recently by the Michigan legislature that
removes all prisoners in state and county jails from the protection
of the state's civil rights law and the state disabilities law.
Incredibly, the legislation now awaiting Gov. John Engler's
signature would apply retroactively to eliminate a pending
class-action lawsuit brought under the Civil Rights Act by women
prisoners who have been sexually abused by prison guards.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan prison system has been the subject of extensive
press coverage and outside scrutiny for allegations of sexual
assaults against women inmates. A 1994-95 United States Justice
Department investigation found patterns of sexual harassment,
including rapes and assaults and widespread fear of retaliation for
reporting abuse. A federal lawsuit brought by women inmates in 1996
remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   A separate class-action case, representing more than 1,000
female inmates, was filed in state court in 1996. The new
legislation would eliminate the statutory grounds for this case.
But the legislation's impact goes far beyond stopping this
particular lawsuit. It strips all prisoners of anti-discrimination
rights under state law. Thus even prisoners who face racial
discrimination at the hands of guards and wardens would have no
meaningful recourse against the state in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say that this legislation will save taxpayers money.
They focus on frivolous litigation, but the legislation would also
block meritorious civil rights claims. They also argue that
prisoners can seek relief in federal court under federal civil
rights laws. But in recent years, Congress has made it very
difficult for prisoners to bring suits in federal court. Even when
they do, prisoners cannot, for example, get monetary damages in
federal court unless they suffer physical injury. Common forms of
abuse, such as sexual groping or aggressive harassment by a guard,
would not necessarily result in bodily injury.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of potential federal remedies does not justify
erasing state law protections. State officials usually chafe at
federal intrusion into state institutions. The new Michigan
legislation would invite that intrusion by forcing inmates to go to
federal judges for relief. This egregious legislation attacks the
basic rights of prisoners as persons under the law, and removes a
powerful legal deterrent against prison abuse.

VERMONT HIGH COURT BACKS RIGHTS OF SAME-SEX COUPLES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Vermont Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Monday
that the state must guarantee the very same protections and
benefits to gay and lesbian couples that it does to heterosexual
spouses. The court left it to the Legislature to either legalize
gay marriage, which no state has yet done, or adopt a domestic
partnership law, which would be the most sweeping in the country.
</P>
<P>
   To extend equal rights to homosexual couples ``who seek nothing
more, nor less, than legal protection and security for their avowed
commitment to an intimate and lasting relationship is simply, when
all is said and done,'' the ruling said, ``a recognition of our
common humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The court found that it was unconstitutionally discriminatory in
Vermont to deny marriage licenses to homosexual couples, depriving
them of the myriad benefits, from inheritance rights to health
insurance to tax breaks, that accrue to heterosexual married
couples.
</P>
<P>
   It left to the Legislature whether to establish a system
recognizing gay couples as domestic partners, with the benefits
like those of spouses, or to simply include homosexual partners in
the state's marriage laws. It gave lawmakers an unspecified
``reasonable period of time'' to consider the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Shumlin, the president pro tempore of the Vermont Senate,
said on Monday that the state's predominantly Democratic lawmakers
may decide in the coming session how to respond. Shumlin said he
expected it would be much easier to get votes for a domestic
partnership law than one creating full-fledged gay marriages, but
``both are strong possibilities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the court says, `You have a class of people whose civil
rights are being trampled upon,' Vermonters want to remedy that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   William Sorrell, the Vermont attorney general, said of domestic
partnership: ``It would likely be a civilly sanctioned relationship
that would, for all intents and purposes, have the benefits and
protections a traditionally married couple would have but wouldn't
be called a marital relationship. They wouldn't be called spouses,
they'd be called domestic partners, and for a number of people,
that makes an enormous difference.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beth Robinson, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that
unlike marriage, domestic partnership would not entitle couples to
benefits from the federal government and all private employers.
</P>
<P>
   Piecemeal systems of protections and benefits for gay and
lesbian couples have been enacted in recent years around the
country, but advocates for gay rights said on Monday that because
the Vermont ruling would cover all possible benefits, it would put
the state far ahead of all others. California and Hawaii have
statewide domestic partnership systems, they said, but they pale
next to what is coming in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   If Vermont chooses full-fledged gay marriage and homosexual
couples begin flocking to the state to wed, their legal status in
their home states would prove a very tangled issue, experts said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to legalize gay marriage has inspired a vigorous
opposition. Since the prospect arose in a Hawaii case in 1991,
nearly 30 states have passed laws against gay marriage. But gay
rights advocates say it is not clear whether those laws would stand
against challenges. Most likely, legal experts say, there would be
state-by-state battles over recognizing same-sex marriages
performed in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision, written by Chief Justice Jeffrey L. Amestoy,
exhilarated the three couples who brought the case against the
state, as well as their lawyers and the many gay and civil rights
groups supporting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrated our 27th anniversary together in October,'' one
of the couples, Holly Puterbaugh and Lois Farnham, said in a joint
statement. ``We look forward to the time when we can finally make
it official.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling brought expressions of dismay from religious and
conservative groups and others who oppose gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is not only troubling but it is tremendously
disappointing,'' said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the American
Center for Law and Justice, a national conservative group, in a
statement. ``While this legal decision is designed to elevate the
status of same-sex couples, it really represents a slap in the face
for marriage between a man and a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, Craig Bensen, an evangelical pastor and vice
president of Take It to the People, a coalition that opposes gay
marriage, said the group was considering a strategy like that used
in Hawaii and Alaska, where opponents of gay marriage put the idea
to a referendum and got enough votes to block it. The Hawaii
Supreme Court dismissed as moot the gay-marriage case there on Dec.
10, because a 1998 ballot measure had authorized lawmakers to
restrict the definition of marriage to man-woman unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect there will be momentum for a constitutional
amendment to clarify the nature of marriage,'' Bensen said. ``The
difficulty is, we've got the toughest Constitution to amend in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorrell noted that because the decision was based on the state
Constitution rather than the federal one, the ruling cannot be
appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The provision of the Vermont Constitution referred to by the
court was the common benefits clause, which says that the
government ought to be ``instituted for the common benefit,
protection and security of the people, nation or community, and not
for the particular emolument or advantage of any single person,
family or set of persons who are a part only of that community.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the court's ruling focused on benefits rather than
marriage itself, lawyers for the same-sex couples said on Monday
that they believed that the Legislature would ultimately choose
full-fledged marriage for same-sex couples. A domestic partnership
system would not go far enough to secure gay couples the exact
privileges accorded heterosexual ones, like access to benefits from
the federal government and private employers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legal status of marriage carries with it a lot of
baggage,'' said Ms. Robinson, the lawyer for the couples. ``The
Legislature will come to understand that as a practical matter, you
can't call it something different and have it be truly equal.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Matt Coles, director of the Lesbian and Gay Rights Project of
the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the phrase
``domestic partnership'' was invented only 19 years ago, when there
was virtually no recognition of gay and lesbian relationships and
the whole idea was so radical that when the San Francisco City
Council passed a domestic partnership law, Mayor Dianne Feinstein,
now a U.S. senator, vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about the way law and society move,'' Coles said,
``to go from San Francisco considering domestic partnerships too
far out there in 1981, to all five justices of the Vermont Supreme
Court taking equal treatment for granted in 1999 _ it's
astonishing, it really is.''
</P>
<P>
   While the justices, who are appointed by the governor and can be
removed by the Legislature, concurred that gay couples should be
protected from discrimination, one, Denise R. Johnson, wrote that
the court should order the state to let them marry. To do
otherwise, she wrote, would consign them to ``an uncertain fate in
the political cauldron'' of a moral debate in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The case began in 1997 when the three couples _ Ms. Puterbaugh
and Ms. Farnham, Stan Baker and Peter Harrigan, and Nina Beck and
Stacy Jolles _ filed suit after their local town clerks denied them
marriage licenses. A Superior Court judge turned them down, but
they appealed to the State Supreme Court, which heard their
arguments last year.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, Ms. Puterbaugh told reporters on Monday, will make
this a special Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's going to be a little extra feeling of family
now,'' she said.

ON THE TRAIL OF TERRORISM, IN WAKE OF ARREST IN WASHINGTON

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal authorities have concluded that an Algerian
man arrested with bomb components as he tried to enter Washington
state last week from Canada represented a serious terrorist threat,
but are far from certain about the purpose or target of any
possible attack.
</P>
<P>
   As counterterrorism agents sifted through the background of the
suspect, Ahmed Ressam, examining links to known Middle Eastern
terror groups, President Clinton's national security adviser said
Monday that there was no specific evidence, beyond the case of
Ressam, that foreign nationals were plotting other terrorist acts
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, said that Americans
should be watchful as they prepared for New Year's activities, but
said that counterterrorism officials knew of no additional domestic
threats. The State Department had previously cautioned Americans
traveling overseas to be vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, customs inspectors in Vermont detained a man and
woman on Sunday evening trying to enter the United States from
Canada, one of them carrying false documents, officials said. But
law enforcement officials said Monday that they were uncertain of
the significance of the inquiry in Vermont or whether it was in any
way related to the arrest of Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are examining whether Ressam is associated with
any known terrorist group, like the Islamic Armed Group. Officials
said they did not yet know whether he belonged to the group or had
received training in improvised explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, law enforcement officials said they had determined that
Ressam could have used the materials to construct a lethal
explosive device and, on that basis, decided he was a serious
potential threat.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, who was caught by a Customs Service inspector on Dec. 14
as he arrived on a car ferry at Port Angeles, Wash., was carrying
in his vehicle materials that could be assembled into a crude but
powerful bomb. The materials included more than 20 ounces of a
nitroglycerin derivative and digital timing devices that could be
used in a detonator.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam appeared nervous when questioned by an inspector and
tried to flee after the ferry arrived. He carried two driver's
licenses, one under an apparently assumed name, officials said. He
had a hotel reservation in Seattle for one night and a rental car
contract with a return date of Dec. 16, indications, the officials
said, that he was planning a short stay in Seattle and might be
acting only as an intermediary or courier in a larger plot.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the potentially suspicious evidence, little is known
about his intentions because Ressam, who is being held in jail, has
declined to cooperate with the authorities. As a result, American
officials are relying on Canadian law enforcement agencies to help
provide insight into Ressam, who lived in Canada until last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was believed to have been accompanied on the ferry from
Victoria, British Columbia, for part of the trip to the United
States by Karim Said Atmani, whom Canadian officials say may have
shared an apartment with Ressam in Montreal. Atmani is believed to
have returned to Canada and left Ressam to complete the journey
alone, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Canadian authorities previously said they had extradited
Atmani to France after he allegedly participated in several
bombings, including one in a Paris subway in 1996, a French law
enforcement official said Monday that Atmani had not been
extradited to France and that there was no information linking him
to the bombing. The French official said Canada had previously
expelled Atmani to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The French official said Ressam and Atmani were both known to
French intelligence and were connected to radical groups he
described as gangster-terrorist organizations. But he said the
French government had no information linking either man directly to
the terrorist operations of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born
militant who is blamed for the bombing of two U.S. embassies in
Africa in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, a spokesman said it was premature to
determine clearly whether Ressam was a member of a known extremist
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they're looking into his motivation, his
intentions, whether he had accomplices and whether he was part of a
wider network and is affiliated with international terrorist
groups,'' said the spokesman, James Foley.

EXPLOSIVES THEFT PROBE FOCUSES ON CREW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 and KERRY FEHR-SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ State and federal investigators are focusing on the
12-man crew of a remote flagstone quarry where a half-ton of
explosives were stolen last week.
</P>
<P>
   Although no conclusions can be drawn yet, authorities say
mounting evidence suggest that the theft of 750 pounds of
fuel-soaked ammonium nitrate, 250 pounds of dynamite, blasting caps
and detonator cord was an inside job.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, investigators want to know why the theft went
unreported until 9:30 a.m. Thursday, more than 36 hours after the
materials were taken from two 4-by-5-foot steel-plated magazines at
the 3 Wins Mining Co. quarry near Drake, about 20 miles southwest
of Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   State mining officials, meanwhile, say similar explosives are
stored at scores of mines around Arizona, and they're often
unguarded in isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, neither the state mine inspector nor the federal Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms knows the quantity and type of
explosives stored by the 87 Arizona mines that use them.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, Coconino County Sheriff Joe Richards showed
reporters photos of the magazines, neither of which had signs of
obvious damage. That weakens or eliminates one working theory of
mine experts: that thieves used acetylene cutting torches.
</P>
<P>
   Each magazine has two locks inside deep cylinders in the doors.
Owners of other flagstone operations in the area say that keys
generally are given to the top two or three company officials in
each operation.
</P>
<P>
   Richards refused to comment on whether keys had opened the
locks.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the company that supplied explosives to the
3 Wins quarry said the locks were cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite unusual for someone to go in and tip over
magazines and snip the locks and take everything that was in
there,'' said Jay Anderson of Dyno Nobel Americas in Salt Lake
City.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said deputies found tracks of a vehicle believed to
have been used in the theft. The tracks were about a mile from the
magazines and went around a locked gate at the entrance to the
quarry.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are offering a reward of up to $10,000 for
information to help crack the case. Richards said the investigation
includes 25 officers from sheriff's departments in Coconino,
Yavapai and Mohave counties, along with ATF agents.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have fanned out to Chino Valley, Paulden, Ash Fork
and surrounding areas, circulating fliers with reward information
in both English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Richards said officers had received a number of tips that
militia members living in the Paulden and Chino Valley areas could
have been involved in the theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the militia cells are there, but we have nothing
substantive to suggest that they were involved in this,'' Richards
said. ``We certainly don't want to cause any panic by leading
anyone to believe that organized militias have anything to do with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   State mining officials say they aren't sure how much explosives
are stored around the state, but they know there's plenty of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very common products that they're using for earth
removal with rock,'' said Phil Howard, the state's assistant mine
inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Although mines must pass yearly safety inspections, smaller
operations are more likely than big players to be vulnerable to
theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of mining, that's a small amount,'' Howard said of
the amount stolen last week. ``But in terms of what it can do,
that's a lot of damage.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, such materials are good for only one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any other use for it than to use it as
an explosive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got us all on pins and needles. We don't know if people
know how to use this energy right, and that's very worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   About 350 mines are active in Arizona, and 87 of them use
explosives. But Howard said it's unclear how many of those store
explosives on site or how many of them employ guards to thwart
would-be thieves.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal laws require that explosives be stored in
padlocked metal magazines that are resistant to weather erosion,
fire, bullets and theft.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a state mine inspector cited 3 Wins for four
violations. The citation, which did not carry a fine, included two
safety infractions dealing with the explosives magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The violations were quickly corrected and the quarry has not
been cited since.
</P>
<P>
   Howard agreed that the theft seems like an inside job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody knew it was out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be crazy to steal that stuff because you do not
want the ATF after you, I guarantee that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was some good ol' boys that wanted to make a big blowup
for New Year's, man, they're going to be behind bars by the time
this thing is through.''
</P>
<P>
   Mine operators are responsible for maintaining an inventory of
their explosives, with permits to store them coming from the state
mine inspector.
</P>
<P>
   The federal ATF issues licenses to detonate the explosives. The
ATF on Monday could not provide a list of mines that store
explosives on site or the quantity they keep on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Although explosives suppliers generally run background checks on
customers who buy their explosives, Arizona is more lax about mine
operations than other states. For example, no state agency is
responsible for licensing blasters, and all that's required to buy
explosives is a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   California, by contrast, oversees blasters through its state
worker safety agency. Those who detonate explosives must have three
years of experience, 20 to 40 hours of training and pass both
written and oral tests.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, of the state Mine Inspectors Office, said he and others
pushed for similar requirements in Arizona during the past
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never even made it to committee,'' he said, adding, that
critics ``tended to say we were just bureaucrats generating more
work for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the recent theft, Howard said his office plans to lobby
for tighter rules again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like this may be the opportunity,'' he said. &QL;
