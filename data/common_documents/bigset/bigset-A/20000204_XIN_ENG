<HEADLINE> Pakistan Said to Have Enough Wheat to Meet Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has enough wheat
stock to meet domestic consumption this year and has, in fact,
reduced its imports to 1.6 million tons from the projected figure
of 2 million tons for the year 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
"There is no wheat shortage in the country," Minister for Food
and Agriculture Shafqat Ali Jamote said at a press briefing on
Thursday. "The country has enough stock to see us through the next
season and even beyond."
</P>
<P>
"The import of wheat was mainly to take care of the buffer
stock to meet any untoward situation, otherwise we did not need to
import it," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
It was projected in June-July 1999 that 2 million tons of wheat
would be imported.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, "When we worked out through an
analysis it came to even less than 1.6 million tons."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan imported 2 million tons of wheat in 1998-99.

<HEADLINE> Azeri Sports Minister Hopes for Deal with FIFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijan's sports minister is
to fly to FIFA headquarters to try to strike a last-minute deal to
keep his country in world soccer's governing body, a ministry
spokesman said in Baku, Azerbaijan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said: "On Monday our sports minister Abulfas Garayev will
fly to Zurich where he wants to meet with FIFA President Sepp
Blatter."
</P>
<P>
The Azeris received a letter from FIFA on Wednesday, which
stated that if by 1200 GMT on February 7 they had not settled an
internal row, the country would be suspended from all FIFA
activities.
</P>
<P>
Azeri soccer was split last month after a group of rebels, who
want the current Azerbaijan soccer federation (ASF) head to step
down, formed their own domestic soccer body.
</P>
<P>
The group, led by the powerful presidents of eight leading
clubs, and with Garayev's backing, have refused to compromise with
the ASF and have elected Alikper Mamedov as their head.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA chief, who has backed the current ASF head, said last
week his body would have no choice but to ban Azerbaijan if the
standstill continued.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemeni Minister of Oil and Mineral Resources Mohammad
al Khadem al-Wajih said Yemen's oil output surged from 428,000
barrels per day (bpd) late 1999 to 437,000 bpd in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
The average oil production last year was near 400,000 bpd, 70,
000 of which were locally consumed while the remaining portion was
shared between the government and the producer companies.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil revenue of the country in 1999 was about 1 billion U.
S. dollars as compared to less than 500 million dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- Oman is expected to build its second oil refinery in
the northern Sahar region at a cost of about 750 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the project said the government is to
own 80 percent of the output of the refinery while the remaining
quota is to be handled by the Omani Oil Company.
</P>
<P>
The construction scheme is to kick off in early 2002 while
actual operation is expected to start in early 2004, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The government is also planning to build a third refinery in the
southern Salala region.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Statistics of the Reserve Bank of the United Arab
Emirates registered a 3.36 percent drop in national banks' net
profits to 862 million dollars in l999 from 888.706 million dollars
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The decline is mainly attributed to the rise in dead loan caused
by major merchants' fleeing the country.
</P>
<P>
Some financial sources said this was the first time for the UAE
Reserve Bank to announce its figures at such an early date.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish Director General of Electricity Production
and Distribution Inc. (TEAS), Muzaffer Selvi, said on Friday that
Turkey will have to increase the import of electricity to meet the
rising domestic demand, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Selvi said at a press briefing that TEAS maintains agreements
with Iran and Bulgaria on purchase of electricity, but so far no
deal has been made between Turkey and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Turkey plans to increase the purchase of
electricity to 20 million kilowatt-hours from Bulgaria and hope to
double the amount of electricity purchase from Iran.
</P>
<P>
He added that Syria is also on the purchasing list.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Attacks British Threat on Decommissioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
said on Friday that British threats to suspend Northern Ireland's
two-month-old power-sharing coalition government undermined his
efforts to defuse a crisis over guerrilla disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Adams told a news conference in Belfast that remarks by
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson in a statement to the
British parliament on the arms row were disgraceful, the Reuters
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said Mandelson's threat on Thursday to suspend the coalition
of pro-British Protestants and pro-Irish Roman Catholics, had
absolutely undermined his talks with the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson gave the IRA a week to make clear it was ready to
disarm, a move which Adams said had no legal basis in the 1998
Good Friday accord.
</P>
<P>
Adams said he believed the disarmament issue could be resolved
but made it clear the IRA would not jump to deadlines.

<HEADLINE> President Clinton Criticizes House-passed Bill on Taiwan Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Friday reiterated his opposition to a House-passed bill aimed
at beefing up U.S. military ties with Taiwan, saying that it would
have a "boomerang effect" and diminish the island's security.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act adopted by the
House of Representatives on Tuesday, which has aroused "utmost
indignation" among the Chinese people, Clinton said, "They (the
Chinese) don't like it, but I don't support the bill either."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's in Taiwan's best interest," Clinton said on
NBC's "Today".
</P>
<P>
"Passing a big, new, sweeping bill like this is not well-
advised and will complicate our long-term task and may well have
the boomerang effect of putting Taiwan under greater pressure," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a one-China policy but we believe that the resolution
of disputes between Taiwan and China ought to be done by peaceful
means and through dialogue," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
But he also alleged that U.S. defense assistance to Taiwan
should be governed by the Taiwan Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Relations Act, which passed the Congress in 1979
after the United States established diplomatic relations with
China, has long been denounced by Beijing for its interference
with China's internal affairs with an attempt to keep Taiwan
separated from the mainland for good.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's remark is the latest in his administration's strong
attack against the Taiwan-related bill, which called for closer
military-to-military ties between Washington and Taipei. Earlier,
National Security Advisor Berger and some other officials voiced
opposition to the legislation and threatened to veto it once it
goes to the president in its current form.

JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Britain
have agreed to send senior officials to meet twice annually in a
bid to plan specific steps of cooperation on bilateral and
international issues, South African Press Association reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by South African Deputy Minister of
Foreign Affairs Aziz Pahad and visiting British Foreign Minister
for Africa Peter Hain.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also agreed to establish a bilateral forum
later this year.
</P>
<P>
The forum, which is to be chaired by South African President
Thabo Mbeki and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, will focus on
cooperation between the two countries in the areas of trade and
investment, education, safety and security.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also reached consensus on pushing forward the
peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and obeying
the United Nations resolution of imposing strict sanctions against
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Hain arrived in South Africa last Saturday for an eight-day
official visit.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Airstrikes Leave 8 Injured in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese guerrilla commander
and seven civilians, including a mother and her 2-year-old
daughter, were injured Friday when Israeli helicopters fired
missiles at a village in south Lebanon, Lebanese security officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The attack came hours after the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army
(SLA) militia abandons a peak outpost in the Israeli-occupied zone
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The name of the commander of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, and the extent of his injuries were not immediately
known.
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh straight day that Israel pounded suspected
guerrilla hideouts and villages in south Lebanon. Israel stepped up
attacks in retaliation for the killings of three Israeli soldiers
and an SLA top commander in the region recently by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim to protect its northern territories
from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese guerrilla groups, spearheaded by Hezbollah, have been
fighting to oust the Israeli occupation troops and its ally, the
SLA, from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Russia Approves Draft of New Military Doctrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday approved a
draft new military doctrine that incorporates changes over the
past few years in the North Caucasus regions and in NATO policies.
</P>
<P>
The top Security Council passed the document at a meeting
chaired by Acting President Vladimir Putin, Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
At Security Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov's suggestion, the
meeting's participants, representing all of the key organizations
and departments, were given two months to finalize the draft
military doctrine, after which the president will sign a decree
introducing the new doctrine, the Interfax news agency quoted
Sergeyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
Valery Manilov, the first deputy chief of the Russian Armed
Forces General Staff who is a key drafter of the document, said
last month that the new doctrine "clearly and distinctly" viewed
nuclear armaments as a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has the right to use nuclear armaments exclusively in
case of an aggression against itself and its allies and only when
it is impossible to prevent by conventional means the liquidation
of Russia as a subject of international relations, a sovereign
entity in these relations," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
"Only in that case Russia will have to use nuclear armaments,"
Manilov said. "Russia will never use nuclear armaments if there is
no aggression against it."
</P>
<P>
Russia's current military doctrine, which was approved on
November 2, 1993, "did not announce a possibility of using nuclear
armaments so distinctly and firmly," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
In stead, it just outlined conditions under which nuclear arms
shall not be used, he said, adding that those conditions remain
valid under the new doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Russia will not use nuclear arms against signatory states to
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of July 1, 1968 that does not
have nuclear armaments, with the exception of two circumstances:
</P>
<P>
-- An armed attack at Russia, its territory, Armed Forces and
other troops or its allies by a country, which has a union
agreement with a nuclear power;
</P>
<P>
-- Joint moves of such a country and a nuclear power to invade
or to make an armed attack at Russia, its territory, Armed Forces
and other troops or its allies or to support such actions.
</P>
<P>
Opening Friday's Security Council session, Putin said the
revision of the old military doctrine was prompted by changes in
Russia and around the world in general.
</P>
<P>
Russia cannot "remain indifferent" to these changes, Putin said,
citing new threats that require new avenues of military
development.
</P>
<P>
"What is going on in the North Caucasus does not only concern
Russia," Putin said, referring to the federal troops' campaign to
root out rebels from the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"We know what problems Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan
are facing these days," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Moscow "cannot help noticing changes in the
strategy of NATO," which in fact has become capable of making
decisions without U.N. sanction, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"We must react appropriately" to all these changes in order to
avoid "running into surprises," Putin said.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Quits U.S. Republican Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. conservative activist
Gary Bauer dropped out of the presidential race Friday after
finishing the last in the New Hampshire Republican Party primary.
</P>
<P>
Bauer, who became the sixth Republican to quit the contest,
declined to make any endorsement of the remaining candidates.
</P>
<P>
Bauer's departure leaves four others to battle for the
Republican Party's nomination. In addition to Texas governor
George W. Bush and Arizona senator John McCain, publisher Steve
Forbes and former ambassador Alan Keyes also are running for
office.
</P>
<P>
Bauer ran as a social conservative, denouncing abortion and gay
rights, but he was competing with Forbes and Keyes for the votes
of Christian conservatives and was never able to break out.
</P>
<P>
Before running for president, Bauer was head of the Family
Research Council, an influential conservative group based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Bush is the front-runner among the remaining Republican
contenders, but is facing a strong challenge from McCain, who won
the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey senator Bill
Bradley are the two major Democratic presidential candidates.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Turkey Sign Five Cooperation Pacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Turkey signed here
Friday five agreements for bilateral cooperation between the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The accords were signed by Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou and his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem, who arrived
here Thursday evening for an official three-day visit, the first
by a Turkish foreign minister in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral agreements focus on science and technology,
cooperation in sea transports, heightened economic cooperation,
education and culture as well as a pact on establishing a
framework to avoid customs violations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are now continuing their talks to finalize an
agreement on the avoidance of double taxation. Other areas
discussed included cooperation in the energy sector and the
possible linking of natural gas networks, along with the
scheduling of various joint trade and economic cooperation
seminars in the next two months in Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
According to Papandreou, an agreement over embassies is
imminent and discussions are underway over opening a Greek
consulate in the Black Sea city of Trabzon.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey had already signed last month four agreements
for bilateral cooperation on tourism, investment, security and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have closely gone to war
three times in the past 26 years over their territorial dispute in
the eastern Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem, but the two
countries have since last June taken positive steps to improve the
strained relations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Dips to 4 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. unemployment rate fell
to a 30-year low of 4 percent in January, the Labor Department
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said January's rate was down from a 4.1 percent rate
in December, the lowest level since a 3.9 percent rate in January
1970. The January improvement reflected strong job growth in the
service sector, construction and in business services. Even
employment at factories, which have been shedding jobs, increased.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy entered 107 months of uninterrupted economic
growth on Tuesday, the longest expansion in its history, beating
the old mark of 106 months set during the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
In January, the 387,000 jobs employers added to their payrolls,
the biggest gain since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose 0.4 percent to 13.50 dollars in January, the fastest pace
since September. In December, wages grew by 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said January's report would provide the Federal
Reserve with ammunition to raise interest rates again in March.
</P>
<P>
Jobs gains were so widespread that even manufacturing, which
lost 248,000 jobs last year, added 13,000 jobs in January. The
largest increases came from employment in the production of
electrical equipment and motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In construction, a whopping 116,000 jobs were added last month,
the largest gain since February 1984. The service sector, the
driving force of job creation in the United States, added 256,000
jobs in January.
</P>
<P>
Business services added 152,000 jobs with gains reported in
computer and data processing.

<HEADLINE> Russia Conducts Sub-critical Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia conducted a new series of
sub-critical nuclear tests recently in its central testing ground
in Novaya Zemlya, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven experiments, two were conducted on January 8, Tass
said, quoting the press service of the Russian Ministry for Atomic
Energy.
</P>
<P>
Novaya Zemlya is an archipelago in north-central Russia in the
Arctic Ocean between the Barents and Kara Seas.
</P>
<P>
The tests were intended to prove the safety of Russia's nuclear
arsenal, the press service said.
</P>
<P>
Tass did not elaborate on the outcome of the tests, but said
the results were reported to Acting President Vladimir Putin on
Thursday by Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov.
</P>
<P>
According to Tass, the Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces is made
up of three branches -- the Strategic Missile Troops, the Naval
Strategic Forces and the Strategic Aviation Forces.
</P>
<P>
The Strategic Missile Troops, equipped with silo and mobile
launchers, are a key component of the nuclear triad. They have 756
launchers with 3,385 nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
The Naval Strategic Nuclear Forces are composed of 26 strategic
nuclear-powered submarines, including six submarine missile-
carrying cruisers of the Typhoon class, seven of the Dolphin class
and 13 of the Kamar (Squid) class. If fully loaded, these nuclear-
powered submarines can carry up to 440 ballistic missiles with
more than 2,000 warheads.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Most Chinese Celebrate Spring Festival in Traditional Ways (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A survey of 4,058 households in Guangzhou, Shanghai, and six
other major cities show that more than two-thirds of those
questioned said they prefer to spend the Spring Festival together
with their families.
</P>
<P>
Another survey by the Beijing Meilande Information Company
revealed that as high as 83 percent said they will spend the
festival with relatives.
</P>
<P>
Social researchers comment that young people now have less time
tending to their parents on an everyday basis because they are
busying with their own work, so the significance of the Spring
Festival as a time for family reunions is actually stronger now.
</P>
<P>
China is now in a transitional period, said Hang Zhizhong, a
Chinese folk custom scholar, and social customs, including those
that have been followed for thousands of years, are changing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Some customs have disappeared completely and others are simply
ignored, while new ones have formed to replace the old, Han noted.
</P>
<P>
The Spring Festival, an occasion for family reunions,
originated from rituals celebrating the harvest in primitive
society, and one of the earliest Chinese character, "nian,"
meaning year, was shaped like a grain of rice.
</P>
<P>
According to Han, 15 ethnic minority groups, along with the Han
nationality, all celebrate the Spring Festival, as do people in
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Vietnam, and several other Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
The festival is traditionally marked by reunion dinners on the
eve of the lunar new year, spring festival scrolls, New Year
paintings, firecrackers, lantern shows, lion dances, and other
activities.
</P>
<P>
Now, fireworks are banned in some major cities in order to
lessen air and noise pollution and reduce losses and damages
caused by fires started by firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
Hang felt sad that some traditional celebration activities are
disappearing. He said maybe tourist departments can turn these
traditions into tourist attractions, and at least in that way keep
them alive.

<HEADLINE> Most Chinese Celebrate Spring Festival in Traditional Ways (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Songshi smiled with great
satisfaction as his eight-member family of three generations were
having a reunion dinner tonight on the eve of China's traditional
Spring Festival, the Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
After dinner, the family sat chatting and watching the special
programs broadcast live by Central China Television, as Zhou's two
grandchildren played by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Zhou felt very good seeing his whole family together for the
holiday.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, however, Zhou, 58, argued with his daughter on
where to have the family's Spring Festival Eve dinner and how to
spend the week-long holiday.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, a professor at a music college in Wuhan, the capital of
Hubei Province in central China, preferred having dinner at home,
while his daughter insisted on eating at a hotel or restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Finally, they compromised. His daughter agreed to have dinner
at home and Zhou agreed that his daughter, son-in-law, and their
only child could go to Hainan, China's southernmost province, to
spend the Spring Festival holiday.
</P>
<P>
More and more young people these days prefer to travel during
holidays and eat at hotels and restaurants, complained Professor
Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He still hopes his son and daughter will stick with the country
's long-cherished tradition of celebrating the festival together,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhou's son, daughter-in-law, and their child, just
arrived in Wuhan today from Shanghai for the special occasion.
</P>
<P>
Though more younger Chinese now prefer traveling, going to
restaurants, and surfing the Internet during the holidays, a
majority of Chinese people still like to spend the festival in the
more traditional ways.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
expressed Friday its worries about differing declarations made by
Austria whose inclusion of far-rights into the government is
raising havoc in Europe.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the EC, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union (EU), said the official declaration made by the
coalition partners was fully consistent with the fundamental
values of the EU while the same declaration was inconsistent with
an earlier statement by Joerg Haider whose far-right Freedom Party
is joining Wolfgang Schuessel's conservative People's Party in the
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
He said the EC has noted the difference with alert and will
closely follow the development in Austria.
</P>
<P>
He said the EC will take actions in accordance with the
Amsterdam Treaty, hailed as the fundamental rules and principles
of the multi-nation bloc which allows the EU membership voting
rights taken away once the member state in question breaches the
commonly agreed rules and principles, including freedom, democracy
and safeguard of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Austria's 14 European Union allies vowed on Monday to isolate
the Austria if it allows the extreme rightists to join the
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, whose country is
serving the rotating EU presidency, said overnight in Lisbon that
Austria's EU partners had no option but to carry out their threat
of isolation.
</P>
<P>
The 14 other EU member states threatened on Monday not to
promote or accept any bilateral official contacts with Austria at
political level nor will they support Austria in favor of its
candidates seeking positions in international institutions.
</P>
<P>
Austrian ambassadors in EU capitals will remain but only as
technical liaisons, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov urged the United States on Friday to immediately release a
Russian tanker stopped in the Straits of Hormuz by a U.S. Navy
ship.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. guided-missile cruiser, operating as part of an
international patrol in the Gulf of Oman, on Thursday stopped and
boarded the Russian tanker suspected of smuggling Iraqi oil
products.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that Moscow understands the need for controlling
steps to prevent the violation of sanctions against Iraq but that
was no pretext for stopping the tanker and keeping it for such a
long time, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to conduct the necessary investigation, but only
after immediate release of the tanker," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Transport Minister Sergei Frank said Thursday that the
tanker was carrying fuel oil from Iran to various ports in the
United Arab Emirates when it was detained.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry released a statement on the same
day, saying the tanker had not entered Iraq's ports or territorial
waters and that the ship's documents showed the origin point for
its cargo was Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We insist that the United States release the Russian tanker
without procrastination," the statement said.

NEW DELHI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Indian economy is estimated
to grow at a slower pace of 5.9 percent in the 1999-2000 fiscal
year as against 6.8 percent in the 1998-1999 fiscal year mainly
due to a slump in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Organization said Friday that the
country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is projected to decelerate
due to a dismal 0.8 percent growth in agriculture sector as
compared with 7.2 percent last year, despite a seven percent
growth in manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth in 1998-1999 was revised to 6.8 percent from six
percent by the Central Statistical Organization later last month.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Not to Run for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Former Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov announced Friday that he would not run in the
upcoming presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, leader of the Fatherland-All Russia movement, told
the independent NTV station that the decision was made "after a
long deliberation."
</P>
<P>
He originally announced his plan to run on December 17, 1999,
two days before the parliamentary balloting, in an apparent
attempt to win more votes for Fatherland-All Russia.
</P>
<P>
The bloc, however, finished in a disappointing third, trailing
the Communist Party and the pro-Kremlin Unity movement.
</P>
<P>
"I can't conceal from you that it was a hard decision to take,"
Primakov said. "After December 17 when I gave my consent to take
part in the presidential campaign, I received thousands of letters
and telegrams of support. It would seem they must have encouraged
me, but during the Duma election and at its opening session I felt
how far our society is from the civic ideal and real democracy. I
don't think the situation can change in a few months."
</P>
<P>
Primakov was referring to the deal reached between the
Communist Party and Unity on the post of speaker of the State Duma
(lower house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
Fatherland-All Russia and two other minority blocs boycotted
Duma sessions in protest. Following the intervention by Acting
President Vladimir Putin, the three factions decided to end the
boycott and return to Duma sessions next week.
</P>
<P>
Primakov thanked the members of the activists' groups in
different cities for nominating him for president and also
expressed his gratitude to all his supporters.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to stress that my withdrawal from the presidential
campaign doesn't mean I won't give my knowledge and experience to
serve Russia in whatever capacity I may work," Primakov said.

ATHENS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Six people were injured Friday
in a five-vehicle pile-up on the Athens-Lamia national highway
near Malakassa, central Greece.
</P>
<P>
The pile-up involved an inter-city bus, three trucks and a
private car, and the accident caused a traffic jam on the busy
highway linking the capital city of Athens, the semi-official
Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The injured have been hospitalized and the investigation in the
cause of the accident is underway.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russian TV Shows Swap of Reporter for Federal Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian television channels
Friday showed the footage of the exchange of Radio Liberty
correspondent Andrei Babitsky for two Russian soldiers held by
Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Zdanovich, spokesman of the Russian Federal Security
Service (FSB), said the swap was videotaped by Russian security
and police officers.
</P>
<P>
Babitsky, who works for the U.S.-funded radio station, was
detained by federal officers in Chechnya several days ago on
suspicion of participation in illegal armed units.
</P>
<P>
Russian presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky told reporters
Thursday Babitsky had agreed to his exchange for two captured
soldiers, adding that the deal was proposed by the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian officials, Babitsky was detained because
he had no official accreditation to work in Chechnya and was
suspected of "spending time" with rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Thursday the
exchange itself was proof that Babitsky's coverage was aimed at
helping the Chechen war effort.
</P>
<P>
"Babitsky is not (Arnold) Schwarzenegger and he's not a banker,
so they must have valued him for his information, which suggests
that the information he had been supplying was not always
objective, mildly speaking," Sergeyev told ORT television.
</P>
<P>
He also defended the idea of the swap. "I'd trade 10 Babitskys
for one Russian soldier."

the four agreements signed between the two countries in the
Turkish capital of Ankara last month.
</P>

During his three-day visit, Cem will also hold talks with Greek
Prime Minister Costas Simitis and his Greek counterpart George

<HEADLINE> EU Launches Car-Free Day in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission and
nine European Union (EU) countries launched an initiative of car-
free day Friday to raise awareness of the need to change mobility
patterns.
</P>
<P>
The Europe-wide initiative was also aimed at enabling European
citizens to see the benefits of a car-free environment and
allowing local city authorities to test such new transport
concepts as gas buses, electric vehicles and bicycles.
</P>
<P>
The car-free day will fall on September 22 when large parts of
city centers will be established as car-free areas to enable
citizens to find their hometown on foot, by bicycle, by public
transport or via other low- or zero-emission vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Margot Wallstrom, EU commissioner for environment, said the car-
free day was a popular initiative which focuses some of the key
concerns of Europe's citizens.
</P>
<P>
France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Denmark,
Spain and Luxembourg have so far signed the car-free day pledge,
committing themselves to the awareness-arousing campaign.
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys indicated that most Europeans are becoming
increasingly concerned about the air and noise pollution, the
danger and stress caused by traffic, though the number of cars on
the road has kept growing in European cities with a significant
majority of all cars traveling less than five kilometers a day.
</P>
<P>
The environmental department of the European Commission, the
executive body of the 15-nation EU, set up a car-free cities
network with some 70 cities participating in 1994 in a bid to
develop and exchange good practices of sustainable mobility.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a car-free day was observed in 35 French cities while
the car-free campaign was held in 66 French and 92 Italian cities
last year with the participation of an estimated total of 22
million people.

<HEADLINE> China Greeting Last Year of Dragon in 20th Century (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese, who believe they are
descendants of dragons, are greeting the arrival of the last "Year
of the Dragon" in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
This particular year is considered by many here to be the most
auspicious in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac, and it
coincides with the new millennium on the Gregorian calendar.
</P>
<P>
Little did the ancient people in China know that at the end of
their 20th century, a sizable slice of the new generation would
celebrate the holiday surfing the Internet or vacationing in warm
vacation climes abroad.
</P>
<P>
Tradition-minded Chinese may be pleased to hear the outcome of
a recent telephone survey, which shows that nearly 90 percent of
the people polled in six large Chinese cities prefer to celebrate
Spring Festival with their families -- the way it's been done for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
Data collected from the Social Survey Institute of China in six
cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in the south,
shows that 72.6 percent of families questioned preferred to gather
all family members together for this special lunar new year. The
figure is up more than one percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
"Modernization over the past century has changed many
traditions about the traditional Chinese Spring Festival," said
Wang Zhiyuan, a noted scholar with the Academy of Social Sciences,
"but deep in their heart, people are very reluctant to abandon the
old customs."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital of Beijing has enthusiastically displayed
its traditional face: a spate of round red lanterns and designs of
dragons are hanging above and around city streets, in centuries-
old Hutongs, or back alleys, and in front of modern buildings.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the holiday spirit of the Chinese, many foreign
business people have also placed huge dragon figures outside the
shopping malls they financed.

<P>
The traditional paper-cut designs are fashionable once again in
northwest China's Xi'an city, which was the imperial capital of
12 dynasties for 1,100-odd years in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Side-by-side vendors' stands display various paper-cuts of
flowers, trees, animals, and baby silhouettes, which are believed
to bring fortune, and this year's favorite dragon designs. A folk
dance done with dragon lanterns is the rage on the streets.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers, not to miss out on the story opportunities provided
by a Dragon Year, have devoted pages to reminding Chinese of their
5,000-year history of civilization. Articles have been carried
detailing the relationship between the dragon and Chinese culture.
Photos of ancient dragon totems have been published.
</P>
<P>
Dragon, an imaginary symbol created by ancient Chinese, is
believed to be an animal that can summon wind and rain, and fly in
heaven. The dragon has been worshipped throughout history as a
divine incarnation and a symbol of the country's fortune.
</P>
<P>
China was war-torn when the 20th century's first year of dragon
came in 1904. Afterward, the Revolution of 1911, led by Dr. Sun
Yat-sen, overthrew the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) and put an end to
the imperial monarch that had raged for many centuries in China.
With this revolution, the imperial emperors were thus deprived of
their imperial robes with embroidered dragon designs, a symbol of
infinite power.
</P>
<P>
To many Chinese, the most unforgettable dragon year was 1976,
when late Chinese leader Mao Zedong and other founders of New
China passed away one after another. And a devastating earthquake
measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale jolted the city of Tangshan in
north China's Hubei Province and left 240,000 people dead.

Over the past three years, the people in China have experienced
many events, including the return of Hong Kong and Macao, flood
scourges, the NATO-led bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslav
Federation, and the 50th founding anniversary of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
When the Chinese people are embracing the year of dragon
starting from February 5, they are approaching the resolution of
the Taiwan issue, and a crucial year for China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO). The reunification of the
motherland and national rejuvenation are again the most important
topics welcoming the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens in the new year, people are convinced that it
will be the most joyful, prosperous and busiest year of the dragon.
</P>
<P>
Netizens and the media, for the first time, have been busy
producing best-of-the-century lists of Chinese thinkers,
inventions, architecture, books, and musical compositions.
</P>
<P>
Airplanes, trains, and motor vehicles which were oddities early
this century will transport as many as 1.61 billion passengers in
China during the Spring Festival this year.
</P>
<P>
Never before have so many Chinese been free to travel, make
money, spend money, and reunite with their families instead of
fleeing away from wars and famines as they had done in the past
history.
</P>
<P>
And in these leisure hours between feasting on holiday goodies,
it's a good bet that most of China's 300 million-plus TV sets will
be switched on. Chinese people have never had so many channels to
choose from, and special New Year's programs will be aired across
the country from China Central Television (CCTV) and various local
TV stations via satellite.
</P>
<P>
Other forms of recreations will be popular at this Spring
Festival parties, particularly short plays that take jabs at
corruption.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very good time to reflect on the past and place our
hopes on the future of China," said writer Liang Xiaosheng. "The
huge dragon is soaring."

BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China is in a festive mood on
the eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year, with all sorts of
activities going on to celebrate this traditional and most
important holiday for family reunion, which begins in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
In Hainan, China's southernmost province, a serious of cultural
activities are launched to greet the Year of the Dragon, including
lion dancing and lantern shows.
</P>
<P>
Many citizens in Hangzhou, the capital of east China's Zhejiang
Province, are celebrating the festival by sending e-mail cards to
friends and buying books, CDs and VCDs for children and friends as
New Year gifts.
</P>
<P>
People in Nanjing, the provincial capital of Jiangsu Province
in east China, are choosing to have their Spring Festival Eve
dinners at hotels and restaurants this year, and, rather than
delivering gifts to friends and relatives in person, a long-
standing tradition, many folks are simply sending them by mail to
save time in their increasingly busier lives.
</P>
<P>
In north China's Hebei Province, more than 2,000 people are
going abroad for the holidays, and air tickets to southeast Asian
and European countries have all been sold out.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong travel agency and the Hebei Railway Tourism
Development Company have jointly sponsored a special train for a
tour to the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions
during the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
In central Hunan Province, people are busy shopping despite the
cold weather, and department store sales are way up.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Chief Executive Delivers Lunar New Year Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa
Friday delivered a Lunar New Year message to all of the Hong Kong
people.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the HKSAR government, Tung expressed his wish that
Hong Kong would thrive vigorously in the Year of the Dragon.
</P>
<P>
He also wished all the people of Hong Kong a Happy New Year and
that success crown all their endeavors.
</P>
<P>
"Another New Year is dawning, as time passes swiftly by," Tung
said, "in the past, when the Chinese New Year drew near, no matter
where we were, we would always try to return home to see our
parents."
</P>
<P>
"To us, family reunion has always been a bliss," he said. "
Nowadays, we still maintain the fine traditions of Chinese New
Year. As Hong Kong society and lifestyle continue to evolve, some
of our family members may be living, working or studying abroad
and some may be out of town taking a holiday during Chinese New
Year."
</P>
<P>
So it may not always be possible for the whole family to get
together at this blissful time of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, our respect for family values and Chinese
traditions remains unchanged. Wherever we are, we will bring our
good wishes and blessings to members of our family," Tung said.

<HEADLINE> Spring Festival Means Great Fun in Year of Dragon (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Red lanterns are festooned high
along the major thoroughfares of the Chinese capital and the
Chinese character "Dragon" can be seen everywhere along the
bustling streets and alleyways.
</P>
<P>
In the Museum of Chinese History on the Tian'anmen Square,
people are lining up to see an exhibition on the Dragon, the
central symbol of Chinese culture and civilization for thousands
of years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese are celebrating their most important festival of the
year, Spring Festival, the Chinese Lunar New Year, a time for
family reunions and feasts, which begins tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12 animals of the ancient Chinese zodiac, the giant
Dragon is the only one that has never existed on Earth, but is the
most respected and auspicious for Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000, the last year of the second millennium, happens
to be a Dragon Year, and the fifth year of the 12-year cycle
according to Chinese tradition, and is an especially joyful New
Year of week-long holidays.
</P>
<P>
This year, Chinese people are having more fun than ever before
in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, many concerts are being held to entertain local
audiences with traditional Chinese and foreign music, operas, and
songs and ballets, and movie-goers now have the chance to enjoy
watching the latest Hollywood blockbusters as well.
</P>
<P>
As usual, China Central Television (CCTV) is airing a gala of
songs, dances and comedy that is sure to entertain millions of
viewers across the country.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the explosion of the Internet, many of the 8.9
million Chinese surfers are watching the entertainment on CCTV or
other programs by accessing www.cctv.com.cn or www.bta.net.cn.
</P>
<P>
Gong Anbing, a 25-year-old Beijing architect, said he'll watch
the CCTV program via the 'net, even though he has two TVs. "I
just do it for fun," Gong said.

A survey shows that this year only 30 percent of those asked
said they would stick with the traditional "shousui," the others
said they will go to bed much earlier.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, many Chinese are planning to take part in
outdoor activities during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
Traveling to other parts of the country or abroad has
increasingly become an option for urban residents. A staff member
at the China International Travel Agency said that over 3,000
Beijing residents are planning domestic or overseas tours with the
agency.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some elderly folks will visit the various
fairs going on in the city, where cultural performances are held
and special holiday items are sold. "It is a time to renew
traditional city life," said Liu Jiqing, a retired school teacher.
</P>
<P>
Many young people are attracted to things that are new and
exotic. For instance, under the newly built Xidan Cultural Square
there is an underground sports hall where people can climb rocks
or take in a 3-D movie.
</P>
<P>
The National Library remains open to readers during the
holidays, and many avid bookworms are flocking to the two-year-old
Capital Book Plaza, the largest bookstore in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
But most of the Beijingers who come from other provinces have
already returned to their hometowns to spend Spring Festival with
their families.

<HEADLINE> Israel Recalls Ambassador to Vienna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- As decided by his government,
Israeli Ambassador to Vienna Natan Meron has been recalled in
protest against the inclusion of Austrian Freedom Party in the
coalition, said Israeli Foreign Ministry in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meron, who is also non-resident ambassador to Slovakia, is
scheduled to return home on Friday will not be returning to his
post, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"Israel can not remain silent in the face of the rise of
extremist right-wing parties, in particular in those countries
which played a role in the events which brought about the
eradication of a third of the Jewish people in the holocaust," the
ministry added.
</P>
<P>
"This is especially true when parties such as the one led by
Joerg Haider become partners in government," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, with the swear-in of the new Austrian government,
the government of Israel has instructed its ambassador in Vienna,
Mr. Natan Meron, to return home, and as stated in the past, Israel
will reassess its relations with Austria," the statement pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Austria said the right-wing Freedom Party leader
Joerg Haider and Austrian People's Party leader Wolfgang Schuessel
signed a declaration Thursday, renouncing Austria's Nazi past and
affirming their commitment to European values of democracy and
human rights in a bid to alleviate European Union's concern about
the inclusion of the Freedom Party to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Austrian President Thomas Klestil, who approved the formation of
the coalition, swore in on Friday the Austrian new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister David
Levy decided Wednesday to recall Israel's ambassador from Vienna if
Austrian President Klestil approves the planned coalition agreement
which includes the right-wing Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
"Israel views with utmost gravity the inclusion of the extreme
right-ring Freedom Party led by Joerg Haider in the Austrian
government and calls on the international community not to accept
this worrying phenomenon," Barak and Levy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that the inclusion of an extreme
right-wing party, whose leader has previously made serious remarks
regarding the Nazi regime, in the Austrian government must arouse
the attention of the entire free world.
</P>
<P>
"The entire Jewish people, led by the state of Israel, will not
allow the world to ignore events in Austria and their possible
implications," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> New Center to Reduce Congestion in Uganda's Biggest Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
allocated a total sum of 28 million U.S. dollars to Mulago
Hospital, the biggest in the country, to build an assessment
center to reduce congestion in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The center will be an entry point for new patients coming to
the hospital for the first time, hospital director Lawrence Kaggwa
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new patients center will save the first comers much
inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
Patients with minor problems will also be treated at the
center, which will curb congestion at the main hospital, the New
Vision newspaper Friday quoted the director as saying.
</P>
<P>
The center will have a children's emergency ward with a
capacity of 36 beds. However, it can house 40 to 50 beds in case
of emergency.
</P>
<P>
The antenatal clinic is to be shifted to the center. This will
be in addition to a gynecology and obstetrics department at the
new center, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
There will also be X-ray facilities, a laboratory, various
clinics and an admission block at the main building of the center.
</P>
<P>
Mulago Hospital is run by the government, enjoying the most
advanced medical equipment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Its share of the total health sector budget has risen in the
past three years and this one hospital now accounts for one
quarter of all government recurrent health spending.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) --President Thabo Mbeki
pledged on Friday that the South African government would pay
special attention this year to the quality of management in South
Africa's schools.
</P>
<P>
This was aimed at ensuring a culture of learning and teaching,
 Mbeki said, adding that discipline would be reinculcated
throughout the system.
</P>
<P>
 In his speech at the opening of parliament, Mbeki said the
Tirisano program, launched by Education Minister Kader Asmal,
was an important part of the government's offensive to ensure that
the necessary levels of education and training were developed.
</P>
<P>
All schools should be inspired to copy the example of the
Ithuteng Trust in Soweto, he said.
</P>
<P>
The project involved 1,500 pupils who were not only studying
hard, but also carrying out important voluntary community work,
including educating their peers to turn against crime, rape and
drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki singled out for praise two of the project's leaders --
Mrs Jacky Maarohanye and Dr TW Kambule who devoted their efforts
to education in black townships.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- An European Union
delegation, headed by Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Rino Serri,
is due to meet Ethiopian leaders over the Ethio-Eritrean conflict,
informed sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation will try to help the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) implement its peace plan, said the sources who asked
not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
The exact date of the visit is not officially announced yet.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Ethio-Eritrean border conflict broke out in May
1998, the OAU and the United States have been, among others,
mediating between the warring sides.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the EU delegation leaders had held
discussions with the current chairman of the OAU, Algerian
President Abdul Aziz Bouteflika and the American representatives,
Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice and former Security
Advisor Anthony Lake.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan offered by the OAU include framework agreement,
modalities and technical arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has claimed to accept the OAU's package of peace plan,
while Ethiopia rejected the technical arrangement alleging that it
is inconsistent with the framework agreement and modalities.
</P>
<P>
The coming EU visit aims at playing a constructive role by way
of making the initiative of the OAU to bear fruit in the
settlement of the Ethio- Eritrean conflict, EU officials said.

<HEADLINE> S. African President Urges Greater Efforts to Combat Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki Friday urged all South Africans to intensify their
efforts to combat racism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of Parliament, the president said
people should not reach a premature conclusion that racism in
South Africa was dead after apartheid was brought to an end in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said some South Africans were so determined to close
their eyes to the reality of racism "that those who are forced to
swallow the bitter fruit of racial inequality and arrogance are
regularly rebuked for speaking out against the pain they continue
to endure."
</P>
<P>
South Africans should face the brutality of racism that would
continue to exist "unless everyone engages this monster
consciously and systematically", Mbeki pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that the U.N. Human Rights Commission in the
country would convene a National Congress Against Racism later
this year, according to the South African president.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that this important initiative will help to
move our country faster towards the realization of the goal --
contained in our Constitution -- of the creation of a non-racial
society, as well as impact positively on our continuing struggle
for a non-sexist society," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should give all the necessary support to
ensure the commission succeed in engaging all sectors of society
in the offensive against racism and sexism.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki congratulated members of parliament for the work they had
done to approve, ahead of a constitutional deadline, the Promotion
of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act and the
Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act.
</P>
<P>
"The government will act to ensure the observance of these laws
as part of our common national offensive against all forms of
inequality and discrimination, including racial and gender
inequality and discrimination, as well as discrimination on the
basis of disability," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia: Austrian Government Should Be Judged by Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Friday that the new
Austrian leadership should be judged by its future program and
concrete actions.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Yevgeny Voronin said Moscow
hopes that "Austria will continue making a constructive
contribution to the development of neighborly relations in Europe
on the basis of loyalty to neutrality and will not take steps
wrought with any threat to European stability."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said his ministry "is closely following the
developments in Austria, taking into account the comments of
several countries on the possible outcome of the formation of the
new Austrian cabinet," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Voronin's comment came amid reports that Austrian President
Thomas Klestil is expected to swear in a coalition government that
includes the far-right Freedom Party on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Austria's 14 European Union (EU) allies are expected to stop
promoting or accepting any bilateral official contacts with it at
the political level. The countries will also stop backing Austrian
candidates seeking positions in international institutions.
Austrian ambassadors in the EU capitals will only be received at a
technical level.
</P>
<P>
Joerg Haider, chief of the far-right Freedom Party, was
bitterly criticized in some EU member states for his "insulting,
xenophobic and fascist" statements and conducts.
</P>
<P>
Although Haider himself will not be in the new cabinet, his
party will have six ministers, including the vice-chancellorship
and the finance, defense, justice and social affairs portfolios.

<HEADLINE> Door of German Team Is Opened to Haessler and Moeller, Ribbeck Says  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The headcoach of the German
football national team Erich Ribbeck said that the door of the
national team is always opened to the veteran mid-fielders Thomas
Haessler and Andreas Moeller according to his declaration on a
column of the special magazine "Kicker".
</P>
<P>
Ribbeck said that both players have the chance as any player to
take part in the European Championship in the Netherlands and
Belgium this summer.
</P>
<P>
33-year-old Thomas Haessler and 32-year-old Andreas Moeller
both were the famous mid-fielders of the German national team and
had played very decisive role for the team during the important
games. Moeller withdrew from the national team because of his
serious wound and Haessler left the national team after the
disgraced loss with 0-3 against Croatia in the quarter-final of
the World Cup on July 1998 in France.
</P>
<P>
Haessler only 1.66-meter in height has played 97 matchs for the
German national team and his great wish is also that he can play
for the national team more than 100 times. Moeller has kicked 85
times for the German national team.
</P>
<P>
Ribbeck said that whether both of them can return into the
national team depends on their condition. Now in the German
national team there are no such good mid-fielder as Haessler and
Moeller. It is a big anxiousness of Ribbeck.

<HEADLINE> Modern Recreation Popular in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Bowling, working out in
the gym, and chatting with others anywhere in the world through
the Internet, are becoming favorite pastime activities for people
in the city of Shijiazhuang in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Liu, a teacher at the Hebei Teachers University, said he spends
200 or 300 yuan (24 to 36 U.S. dollars) a month to go bowling
because it is acceptable, and what's more, it's fun.
</P>
<P>
Going shopping used to be the main way to kill the spare time
for city dwellers, but now they have also turned to outings in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Fresh air and serene nature just 20 or 30 km away is appealing
to the people who have been pushed along by the rapid rhythm of
everyday life, and many travelers say they prefer it just for
being away from bustling crowds and skyscrapers along the city
streets.
</P>
<P>
Calling friends now often takes the place of face-to-face
chatting with friends, as people in modern society are busy with
their work, and gatherings at homes is a bother for the hosts.
</P>
<P>
Now, just by tapping a keyboard, greeting messages can be sent
to friends no matter where they are via e-mail, and many can find
a still broader world, and make friends by just sitting in front
of a computer.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet user in Shijiazhuang has increased to
nearly 20,000 from fewer than 8,000 two years ago,thanks to ever-
decreasing Internet fees by which people are now be able to cruise
Internet for 30 hours for only 50 yuan (about 6 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A senior engineer surnamed Jin at the Northern Designing
Institute, has long had the habit of checking for specific
information in his field and on world affairs at nine and ten o'
clock every evening, while his wife seeks stock quotations on the
Internet. This new wonder of the modern age is bringing the whole
world to them, they said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, memberships at local gym clubs in the city have been
on steady rise in the last two years, with a majority of the
members being women for whom 300 yuan (36 US dollars) is quite
cheap if it offers them the bright prospects of becoming slimmer.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Satisfied With Syria's Commitment On PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish State Minister Ramazan
Mirzaoglu has said Syria has abode by the Adana Agreement signed in
October 1998 in the wake of the departure of outlawed Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK)leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ankara was pleased to observe Syria is keeping its promises of
desisting from sheltering PKK terrorists on its soil, commented
Mirzaoglu in an interview with Turkish Daily News, which was
published in the English-language newspaper on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria, who have been at odds for the past nearly 20
years, signed an agreement in Adana, south Turkey, two years ago,
which stipulated that Syria will no longer give shelter to
separatist PKK leader Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The accord has constituted a turning point in the bilateral
relations as both sides try to find common ground to create good-
neighborly ties.
</P>
<P>
Mirzaoglu paid a four-day visit to Damascus last month, the
first by a Turkish minister in five years, thus pushing the bonds
between the two neighbors to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
"I was briefed by our diplomatic staff in Damascus before I held
talks with Syrian officials and they told me that Syria was abiding
by the Adana Agreement so there was no need to raise the issue."
</P>
<P>
The visit took place at a very critical time when the peace
talks were continuing between Israeli and Syrian officials in
Washington and when there was speculation that the issue of
Turkey's water supplies being brought to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the sticky issue of the ever-growing ties between
Israel and Turkey, Mirzaoglu said the Syrian side did not raise the
issue of military agreements signed between Ankara and Tel-Aviv
during his talks in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently they have been convinced that these agreements were
not threatening," he added.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the water issue, Mirzaoglu said the Syrian side
stressed peaceful consultations to have it solved and Turkey agreed
to the Syrian stand.

Tokyo Friday, with the key Nikkei index falling slightly after
topping the 20,000 line at one stage for the first time in more
than 30 months.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japanese Security Officers, Police Inspect Aum Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan's security officers and
police on Friday inspected five premises belonging to the Aum
Shinrikyo (supreme truth) cult under the new anti-Aum law.
</P>
<P>
The Public Security Investigation Agency, aided by police,
searched the cult's facilities in Otawara, Tochigi Prefecture,
where some of Aum founder Shoko Asahara's children live, security
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Other Aum facilities inspected included those in the town of
Sanwa in Ibaraki Prefecture, Koshigaya in Saitama Prefecture,
Minokamo in Gifu Prefecture, and the town of Kosei in Shiga
Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The agency conducted the searches for the first time since its
inception in 1952.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said the government
hopes the inspections will help dispel local residents' concerns
over the presence of Aum in their communities.
</P>
<P>
The agency and police gained permission from the Public
Security Examination Commission to search the Aum facilities under
a law enacted last December to crack down on the cult.
</P>
<P>
The commission allowed the agency to put Aum under surveillance
in collaboration with the police for up to three years.
</P>
<P>
Aum has committed a series of crimes including the 1995 sarin
gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, which killed 12 people and
injured more than 5,000.

<HEADLINE> Measles Kill 100 in Northern Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The measles that broken out
one month ago in Darre Souf district of Samangan province in
northern Afghanistan has now invaded new areas of the district
claiming some 100 lives, a United Nations report said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of the epidemic was first reported at five
villages in the southeast of Darra Souf and in the last two weeks,
the disease has spread to seven new areas, where it has caused 43
deaths, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Darra Souf, home for up to 5,000 families displaced during the
fighting between Afghan warring factions in 1999, is an isolated
area accessible only with donkeys.
</P>
<P>
The response has been complicated by the lack of any district
health infrastructure and the difficult access, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the World Health Organization and the United Nations
Children's Fund have managed to send some medical supplies and
medical personnel into the area.
</P>
<P>
The team will treat the acute respiratory infections that are
complications of the disease, and will provide Vitamin A to
enhance immune response and decrease complications and fatalities,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Urges Cote d'Ivoire to Speed UP Transition Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Thursday urged the Ivorian military leader, Gen. Robert
Guei, to speed up his transition program to civilian rule in line
with the expectation of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after Guei's one-day visit to Nigeria Wednesday,
Obasanjo said in Nigeria's capital Abuja that: "We have listened
to him and we have offered our advice." according to the Pan
African News Agency (PANA) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The military government, that toppled President Henri Konan
Bedie on December 24, has announced a transition
timetable-terminating end of October.
</P>
<P>
This was after the take-over had been widely condemned by the
UN, OAU and the Economic Community of West African States, which
has demanded a hand-over to elected civilians by June.
</P>
<P>
Without endorsing Guei's timetable, Obasanjo asked him to
ensure free, fair and transparent elections, whose results would
be acceptable to all Ivorians and the international community.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the junta to show neutrality in the transition
process.
</P>
<P>
Answering reporters' question, Guei pledged to keep to the
transition program.
</P>
<P>
But he parried the question on whether or not he would run for
president as being speculated.
</P>
<P>
Guei described the change of government as a "revolution" and
not a coup.
</P>
<P>
He therefore, called for international support to see through
his transition program.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China's largest life insurance
company, China Life, reported a premium income of 60.3 billion
yuan in 1999, up 14 percent from 1998, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, China Life had assets worth of 126.1
billion yuan, which is 29.6 billion yuan more than the figure of
1998.
</P>
<P>
Company officials said the growth was achieved despite a tight
macro-economy, relatively weak market demand and fiercer
competition from other insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xianzhang, the newly-appointed general manager of China
Life, noted that the company would focus in 2000 on improving the
quality of its staff, setting up a strict and efficient inside-
control system and using more advanced technologies.
</P>
<P>
China Life split from the former People's Insurance Company of
China (Group) and changed to its current name in early 1999. It is
the largest state-owned commercial insurance company in China.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Warns Traders Against Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary Manuel Roxas II of the Department of Trade and
Industry said in a radio interview that government teams are now
monitoring public markets to make sure prices of basic commodities
remain stable.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to monitor prices. We will report to the public
any violation of the policy," Roxas said.
</P>
<P>
He said many of inspectors are deployed in wet markets, adding
that the government earlier received a commitment from
supermarkets and groceries that they would not raise the prices of
basic goods.
</P>
<P>
According to Roxas, oil accounts for only a small portion of
the local production cost of manufacturing plants, which means
that prices of basic goods are basically not affected by any fuel
price adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The strong "brand-to-brand" competition among manufacturers and
the highly price-sensitive attitude of low-income consumers would
also pressure manufacturers to keep their prices stable.
</P>
<P>
Oil firms raised prices of petroleum products this week, saying
they can no longer afford to maintain oil prices at present level
because of the rising world prices of crude oil.

<HEADLINE> British Official Criticizes EU Stance on Trade Deal With S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Foreign
Affairs Minister for Africa Peter Hain Thursday strongly
criticized the European Union's reluctance to honor its trade deal
with South Africa because of disagreement over the use of the wine
brands.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint meeting of Parliament's foreign affairs and
trade and industry portfolio committees, Hain said the bickering
over the agreement was unacceptable, stressing that the deal
should be kept as intact as possible.
</P>
<P>
EU and South Africa signed a deal to liberalize trade between
the two sides last year and were expected to implement the deal by
January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
But Greece and Italy raised their objection to South Africa's
use of " ouzo" and "grappa" as the brands for South African wines
and spirits, claiming the brands belong to Greece and Italy only.
Because of their objection, the implementation of the trade deal
has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
Hain, who was born and grew up in South Africa, arrived in the
country Saturday on an eight-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The British official said EU members were "acting like a
narrow, selfish club".
</P>
<P>
It was in Europe's interests to have a thriving South Africa,
Hain noted, describing South Africa as "an extremely important
global player".
</P>
<P>
He said President Thabo Mbeki's African renaissance concept was
seen by the United Nations Security Council as a very important
step towards stabilizing the continent.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian-hired cargo
plane crashed into Lake Victoria on Thursday evening after failure
to land at an airport in the country's northwestern Mwanza Region,
a Tanzanian newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
All five passengers and crew on board survived the crash that
took place at around 7:30p.m., "The African" reported.

The aircraft belonged to Trans-Arabia Airline of Sudan, the
police commander said.
</P>
<P>
It was one of the three planes hired to collect fish fillet
from Mwanza for export to Europe.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Launch National Plan Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
unveil its five-year national plan on the fight against HIV/AIDS
by April, Minister of State in the President's Office Marsden
Madoka said.
</P>
<P>
The National AIDS Strategic Plan will spell out priority areas
and roles of all sectors in combating the scourge, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The plan, to be effective from July 1 this year to June 30,
2005, will also indicate the expenditure for the program, Madoka
told the first meeting of the National AIDS Control Council
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the implementation of anti-AIDS
activities will now shift to ministries, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), religious groups and community-based
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Health will now focus on medical aspects of
the epidemic, including provision of care to affected people," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the first AIDS case was detected in Kenya in 1984, the
east African country has spent about 10 billion U.S. dollars in
direct and indirect costs.
</P>
<P>
The infection rate of HIV/AIDS has jumped to 10 percent in
Kenya. So far, no signs show the alleviation of the scourge,
which currently claims 500 lives a day in the country.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Suffers Per Capita Income Contraction: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is among the seven
countries in sub-Saharan region that suffered a contraction of
more than one percent in per capita income in the latter part of
the 1990s, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said.
</P>
<P>
Other countries include Burundi, the Comoros, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Guinea Bissau and Sierra Leone,
IMF World Economic Outlook Report said.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the fall in per capita income to the
civil strife that has engulfed the region, according to Friday's
Times of Zambia newspaper.
</P>
<P>
However, some other countries in the region including Angola,
Ethiopia, Mozambique and Rwanda registered per capita income
growth exceeding three percent.
</P>
<P>
The report explains that war-torn countries like Angola
experienced growth largely due to a level of recovery from armed
conflict.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Troops in Kisangani on Full Alert: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda People's Defense
Forces deployed in Kisangani, the third largest city in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), have been put on full
alert since mid-January when Zimbabwean and DRC troops recaptured
Ikela some 300 kilometers south of the city.
</P>
<P>
All the Ugandan soldiers there have been on alert following the
latest development, State Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma told
Xinhua on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The DRC government troops and the rebels were fighting at the
outskirts of the war-ravaged city, according to traders in
Kisangani where the Ugandan troops are based.
</P>
<P>
Kavuma said that if DRC President Laurent Kabila and his allied
forces want to fight towards Kisangani, he will merely be
provoking the Ugandan troops to fight in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan troops in Kisangani reserve the right to fight back
if attacked, the Ugandan official warned, adding that it was bad
for Kabila's forces to fight because it went against the Lusaka
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Uganda sent troops into the DRC to allegedly protect its
borders soon after the civil war broke out in the country in early
August of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The main players in the armed conflict signed a peace agreement
in Lusaka in July and August last year, ushering in new hope for
ending the war in the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement has not been effectively implemented
and it is faltering with fighting still going on in the vast
central African country.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Central Bank Injects $28M to Save Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Uganda has injected
28.2 U.S. million dollars into the foreign exchange market to
stabilize the Ugandan shilling since the beginning of the new
year.
</P>
<P>
The intervention is necessary to relieve pressure on the
shilling and to maintain market stability, according to a press
release from the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Over the past month, shilling fell by four percent against
dollar, prompting local residents to save dollars instead of the
shillings.
</P>
<P>
"The bank will continue to monitor market developments and
stands ready to intervene when market behavior warrants," said the
press release available Friday.
</P>
<P>
The shilling depreciated sharply against dollars recently
because Uganda' s export of coffee has been waning due to coffee
wilt.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is the east African country's biggest foreign exchange
earner, accounting for 60 percent of Uganda's total foreign
exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
At a recent press conference, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
admitted that shrinking coffee exports, European Union's fish ban
and bad investment environment are to blame for the current fall
of shilling.
</P>
<P>
EU's fish ban makes Uganda lose 60 million dollars annually,
the president said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Developing the West -- the Right Move at the Right Time (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Developing the resource-rich
western areas has become a set policy of the Chinese government in
the near future, as economists here say that in the global context
the time is right, and domestically the country is ready.
</P>
<P>
Since President Jiang Zemin first proposed the idea in early
1999, the west-development strategy was a focus of policy
discussions at the national economic conference late last year and
again at the State Council's special conference on the development
of the vast western region last January. Policy-makers at both the
central and local levels have reached consensus on the point.
</P>
<P>
Late Chinese leader and the architect of China's reform Deng
Xiaoping expressed his vision of regional economic development in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Deng said that in the initial stage of China's development, the
middle and western regions would have to support the opening and
growth of the coastal regions. In the second stage, when the
coastal regions have gained strength, it would be their turn to
help the middle and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Now it's their turn.
</P>
<P>
After two decades of fast growth, the Chinese economy is
witnessing a deflationary trend. It is now possible for the state
to spend more of the resources accumulated over the past two
decades on developing the west, while it pursues a proactive
fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, the minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, said the government will draft more
preferential policies this year to attract foreign investment to
the western region, and will use more international loans and
treasury bonds on projects in the west.
</P>
<P>
He also added that a separate outline for western development
would be incorporated in China's next five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, is drafting a special credit policy for the western
region, while the State Development Bank has recently strengthened
its presence in the west by opening several new branches in the
region.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Developing the West -- the Right Move at a Right Time (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years, the development of the Chinese economy has
been restricted by weak domestic demand. And a large proportion of
capital, technology and labor resources have been seeking new
production fields, new markets and new spaces for development.
</P>
<P>
But the west, with its vast land area and rich resources, can
offer huge investment opportunities, market and development
potential, the experts emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Developing the west would create plenty of room for China's
economic restructuring and industrial upgrading, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that developing the west at this time is a
never-before-seen chance, as China has basically solved the rice
problem for its huge population and has a rare over-supply of
grain.
</P>
<P>
The ecological environment in the west has been devastated by
generations of deforestation done to make way for new farmland.
Now it's time to revert some of the farmland into forests and
grassland.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, improving the ecological environment in the
west will greatly improve the production environment in the Yellow
River and Yangtze River valleys and hence increase production,
while the western region will gain time to readjust their
agricultural structure for the benefit of the local people.
</P>
<P>
Now that China is beginning a new stage in its opening to the
outside world as a result of the breakthrough in its bid for
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the time has
never been better for the west to use foreign investment and
develop their export-oriented industries. Added to that, they have
the model of the coastal regions to follow.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has correctly taken advantage of the
chance to develop the west. Senior leaders made several
investigation tours of the landlocked region and pinpointed
infrastructure, ecological environment protection and industrial
restructuring as the keys to the success of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the government's actions have been proper and
illustrate a clear understanding of specific problems. They said
that with the concerted efforts of the central government, the
western and eastern regions, the chance for the success of the
west development strategy is high.

BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Red Cross Society of China

<P>
During November 1999-January 2000, Yunnan Province, in
southwest China, Liaoning Province, in the northeast, and Shanxi
Province, in the north, were jolted by earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The RCSC turned to the International Federation of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies for help, and the money was remitted to
the Chinese organization Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The RCSC distributed the money to the local Red Cross societies
of the three affected provinces, asking them to purchase daily
necessities with the international donations to help the
earthquake victims enjoy the upcoming Spring Festival, the Chinese
lunar new year, which falls on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> EU Members Expected to Act Against Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Austria's 14 European Union (
EU) allies are expected to turn against the country on Friday,
which will swear in a coalition government incorporating the far-
rights.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, who holds the union's rotating presidency, reaffirmed
in Lisbon that the measures jointly decided by the 14 EU member
states will take effect on Friday.
</P>
<P>
These countries agreed to isolate Austria by not promoting or
accepting any bilateral official contacts with Austria at
political level, nor will they support Austria in favor of its
candidates seeking positions in international institutions while
the Austrian ambassadors in EU capitals will only be received at a
technical level.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said overnight in
Lisbon that Austria's EU partners has no option but to carry out
their threat of isolation after Austrian President Thomas Klestil
said he will swear in the coalition government between the
conservative People's Party and the far-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation EU,
however, said that it has no immediate comment on how it will
react.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the commission said that it will guard the EU treaties
should the Austrian coalition breach the fundamental principles of
the treaties.
</P>
<P>
The commission press service said that the commission will
follow carefully developments in Austria and that it urged
Austria to apply all EU rules and laws fully and properly.
</P>
<P>
Joerg Haider, chief of the far-right Freedom Party, was
bitterly criticized in some EU member states for his "insulting,
xenophobic and fascist" statements and conducts.
</P>
<P>
Although Haider himself will not be in the new cabinet but his
party will have six ministers, including the vice-chancellorship
and the finance, defense, justice and social affairs portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Belgium has warned that it will be a dangerous precedent to
incorporate the extreme rightists into any EU government.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the European Parliament, the legislative body of
the EU, adopted a strongly-worded resolution against Austria.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted with 406 votes for, 53 against and 60
abstentions, called upon the European Commission and the European
Council of Ministers to suspend Austria if there are any serious
and persistent breaches of EU principles.
</P>
<P>
The resolution condemned all the xenophobic and fascist
statements made by Haider in the past year and described the
admission of his party into the coalition government as factually
legitimating the extreme rightists in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Chinese to Celebrate Festive, Frosty New Year (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- People in most parts of China
won't be celebrating Spring Festival, the Chinese lunar new year
holiday, under blue skies on February 5.
</P>
<P>
The latest forecast from the China Central Meteorological
Station predicts clouds, rain and sleet will likely usher in the
day in south China, and snow is expected in the north.
</P>
<P>
And the temperature in Beijing, the capital city, will hover at
0 to 5 degrees Celsius, with lows dropping to -5.
</P>
<P>
Most of China was hit with an unusually cold January; the
average temperature in Beijing last month was -6.7 degrees, the
coldest for the month since 1977, and 2 degrees lower than normal.
In Shenyang, in northeast China's Liaoning province, the mercury
was four degrees lower than average.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists here have pointed out that La Nina is the cause
of the freezing weather. Warm waters from the eastern Pacific
Ocean turned cold when lower-than-usual temperatures at the
equator met with frequent cold currents moving south from Siberia,
resulting in heavy snow in northern China and rain in the southern
part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Xu Liangyan, an employee of China's National Climate Center,
said that the average temperature for southwest China's Yunnan
Province in the last ten days of January was three to four degrees
lower than in a normal year.
</P>
<P>
And a blizzard there on January 30, the heaviest since 1983,
dropped 30 centimeters of snow and pulled temperatures down below
zero in the subtropical province.
</P>
<P>
Kunming, the provincial capital, is known as China's "Spring
City" for its year-round mild climate and annual average
temperature of 14.5 degrees Celsius. The city hosted the 1999
International Horticultural Exposition.

Residents of Nanning in south China's usually-warm Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region were startled to see snow on January 30;
the local meteorological bureau received calls from many skeptical
citizens asking if the snow was real.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the meteorological bureau of Jilin, one of the
coldest provinces in China, show that the province's average
temperature for the first 24 days of January was 18 degrees below
zero, and bitterly cold lows of -30 degrees were reported.
</P>
<P>
Snow fell on Shenyang of neighboring Liaoning Province for
eight days straight at the start of January. "This is the coldest
winter I have ever seen. I am just a little bit unused to it,"
said a shivering man surnamed Wang in his fifties, who works for
the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
This year's midwinter has re-introduced many southerners in
China to the kind of cold temperatures they haven't known in 13
years of warm winters. Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Guangxi
all saw frost and snow.
</P>
<P>
Local merchants say the only thing that's hot are sales of
eiderdown coats and electric heaters, especially in the south.
</P>
<P>
The cold weather still cannot keep Chinese from traveling,
either back home from their working places or to some tourist
attractions, to spend the seven-day holiday.
</P>
<P>
Transportation supervision departments report a total of 1.61
billion people are planning to travel in spite of the cold. Many
have targeted Australia and southeast Asia as the perfect vacation
destinations.

<HEADLINE> Private Aviation Sprouting in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 4 (Xinhua)-- Owning a car is not the only
desire of Chinese these days. There are now many who also want to
pilot a private airplane.
</P>
<P>
A training program for individual pilots is now ready to get
underway in Shanghai, the most prosperous city in China, and
qualified trainees will receive pilot's licenses from the General
Administration of Civil Aviation of China, said Zhang Feng, the
manager of Shanghai Eastern Airlines Training Co. Ltd..
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people, including private entrepreneurs,
employees of foreign enterprises, and high-level managers, have
applied to join the training course since it was announced on
January 8, said Zhang, and many more came for more information.
</P>
<P>
The demanding training course includes 80 hours of theoretical
lessons and about 40 hours of flying. It will takes two months at
most to complete the entire training process and final test, at a
cost of about 80,000 yuan (more than 9,600 U.S. dollars), airline
company officials revealed.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that two U.S-made Cessna-172 light planes valued at
150,000 U.S. dollars each, will be used for student flying, and
the first plane has already arrived in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yue, general manager of Yuanda Group, a giant air-
conditioner producer in China, was among the first group of
Chinese people to buy a private plane. Now he owns four, one jet
aircraft from Cessna and three Bell helicopters.
</P>
<P>
"I can fly any places I want," said Zhang. "With these
airplanes, my work becomes more efficient".
</P>
<P>
There are 41 people in China with private pilot licenses, all
since August 1996 when the country approved such applications.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed in Guerrilla Attacks in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Four people were killed
Thursday in ultra-leftist-related activities in Nepal's mid-
western districts, where the leader of the ruling party is
visiting for a solution of the guerrillas' movement, according to
reports reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Police Office chief said two members of the ruling
Nepali Congress were killed by the guerrillas on their way to
attend a mass meeting addressed by NC President Girija Prasad
Koirala in Rukum district.
</P>
<P>
Police said the two NC members were warned by the guerrillas
not to attend the mass meeting and were hacked to death when they
defied the warning.
</P>
<P>
Koirala left for the guerrillas-affected areas in mid-western
Nepal Tuesday for a peaceful solution of the four-year guerrilla
movement. About 1,100 people, including policemen, guerrillas
members and civilians, have died.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two guerrillas members were killed in a cross-fire
with police in Kalikot district Thursday, according to another
report.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Central Bank to Adopt Tight Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia's Central Bank (
BI) will adopt a tight monetary policy in a bid to arrest the fall
of the flagging rupiah against the U.S. dollar, a BI official said.
</P>
<P>
A tighter money policy was probably unavoidable after the
United States increased its interest rates, local leading
newspapers Friday quoted the bank's deputy governor Miranda
Goeltom as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have to do something or the market will punish us," she
said. But she added that it was too early to say whether the
central bank would immediately raise its benchmark interest rate.
</P>
<P>
She said the monetary tightening policy would definitely slow
the central bank's intention to cut the interest rate of Bank
Indonesia (SBI) promissory note to the 10 percent level.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate of the one-month SBI note is currently at 11.
04 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah started the week at around 7,400 to the U.S. dollar
and closed at 7,660, down from 7,520 the previous day and around 7,
200 last week.
</P>
<P>
Another factor affecting the rupiah was the political
uncertainty created by the dispute between President Abdurrahman
Wahid and Gen. Wiranto, who is also the coordinating minister for
Politics and Security, Gueltom said, adding that such a dispute
has discouraged foreign investors from entering the country.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid said earlier that Wiranto should resign
following a report issued by the Commission of Inquiry on Human
Rights Violation in East Timor (KPP HAM) which said Wiranto and
some other senior military officers were responsible for
atrocities in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
But Wiranto has rejected the calls for his resignation unless
the court finds him guilty.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka on Friday marked its
52nd Independence Day in a low key amid tight security at the
Parliamentary Complex in eastern suburban Colombo, the capital
city.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga was conspicuous by her absence
from an hour-long ceremony held in the Parliamentary esplanade
where Parliament Speaker K.B. Ratnayake unfurled the national flag.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga was previously scheduled to hoist the flag before
addressing the nation.
</P>
<P>
Although the president didn't attend the ceremony, she managed
to address the nation live via satellite from her residence at
Temple Trees in downtown Colombo.
</P>
<P>
In her message to the nation, Kumaratunga appealed to the
people join together to achieve the "most necessary and urgent
goal of peace" before attaining all other objectives.
</P>
<P>
"The greatest challenge facing the people of Sri Lanka... is to
put an end to the wasteful war we embroiled in and bring about
peace," she said.
</P>
<P>
All roads to the Parliamentary Complex were heavily guarded by
police and paramilitary forces.
</P>
<P>
Security has also been tightened in the capital as three bus
bomb explosions on Thursday injured more than 30 people in Colombo
and other parts of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
These explosions and the failed assassination bid on
Kumaratunga last December were blamed on Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels, who have been fighting for a separate
homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since
1983.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Scores Easy Win for Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Swiss Martina Hingis savored her
easy victory over Russian Anna Kournikova, advancing to the semi-
finals of the Pan Pacific Open here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
For a 6-0, 6-2 win, the top-ranked player dominated the play on
the baseline and gave fifth-seeded Kournikova no time of breathing
before sealing the competitions in less than 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
This was the most lop-sided victory for defending champion
Hingis over Kournikova. In the 1997 French Open, Hingis defeated
the Russian teenager 6-1, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Hingis will face the winner between fourth seed Amanda Coetzer
of South Africa and seventh seed Chanda Rubin in the semi-finals.

<HEADLINE> Ports, Banks to Be Open on Saturdays in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to keep ports, customs, banks and some export-related
offices open on Saturdays to facilitate the clearance of export-
import goods, sources at the National Board of Revenue (NBR) said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
These offices and facilities would remain open even on Fridays
if there was day-long countrywide hartal (destructive strike) in
the week, they said.
</P>
<P>
Thus all ports, customs and export departments of government
banks would remain open on Friday and Saturday due to the 36-hour
hartal that ended at 6 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken on Wednesday during a meeting between
leaders of the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters
Association and Principal Secretary to the prime minister Dr.
Samad.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Population Not Replacing Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's population is
not replacing itself because there are fewer women of child-
bearing age and they are delaying parenthood, Statistics New
Zealand said in a media release Friday.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the birth rate fell to an average 2.01 live births for
each woman, about four percent lower than the level required for
the population to replace itself without migration, it said.
</P>
<P>
It was the 17th year in the last 20 years that fertility had
been below the replacement level.
</P>
<P>
The trend toward delayed parenthood was consolidating, with
fewer women having a child in their teens or early 20s.
</P>
<P>
There were 57,473 live births last year, four percent fewer
than the peak of 60,153 recorded in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The drop was partly due to a decrease in the number of women of
prime child-bearing age (20-34).
</P>
<P>
Deaths were up 7.3 percent at 28,117 last year.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Unemployment Down to 6.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in New
Zealand fell to 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year,
the lowest since December 1996, Statistics New Zealand's household
labor force survey showed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployed was 119,000 for the fourth quarter
against 127,000 in the third quarter and 144,000 a year ago. The
drop was the fourth consecutive quarterly fall in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The highest unemployment rate in the fourth quarter was in
Northland at 8.9 percent, and the lowest in Wellington at four
percent, followed by Auckland at five percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, all the ethnic groups recorded a decrease in their
unemployment rates. But the Maori unemployment rate was 14.5
percent, compared with 4.5 percent for Pakehas.
</P>
<P>
Industry groups to record significant annual changes in the
number of people employed were the property and business services
group (up 21,400), the wholesale and retail trade group (up 18,100)
, and the accommodation, cafes and restaurants group (down 10,400).

<HEADLINE> Hungary Experiences Warm Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 3 (Xinhua) -- An unusual warm winter has
thrown Hungary into water-related troubles, like heavy saturation
of lands and threat of floodings.
</P>
<P>
The accumulated snow on the ground has begun to melt due to
the high temperatures, which have caused the water level to rise
and caused the earth to become saturated.
</P>
<P>
The highest temperature during the past few days has reached as
high as 14 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hungarian ministry for agriculture and rural
development, a total of 320,000 hectares of land has been
saturated or flooded, 98,000 hectares of which is cropland for
winter crops, and 113,000 hectares of cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that these heavily saturated land areas are 10
times as large as those occurring in the past years and are the
largest areas in any corresponding period since the 1960s. The
plains and low-lying regions in southeast Hungary have suffered
most.
</P>
<P>
Land saturation has brought great difficulties to some
civilians' daily lives. There are 14,000 buildings and 16,000
civilians directly facing the danger of eventual flooding.
</P>
<P>
The melted snow has also caused the water level of the Tisza
Rive and its branches to rise sharply. There are about 450
kilometers of land sections declared on alert against flooding.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hungary experienced the heaviest water saturation in
30 years. Experts worries that Hungary will suffer more this year
if the weather continues to turn warm.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Premiers Urge for More Health Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian provinces are urging
the federal government to increase health spending to keep the
country's much-prized Medicare system going.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a day-long meeting Thursday in Quebec City, the
provincial premiers said their concern must be addressed in the
federal budget decision to be made this month.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa is planning to give the provinces a one-time payment of
up to 2.5 billion Canadian dollars (about 1.7 billion U.S. dollars)
to support health-care, according to local media.
</P>
<P>
The premiers, however, want the federal government to
distribute to the provinces half of the surplus of 9.5 billion
Canadian dollars (about 6.6 billion U.S. dollars) projected for
fiscal year 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
They also demand a long-term strategy, complaining about "a
situation where provinces might have to put up hospital tents on a
temporary basis."
</P>
<P>
The Medicare system, which is already hit hard by budget cuts
and staff shortage, was almost paralyzed by an outbreak of flu
last month when hospitals found themselves suffering a general
shortage of emergency rooms. Many of the patients had to wait for
long hours before being admitted for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The provincial leaders, among others, called for tax cuts,
support for education and "immediate attention" to farmers'
financial problem.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Rodman Signs One-Year Deal with Mavericks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Flaky forward Dennis Rodman
is back in the NBA, officially signing a one-year contract on
Friday with the Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
Rodman, a native of Dallas known for his changing hair colors,
outrageous behavior and seven rebounding titles, signed a deal for
the rest of the season. As a veteran with more than 10 years
experience, he will receive one million U.S. dollars, pro-rated
over the remaining 38 games.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the potentially troublesome Rodman comes in the
same week the Mavericks reached an agreement with Leon Smith,
allowing the problem rookie teenager to become a free agent before
ever playing a game for the team.
</P>
<P>
It is not known when Rodman will join the Mavericks. He had
told the team he could not play until after attending parties
around the NFL's Super Bowl and Pro Bowl for which he was to
receive appearance fees.
</P>
<P>
Rodman joining the Mavericks is partially viewed as a publicity
stunt by owner-in-waiting Mark Cuban, whose 280 million dollars
purchase of the team still must be approved by the NBA Board of
Governors. Cuban has insisted Rodman's rebounding and defense can
help the Mavericks, who at 17-27 are 8 1/2 games out of the final
playoff spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
Rodman, 38, won seven straight rebounding titles from 1992-98
with Detroit, San Antonio and Chicago. He was a member of NBA
championship teams in Detroit in 1989 and 1990 and in Chicago from
1996-98.
</P>
<P>
However, Rodman has called greater attention to himself with
his antics on and off the court. Last season, he was waived by
the Los Angeles Lakers after only 23 games following repeated team
violations, including late arrivals to practice and a four-game
leave of absence during the season.
</P>
<P>
Since leaving the Lakers, Rodman was arrested in an incident
involving his former wife, Carmen Electra. He also has been
arrested for public intoxication.
</P>
<P>
During the 1995-96 season, Rodman was suspended six games by
the NBA for head-butting referee Ted Bernhardt. In January 1997,
he was suspended 11 games by the league for kicking a cameraman in
the groin. During the 1997 NBA Finals, he made obscene and
insensitive comments regarding Mormons as Chicago battled the Utah
Jazz.
</P>
<P>
Wherever he has played, Rodman has tried to bend or break team
rules. The Mavs have many young players -- including All-Star
swingman Michael Finley and emerging forward Dirk Nowitzki -- and
there is some concern whether Rodman will have a negative impact
on the rest of the team.
</P>
<P>
At his peak, there was no questioning Rodman's ability. The 6-
8 forward is one of the best rebounders and defenders in league
history. He twice has been named NBA Defensive Player of the Year
and ranks 17th all-time with 11,783 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
On the court, Rodman is an ideal fit because he rarely shoots
and does a lot of the dirty work many players do not. In 899
games over 13 seasons, he has career averages of 7.4 points and 13.
1 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Small forward Cedric Ceballos leads the Mavs with 8.1 rebounds
per game. Power forward Gary Trent averages only 4.7 rebounds and
currently is on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
The addition of Rodman would help the Mavs against Western
Conference teams. Power forwards Chris Webber of Sacramento, Karl
Malone of Utah, Kevin Garnett of Minnesota and Tim Duncan of San
Antonio all were selected for the All-Star Game.

<HEADLINE> Maurice Greene to Compete in New York Millrose Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A group of world-class U.S.
athletics stars including world champion Maurice Greene will
compete in the 93th Millrose Games Friday night in New York.
</P>
<P>
Also competing in the indoor meet are all the winners in last
year's 15 major individual events. Greene, the world record-
holder in the men's 60 meters, and women's sprinter Inger Miller,
will run in the sprint events.
</P>
<P>
The star-studded fields also includes Stacy Dragila, the
American indoor and outdoor record-holder in the women's pole
vault; Allen Johnson, the 1996 Olympic high hurdles champion and
two-time world champion; 1996 Olympic champion high jumper Charles
Austin; and Jeff Hartwig, the U.S. inddor and outdoor record
setter in the men's pole vault.
</P>
<P>
Green, who set the world record of 9.79 seconds in the 100
meters last year, said: "I believe technigue helps you win and
have a lot of good days. I guess I had a lot of good days last
year."
</P>
<P>
Greene lost only once indoors and once outdoors, and won the
100 and 200 meters plus 4x100 relay at the World Championships
last season.
</P>
<P>
Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, the 1997 200-meter world
champion, and Jon Drummond, along with Tim Harden will compete
against Green.
</P>
<P>
The meet is the second leg of the Golden Spike Tour, which
began last year with four indoor meets and has been increased to
five this season.

<HEADLINE> Clippers Fire Coach Chris Ford, Elevate Assistant Jim Todd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles Clippers coach
Chris Ford was fired today and assistant coach Jim Todd will take
over his position.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's 114-68 loss at Phoenix, the Clippers repeatedly
settled for jump shots and offered no resistance on defense as
they were outscored 72-18 in the paint. It was Los Agneles' 12th
loss in 13 games and came one night after a 31-point home defeat
to the lowly Golden State Warriors. The Clippers has the worst
record in the Western Conference at 11-34.
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's game, Baylor approached Ford and slammed the
door of the coach's office. After Baylor walked out, Ford would
not discuss his status with the national media.
</P>
<P>
Ford directed the Clippers to just a 20-76 record over 1 1/2
seasons. Baylor chose him over Jim Brewer and Eddie Jordan, based
on his previous experience.
</P>
<P>
Ford was fired by the Milwaukee Bucks after guiding them to a
36-46 mark in the 1997-98 season. He was 69-95 in two seasons with
the Bucks and prior to that coached the Boston Celtics for five
seasons, compiling a 222-188 record and reaching the playoffs four
times. His overall mark is 311-359.
</P>
<P>
Todd stepped in in December when Ford was sidelined with back
spasms and guided the Clippers to two straight victories. He is an
interim coach and a new assistant will be added to the staff.
</P>
<P>
The Clippers have had 14 seasons of 50 or more losses and have
made the playoffs only twice since moving to the West Coast from
New York in 1978.

Prasad Bhattarai in a surprise move Thursday, The Kathmandu Post
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The English daily quoted analysts as saying that Upadhyay
tendered his resignation to protest the appointment of Ram Chandra
Poudel as deputy prime minister on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But Upadhyay said in his resignation letter that he tendered
his resignation to "uphold the important move taken for the
betterment of party, democracy and the country."

<P>
"The recent appointment of deputy prime minister is an
important move in the leadership transition to the second
generation of leaders," said the resignation letter.
</P>
<P>
Upadhyay's resignation followed the resignation of ex-finance
minister Mahesh Acharya, who submitted his resignation on January

<HEADLINE> Pressure Mounts for Indonesia's Senior Minister to  Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Pressure is mounting in Jakarta,
capital of Indonesia, for incumbent Coordinating Minister for
Politics and Security Affairs Gen. Wiranto to resign from his
cabinet post, local newspapers reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Legislators said Wiranto must quit for the good of Indonesia
and the development of democracy.
</P>
<P>
"If General Wiranto is willing to resign it would be a very big
contribution toward upholding a just and civilized process of law
in Indonesia," Heri Ahmadi, a legislator of the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI P), was quoted by the Indonesian
Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It would actually indicate a dignified stance is being taken
by TNI (Indonesian Military) which would be respected by the
people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto has been under fire following the announcement of the
Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights Violation in East Timor (KPP
HAM) that he was involved in human rights abuses in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto has been held responsible for what the commission
called a crime against humanity in the breakaway province of East
Timor, leaving thousands of civilians dead.
</P>
<P>
He has become the highest-ranking TNI official to probably face
a human rights tribunal in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, legislator Muhaimin Iskandar said Wiranto must
follow President Abdurrahman Wahid's order (to resign) and give up
his ministerial job "in the spirit of patriotism."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Wahid had asked Minister of Defense Juwono
Sudarsono to tell Wiranto to resign.
</P>
<P>
Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a political analyst who was also a top aide
to former president Habibie, said there was no chance of a
military coup in the country.
</P>
<P>
And as precautionary measures against any possible coup,
President Wahid, who is currently on a European tour, Thursday
issued a strong warning to certain TNI generals who held a meeting
in Jakarta on Wednesday, and ordered the attorney general, the TNI
chief, and the National Police chief to take control of the
situation at home.
</P>
<P>
"From here I have ordered police chief (Lt. Gen. Rusdihardjo),
TNI Commander Adm. Widodo AS, and Attorney General (Marzuki
Darusman)to take control of the situation," Wahid was quoted by
the Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We know most of those who attended the meeting. We know what
their goals are and that they have to be careful," Wahid added,
referring to Wednesday's meeting which was attended by scores of
TNI generals.

<HEADLINE> hke020414--Malaysia's External Trade Registers Remarkable Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a
remarkable surplus in external trade in 1999, showing a 23.8
percent increase over that in 1998, official figures showed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus for 1999 amounted to 72.3 billion ringgit (19.026
billion U.S. dollars) against a surplus of 58.4 billion (15.368
billion U.S. dollars) registered in 1998, statistics released by
the Statistics Department showed.
</P>
<P>
The bigger surplus in 1999 was due to a faster growth of 12.1
percent in exports against a 9.1 percent rise in imports, the
department said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Total exports and imports for 1999 stood at 321.2 billion
ringgit (84.526 billion U.S. dollars) and 248.9 billion ringgit (
65.5 billion U.S. dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
It said the strong export expansion was underpinned by the
growth in the exports of electrical and electronic products, the
country's largest exports earner, representing 57.7 percent of the
total exports.
</P>
<P>
By December 1999, Malaysia's external trade balance had been in
surplus for 26 consecutive months since November 1997.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Leader Ends Visit to Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Xanana Gusmao, East Timor's
independent leader, left here Friday for the Philippines to
continue his six-nation tour.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day official visit to Thailand, Xanana held
talks with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and other high-
ranking government officials.
</P>
<P>
He also addressed the Reporters' Association of Thailand and
the Foreign Correspondents Club in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
During these talks and in his addresses, Xanana thanked
Thailand for its support and assistance to East Timor, especially
its military presence in the territory as part of the
multinational peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Chuan, in turn, agreed in principle to East Timor's request of
allowing a Thai military medical team to stay longer in the
territory, given a U.N. approval.
</P>
<P>
The Thai prime minister also said that his country was willing
to extend further assistance to East Timor in the reconstruction
of the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
Xanana and his six-member delegation including Jose Ramos-Horta,
a Nobel Peace Prize winner and the de facto foreign minister,
arrived here Tuesday as part of his six-nation Asian tour, which
has brought him to China, South Korea and Singapore and will also
take him to the Philippines and Malaysia after Thailand.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Researchers Uncover Mitochondrial Defect Involved With Inherited Cancers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at the
University of Pittsburgh, the United States, have uncovered a
major new concept of how a certain type of tumor develops by
linking a specific defect in mitochondria to a type of inherited
tumor, the university reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They found that a defective gene on chromosome 11q23, a region
previously implicated in the progression of many solid cancerous
tumors, causes a hereditary tumor called hereditary paraganglioma.
Paraganglioma tumors most commonly occur in the carotid body, a
small organ located in the carotid artery in the neck that senses
blood oxygen levels.
</P>
<P>
"This discovery is important because for the first time it ties
a genetic defect in mitochondria to tumor development," the
university said. Mitochondrion is an organelle inside the cell
that produces enzymes essential for energy metabolism.
</P>
<P>
Results of the study appear in the February 3 issue of the
journal Science.
</P>
<P>
The researchers became interested in families with
paraganglioma who show a peculiar inheritance pattern, which can
be explained by a process called "genomic imprinting." While the
genetic defect is transmitted through both mothers and fathers,
tumors develop only when fathers transmit the defect.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that a gene was defective in families
with paraganglioma. By the researchers' reasoning, the defect is
likely to cause mitochondria to fail to properly sense the oxygen
levels in the cell. And, because of the oxygen-sensing defect, the
carotid body is chronically stimulated to compensate for the lack
of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
This chronic stimulation eventually leads to cellular
proliferation and tumor development. Chronic atmospheric hypoxia (
reduced oxygen level) was previously linked to the development of
paraganglioma tumors in people living at high altitudes.
</P>
<P>
It is conceivable, argue the researchers, that defective oxygen
sensing is a fundamental process for the progression of many
common solid cancers.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly known that low oxygen normally causes cells,
including cancer cells, to self-destruct. The new findings by the
researchers, however, show that the mechanism for cell death is
turned off. The stressful environment of hypoxia creates a
stronger tumor.
</P>
<P>
According to the researchers, some types of chemotherapy and
radiation treatments rely on oxygen as a reagent to destroy cancer
cells. In a tumor with low oxygen levels, those therapies cannot
be as effective.
</P>
<P>
University of Pittsburgh said that if the team's hypothesis is
correct, this discovery may lead to more effective cancer
treatments, and have important implications for other common
disease where hypoxia is involved, like stroke and heart attack.

<HEADLINE> Portugal to Enforce Political Sanction Against Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Portugal will formally enforce
the European Union-proposed political sanction against Austria as
from Friday because the latter has allowed the ultra-right Freedom
Party to join the coalition government, Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres announced on Thursday after consulting with President
Jorge Sampaio.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian presidential office announced late Thursday that
President Thomas Klestil will on Friday swear in a coalition
government formed by the conservative People's Party and the
Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Party stands for the expulsion of all foreigners
from Austria and its leader Joerg Haider is an ultra rightist.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the sanction announced on Monday by Portugal
on behalf of the EU, Portugal will suspend all bilateral meetings
with the Austrian government and will not support any Austria-
proposed candidate seeking positions in international
organizations, and the Austrian ambassador to Portugal will be
received only for technical reasons, said Guterres.
</P>
<P>
Guterres, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said
that the sanction will go into force automatically in other EU
member states without further consultations because all of them
have already reached consensus on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Attention Urged on Fireworks Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Six Chinese central government
departments have called for nationwide attention to fireworks
safety, especially firecrackers, during the country's Spring
Festival (Chinese Lunar New Year) that falls on February 5.
</P>
<P>
In a joint circular, the departments ordered all local branches
like the industry and commerce administration departments, and
security departments to thoroughly inspect local fireworks
manufacturers on safety issues.
</P>
<P>
"Fireworks factories that have no production certifications or
fail inspection must be shut down at once," the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The circular also urged the local authorities to enhance their
supervision at places where fireworks are sold, to prevent the
possible sale of fake or low quality fireworks.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, people are not allowed to carry
fireworks into shops, railway stations or any place where there is
a large gathering of people.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that the accidents related to the use
of fireworks have increased since last year.
</P>
<P>
From January to October, 378 people were killed and 278 injured
in fireworks-related accidents.
</P>
<P>
Firing fireworks on the eve of the Lunar New Year, a Chinese
tradition, is believed to be able to blow away fabled ghosts and
bring good luck.
</P>
<P>
But major cities across China have banned the practice in recent
years citing security and air pollution reasons.

<HEADLINE> hke020406--Indonesian President Won't Sack Wiranto, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid will not sack General Wiranto from his post as
Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security Affairs, an
official said.
</P>
<P>
The president would like Wiranto to voluntarily resign, said
Secretary for Government Affairs Bondan Gunawan here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto will not be sacked unless he was proven guilty in court
of responsibility for last September's carnage in East Timor,
Gunawan said.
</P>
<P>
"No, President Wahid will not sack Wiranto because he is still
consistent with his previous statement," the Indonesian Observer
daily Friday quoted Gunawan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gunawan was commenting on the president's statement that he has
ordered Defense and Security Minister Juwono Sudarsono to tell
Wiranto to resign.
</P>
<P>
The order came after Wiranto's name was included in a list of
33 military personnel and civilians held responsible for the East
Timor violence, in a report by the Commission of Inquiry into
Human Rights Abuses (KPP HAM).
</P>
<P>
Wiranto is among five generals accused of culpability for the
human rights abuses that took place in East Timor after the
territory voted overwhelmingly to split from Indonesia on August
30 last year.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid has said he will appoint an interim
Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security Affairs to replace
Wiranto. But Gunawan said an interim minister will only be
appointed if Wiranto is declared a suspect by the Attorney General.
</P>
<P>
"President Wahid is consistent. He said that if the Attorney
General names any minister as a suspect, then the minister must
temporarily resign from office. If the court proves him guilty, he
will be sacked from his post, but if not, his name will be
restored."

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong Friday cautioned his fellow countrymen against
complacency over the recent improved internal and external
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
For Singapore, Goh said in his Chinese New Year Message, the
main difference between this year and last is the improved
external environment featured by robust growth in major developed
economies which has boosted Singapore's exports.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's electronics sector is expected to continue its
growth, and investors are regaining confidence in Asia as the
political situation in the region improves, Goh said.
</P>
<P>
"But we must not be carried away by the glad tidings," Goh
warned, saying that economic competition is not a 100-meter sprint
but more like climbing Mount Everest (Mount Qomolangma).
</P>
<P>
"Globalization and the IT revolution will reshape the global
economy, the way business is conducted, and the nature of economic
competition," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Singaporeans to accept the fast pace and
anticipate changes in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore must bring about a change in its attitude
towards risk-taking and be more entrepreneurial and less averse to
risk.
</P>
<P>
Singaporeans must accept the fact that successful risk-takers
will earn handsome rewards because they also create opportunities
and wealth for many others in the society, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said Singaporeans have to manage the
stresses and strains to their social fabric posed by globalization,
rapid technological advances and intense competitive pressure.
</P>
<P>
"Our challenge is to strengthen the foundations of our society,
preserve our core values, and reinforce our Singapore identity, so
that we can take advantage of these changes and not be overwhelmed
by them," Goh said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada may veto the 2000 national budget if it is found that
Congress has inserted a lot of special provisions, the Philippine
Post said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that a number of special provisions,
including "pork barrel" funds, were supposedly inserted by both
the Senate and the House of Representatives prior to the bicameral
conference committee's passage of the budget Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"If there are many special provisions inserted in the budget...
then definitely we will have to take a closer look at our remedy
and one of which is, of course, a presidential veto," Executive
Secretary Ronaldo Zamora was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He particularly disputed the reported insertions made by the
House requiring prior concurrence of lawmakers before the release
of development funds intended for infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The prior concurrence means an individual member of Congress
has the power to approve or block specific infrastructure projects
of the government.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the government has yet to receive officially the
final copy of the bicameral conference committee's report and
would closely check all the provisions.
</P>
<P>
After much delays, Philippine Congress finally passed the 629-
billion-peso (15.7-billion-U.S. dollar) national budget Wednesday,
but some contentious issues remained, like the appropriation and
the requirement for prior concurrence.

MEXICO CITY, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will support an
extension of the international oil agreement at least until June
in order to boost oil price and stabilize the market, director of
the Mexican state oil company said in Villahermosa on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican proposal will be presented to Venezuela and Saudi
Arabia at a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) in March, Director of the Petroleos Mexicanos (
Pemex) Rogelio Montemayor said.
</P>
<P>
OPEC and other independent producers like Mexico reached an
agreement last April to cut oil production for one year to
strengthen crude prices which touched bottom in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Montemayor said the agreement will be extended for at least
three more months to support an orderly price adjustment and avoid
a price collapse.
</P>
<P>
"No price will be high enough for us as producers, but what is
more important is that prices have a stable behavior," said
Montemayor.

<HEADLINE> AmericaOne Takes Lead in America's Cup Yach Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- AmericaOne defeated Italy's
Prada Friday to take a 4-3 lead in the finals of the challenger
series for America's Cup yachting race.
</P>
<P>
AmericaOne's victory by one minute, six seconds could largely
owe to a mistake made by Prada skipper Francesco de Angelis at the
start as he chose the left-hand side of the race course hoping to
catch the best wind.
</P>
<P>
But the wind was with AmericaOne on the right side of the
course, and skipper Paul Cayard opened a huge lead which Prada
never challenged.
</P>
<P>
Even with gains on the three downwind legs of the six-leg, 30-
kilometer race, the Italians were never even close after the start.
AmericaOne at one stage doubled its lead in a single leg to two
minutes, 31 seconds, which was the widest margin between the boats
at any stage during the finals.
</P>
<P>
AmericaOne has taken the lead in the first-to-five finals
series for the first time, and goes into Saturday's eighth race
needing one more win to become the challenger for the America's
Cup. Prada must win both of the two remaining races before become
the challenger.
</P>
<P>
The winner of the series takes on New Zealand's team for
sailing's oldest and most prized trophy in a best-of-9 regatta
scheduled to start Feb. 19.

<HEADLINE> China to Slash Textile Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to cut the
production capacity of its textile industry by dismantling 300,000
outdated spindles in the wool spinning industry and one million in
the silk spinning industry this year.
</P>
<P>
China Daily reported today that despite improved profitability,
the wool spinning and silk industries are still plagued by
redundant capacity.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the production capacity at the 855 registered silk
factories in China is idle. About 85 percent of the wool combers
are outdated comparing with international standards. Their
products are not competitive due to low quality and inferior
design.
</P>
<P>
According to China Daily, China now is a net importer of woolen
cloth, though the made-in-China cloth was sold at only half the
prices of imported products.
</P>
<P>
Du Yuzhou, director of the State Textile Bureau, said that
technical innovation is the way out for the textile industry.
</P>
<P>
It will be profitable for firms to develop high grade woolen
cloth and lining silk to take the place of imported products,
China Daily quoted Du as saying.

BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- All major Beijing-based
newspapers splashed reports of Chinese busy preparing for the
lunar new year, the Spring Festival which falls on February 5.
</P>
<P>
The annual tide of the Chinese heading home for family reunions
is a matchless human feat.
</P>
<P>
The strong sentimental attachment to home is like an eternal
thread handed down from one generation to another.
</P>
<P>
People's willingness to pay extra money for a ticket home and
to brave the sometimes close-to-unbearable crowds has made train
and air tickets the most popular buy at this time of the year and
ticket speculation a lucrative seasonal job.
</P>
<P>
More and more ordinary Chinese are opting to holiday overseas
during the festival and more and more countries want to become
official destinations of Chinese tourist groups.
</P>
<P>
Mushrooming travel agencies specializing in holiday tours
thrive on the bulging pockets of the average Chinese. Even the
government is waiting anxiously for the anticipated buying spree
during the first week-long public holiday for the Spring Festival.

<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- About 8,200 impoverished
elderly people nationwide will enjoy this coming Spring Festival
marking the Chinese Lunar New Year that begins on Saturday, thanks
to the China National Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
Ye Yulan in Yangquan of north China's Shanxi Province, 98,
whose son is dead, last Friday personally received a red paper
envelope containing 500 yuan (60 U.S. dollars) from an official
with the committee as new year present.
</P>
<P>
The present is deemed generous by local standards as the sum is
equal to the average monthly income of local workers.
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, my life is full of happiness with the help of my
granddaughter-in-law and the society," said the elderly lady.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenfan, chairman of the committee, was quoted by Beijing-
based newspaper "China Daily" as saying, "Every member of the
society should respect and care the elderly."
</P>
<P>
The paper said Zhang is currently on a five-day greeting tour
in Yangquan and Yan'an, a sacred place of the Chinese revolution.
</P>
<P>
Ge Shusheng, 67, and his wife, Ye Xiuzheng, 64, are an
impoverished couple in ill health living in the mountainous
Zhongtai Village of Yan'an, also benefited from Zhang's tour.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the tour is the prelude to a nationwide campaign to
assist the impoverished elderly, which is in its second phase.
</P>
<P>
The first phase was started prior to the celebration of the
50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China last year, with
3,622 elderly and poor people receiving more than 1.8 million yuan
(217,000 U.S. dollars) in aid, the paper said.

VIENNA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Austrian President Thomas
Klestil will on Friday swear in a controversial coalition
government formed by the conservative People's Party and the far-
right Freedom Party, the presidential office announced late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent bid to abate the anger of Austria's EU partners
over its invitation of the far-right party into the coalition
government, Klestil asked People's Party Chairman Wolfgang
Schuessel and Freedom Party Chairman Joerg Haider to sign a
declaration acknowledging Austria's co-responsiblity in Nazi-era
crimes.
</P>
<P>
The document also said the new coalition government will
respect democracy, human rights and other international norms.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel, who was also former vice chancellor, will become
chancellor, while Vice-Chairwoman of the Freedom Party Susanne
Riess-Passer will be vice chancellor. In addition, the Freedom
Party will control the finance, justice, social affairs, defense
and infrastructure portfolios.
</P>
<P>
In an interview of the weekly magazine News published Thursday,
Klestil said he did not personally want to allow the far-right in,
but said that a parliamentary majority must be respected.
</P>
<P>
"If I have to invest this government, I would not do it out of
personal conviction because I fear Austria would be damaged
internationally," he said.

LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Soccer's world governing body
FIFA Thursday expressed "great concern" over the recent detention
of the Cote d'Ivoire football team in a military training camp
following their early exit from the African Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
"FIFA has noted with great concern that the players of the Cote
d'Ivoire national team ... (were) being detained in a military
training camp after returning to their country from the African
Cup of Nations," the organization said in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
FIFA President Sepp Blatter sent a letter to the president of
the Ivorian Football Association asking him to intervene.
</P>
<P>
"At a time when the entire football world is looking to Africa
and following its major football competition, such an action harms
the standing of football in Cote d'Ivoire and on the entire
African continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, who strongly supports Africa's bid to stage the 2006
World Cup finals, went on: "Detaining a team because it failed to
qualify for the next round of a football competition is a blatant
violation of the autonomy of the football association as well as
of the fair play principle."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday the Ivorian national squad was finally
released from the military camp at which they were detained
Tuesday, according to officials of the sports ministry.

<HEADLINE> Family Reunion Matters for Most Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Most Chinese people regard the
Spring Festival, the lunar new year, as an opportunity for family
reunions rather than the biggest festive event for the year.
</P>
<P>
Results of a recent survey conducted by the Social Survey
Institute of China show that nearly 73 percent will spend the
lunar new year on Saturday with their families.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that less than six percent
regarded the traditional Spring Festival, as very important.
Meanwhile, 19 percent were indifferent and 6.9 percent considered
the festival a burden.
</P>
<P>
However, nearly 60 percent said that the festival will remain
an important part of the national cultural fabric, while more than
70 percent said that they will follow the festival tradition of
extending new year's best wishes to relatives and friends.

<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- For Mrs Liu, a resident in
Beijing, this coming Spring Festival has brought an unexpected
rendezvous: three-day reunion with her inmate husband at home.
</P>
<P>
"I should spend the holiday chatting with my mother and my wife,
" said the husband, Mr Liu, who has lived in the Beijing Second

</P>

A total of 250 inmates will be released for family reunion from
11 prisons in Beijing as a reward for their good behavior in
prison, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xiuchang, an information officer for Beijing Prison
Administrative Bureau, said that by law any prisoner who always
behaves may spend public holidays with their family members.
</P>
<P>
Those who stay in prison will find their quarters festooned
with red lanterns and other decorations.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Bear Testimony Against Former Pakistan PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The prosecution witness and
the pilot of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight PK-805,
Captain Sarwat Hussain, Thursday provided testimony against ousted
prime minister Nawaz Sharif in a hijacking case.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Hussain said that had the plane not been
allowed to land at the Karachi Airport on October 12, 1999, it
would have crashed with 198 souls and that would have been the end
of the story, according to the state-run Associated Press of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Recording his statement at the Anti-Terrorist Court in the
southern Pakistani city of Karachi, Hussain said: "I had 198 souls
on board with limited fuel and if I was not allowed to land at
Karachi or Nawabshah and refuel the aircraft, it would soon crash.
"
</P>
<P>
When he reached Karachi, the witness said in his deposition, he
was told by the Air Traffic Control (ATC) that "you are not
permitted to land at any airfield of Pakistan and to proceed
anywhere that too at your own risk."
</P>
<P>
Hussain said he was informed in categorical terms that the
Karachi Airport was indefinitely closed.
</P>
<P>
"I informed the ATC about the presence of the Chief of Army
Staff (General Pervez Musharraf) on board PK-805, but I was also
informed by the ATC that designated alternate airport Nawabshah
was also closed."
</P>
<P>
The plane finally grounded at the Karachi airport after the
army took control of the airport. Soon after that, General
Musharraf dashed to the capital Islamabad and dismissed the Sharif
government.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, the deposed prime minister and his
allies were charged with attempted murder, hijacking and criminal
conspiracy.

The Australian:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Safer Financial Management Urged in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior financial manager
here has vowed to improve financial safety measures to meet the
challenges this financial boomtown may face when China joins the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Ma Jing, director of the Shenzhen Branch of the People's Bank
of China, the central bank, said the financial sector in Shenzhen
will be obliged to enhance its ability to ward off risks in the
increasingly intensified competition with multinational players.
</P>
<P>
The port city in Guangdong Province, south China, was one of
the country's earliest reform trailblazers, and this makes its
financial market more vulnerable to international market
vibrations, said Ma.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that banks in Shenzhen should collaborate more
closely with smaller financial institutions to improve their
competitiveness. This may lead to establishment of financial (
banking) groups.
</P>
<P>
New financial services will be created along with new financial
instruments such as agent insurance and financial derivatives, he
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a stable financial market requires sound
security, insurance, and gold markets, as well as a standardized
clearing system to ensure smooth capital flow, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma disclosed that by the end of last year, banks in Shenzhen
had recorded 255.9 billion yuan of savings deposits and granted
184.8 billion yuan of loans. The figures placed the special
economic zone the fourth and fifth, respectively, among other
Chinese cities.

<HEADLINE> European Clubs Demand Compensation for Absentees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The top European soccer clubs
want cash compensation whenever their players are unavailable
because of their international duties, Bayern Munich said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bayern said in a statement that it was one of the several
demands made to the sport's European and world governing bodies
UEFA and FIFA by the clubs from the G-14 group. The clubs tried
two years ago to set up a breakaway Super League.
</P>
<P>
Bayern, Manchester United, Real Madrid and AC Milan, among the
clubs, said 50 percent of the revenue made by the national
federations from internationals should go to the clubs.
</P>
<P>
"The clubs are not ready to look further than their own
interests," said German Football Federation (DFB) spokesman
Wolfgang Niersbach.
</P>
<P>
The clubs also demanded that national teams could take players
away from their clubs for internationals only in two periods of a
year -- in the second half of October and from mid-May to June.
</P>
<P>
The European body UEFA was told that the clubs wanted no
European club competition matches to be played during this year's
Sydney Olympics, from September 15 from October 2.
</P>
<P>
Players should also be allowed to play in a European club
competition for two different clubs during the same season, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
The demands were raised weeks after Media Partners, the company
behind the failed bid to set up a European Super League, said they
would launch another attempt to start a privately-run, elite
competition.
</P>
<P>
FIFA president Sepp Blatter last week replied with a stiff
warning to clubs tempted to join a breakaway tournament. "We must
protect the national associations and the clubs against any
attempts to create various leagues outside of the existing
Confederations, outside of the FIFA family," he said.
</P>
<P>
UEFA foiled the Super League plan by expanding the Champions
League, offering clubs a greater slice of television and
sponsorship revenue and increasing prize money.

<HEADLINE> Britain Says Watching New Austrian Government Closely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) - Britain said on Friday that it
would be watching the performance of the new Austrian government
closely.
</P>
<P>
"We have made clear our deep concern and distaste at the
inclusion in the Austrian government of a far-right party which
appeals to xenophobia," Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Cook said he welcomed the fact that the new Austrian government
had committed itself to abiding by the obligations and values of
European Union membership and to combating all forms of
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
"We will be watching closely and judging them on whether they
fulfill the commitments they have made," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Britain sharply condemned Austria's far-right
politician Joerg Haider's "naked appeal to xenophobia" and said
his policies had no place in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Britain was supporting steps by its European Union
allies and would not support Austrian candidates for international
positions.

U.S. Ambassador Kathryn Hall will ask for a meeting with
Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel to convey U.S. concerns
about the composition of the coalition, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright announced at a joint news conference with Abel
Matutes, the foreign minister of Spain.
</P>
<P>
Hall will then return to Washington for temporary consultations
and then go back to Austria to keep tabs on political developments
there.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. defense attache in Vienna was ordered not to
participate in ceremonies for Austria's new defense minister,
Albright announced.
</P>
<P>
There should be no place in a European government for a
political party that "doesn't distance itself clearly from the
atrocities of the Nazi era and the politics of hate," Albright
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The United States will "react forcefully to any deviations"
from democratic European principles, she added.
</P>
<P>
The United States will limit contacts with the new government
and review whether further actions are needed, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Albright will ask Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat, U.
S. special representative for Holocaust issues, to "be in touch
with appropriate officials to discuss how the new Austrian
government plans to handle unresolved issues from World War Two."
</P>
<P>
Joerg Haider of the far-right Freedom Party has questioned
whether there was a Holocaust in World War II in which millions of
Jews were murdered by Nazis.
</P>
<P>
Stronger steps have been taken by the 15-member European Union
(EU) which includes Austria. The 14 EU members will cut back their
diplomatic relations with Austria, which was an allied country
with Nazi during World War II.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Improvement on Cross-Border Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission urged
on Friday to improve cross-border payments to ensure inexpensive,
efficient and secure small value credit transfers between European
Union member states.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, also called on banks to remove differences between charges
for using payment cards domestically and in other EU member states
and to improve information on general conditions, fees and charges
for payment card customers.
</P>
<P>
It warned that banks and credit institutions must do more to
ensure inexpensiveness, efficiency and security.
</P>
<P>
"Unless banks do more to cut the costs of small value credit
transfers between member states, citizens and small businesses
will be denied the full benefits of the European Union internal
market and the single currency," said Frits Bolkestein, European
Union commissioner in charge of internal market.
</P>
<P>
Although large value payments as in wholesale payments can now
be made cross-border nearly as quickly and cheaply as they can
domestically, small value cross-border payments as in retail
payments take longer and cost significantly more than domestic
payments among European Union member nations.
</P>
<P>
These charges have declined in the past five years, but are
still high, according to the European Commission. Typical charges
for a credit transfer of 100 euro (97 U.S. dollars) vary between 5
and 20 euro and are sometimes even higher, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
A domestic credit transfer of the same value, in comparison,
usually costs less than 1 euro (0.97 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The commission asked last August member states to complete
cross-border credit transfers within six days and to provide clear
information to customers on tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the development of cross-border payment
infrastructure has lagged behind domestic development of
electronic transfer systems is the major source of problems
affecting small value cross-border transfers, according to the
commission.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Cut Military Presence in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian general said
Friday that some federal troops will be withdrawn from Chechnya
following the major destruction of rebels in the breakaway
republic in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
"Following the defeat of large rebel formations, including
those in Grozny, the size of the federal force will be reduced,"
said Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the General Staff of
the Russian Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 rebels were killed over the recent several days,
a major breakthrough in the federal campaign against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He categorically denied the possibility of a guerrilla war in
the republic. "All talk about a guerrilla war is a deliberate or
erroneous mystification," the Interfax news agency quoted him as
saying at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"A guerrilla war is a war waged by the people and broadly
supported by the people. What we are witnessing is a complete
rejection of bandit and terrorist formations by the people. Three
years (1996 to 1999) have shown their real worth," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Russian grouping is ready to resist the rebels
' "subversive and terrorist actions."
</P>
<P>
Manilov added that the recent drafting of reserve officers has
nothing to do with the situation in Chechnya. "It is standard
procedure," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The same applies to military re-training courses, which must
be conducted every year. We have not been able to afford them in
the past few years. If money is available now, re-training courses
will be organized; if not, no military re-training courses will be
conducted," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
As to the casualties, Manilov said 1,290 federal servicemen
have been killed and 3,970 wounded since the military campaign was
launched against Chechen rebels last summer, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
These figures represent losses in action against Chechnya-based
rebels in Russia's Daghestan region and the subsequent war inside
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Manilov said that 7,000 to 8,000 rebels were currently fighting
Russian forces in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"There remain about 1,000 (Chechen) fighters in Grozny who are
no longer under centralized control and no longer have a single
source of logistic support," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
Another 6,000 to 7,000 rebels are in the area of the Argun and
Vedeno gorges in the southern mountainous regions of Chechnya, he
added.

NAIROBI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Ghana and Liberia Friday signed
an agreement to allow passengers on Ghana Airways flights from New
York to disembark at the Robertsfield Airport in Monrovia before
proceeding to Accra, Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Minister of Roads and Transport Edward Salia and his
Liberian counterpart Brahimaa Kaba signed a memorandum of
understanding to this effect in Accra.
</P>
<P>
The measure would save Liberian travellers the inconvenience
they previously experienced by disembarking in Accra before
continuing their journey, Salia said.
</P>
<P>
He said Ghana Airways in the long run intends to acquire the
necessary clearance from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
to enable it to pick Liberian passengers from Monrovia to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is a practical demonstration of Ghana's
commitment to regional integration and its Gateway Program, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Salia underscored the importance of regional co-operation in
the development process and urged African countries to utilize
existing infrastructure and facilities in neighboring countries
rather than duplicating them.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Kaba praised Ghana for its support to
Liberia during the civil war and the reconstruction period and
appealed for continued assistance.
</P>
<P>
Ghana Airways deserves the opportunity to operate in Liberia
since it was the first airline to resume normal scheduled flights
to that country after the war, he said.

NAIROBI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A new national crusade, to be
implemented in two phases over a period of two years against the
HIV/AIDS scourge, is to be launched next week, Ghana News Agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The "Love Life, Stop AIDS" campaign would focus on prevention
of HIV transmission and compassion for those who are HIV positive,
Ghanaian Minister of Communications John Mahama was quoted as
saying at a press briefing here on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, to be launched by First lady Nana Konadu Agyeman
Rawlings, will synthesize lessons learnt from fighting AIDS in
Africa over the past decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahama warned that the serious spectre of AIDS poses a real
danger that could spiral out of control and the "time to act is
now".
</P>
<P>
"The gains and growth made in agriculture could be eroded
because the most productive segment of the population who should
sustain this progress will no more be around if this menace is not
checked," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Minister of Employment and Social Welfare Ama
Benyiwa- Doe said the current national prevalence rate of AIDS is
4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
She called on all stakeholders to join in the formulation,
implementation, control and monitoring of strategies and programs
aimed at reducing and consequently eradicating AIDS from the
country.

assessment, this decision is on the willing of shareholders."
</P>
<P>
"We are both winners," said Gent at the press conference in
Dusseldorf. And Esser projected a formal approval of Mannesmann
supervisory board on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement between two companies, Mannesmann
shareholders will keep 49.5 per cent of stake in the new company
through share exchange.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday evening, Gent raised his offer by about five per
cent over the base of last year. His new offer is 58.96 Vodafone
shares for each Mannesmann share. The new offer makes every
Mannesmann share valuing 340 dollars (353 euros.)
</P>
<P>
That means the deal, valuing some 198 billion dollars (400
billion marks), will be the largest in industry history, breaking
the record of American OnLine's acquisition of Time Warner in
January.
</P>
<P>
In the new company, Mannesmann will be able to keep its
divisions in France and Italy, namely Arcor and Inforstrada, and
go on with its strategy in data communications and electronic
commerce, while Mannesmann's headquarters in Duesseldorf will
become the new company's center for business in Europe.
</P>
<P>
But Mannesmann's traditional departments for engineering and
automotive will be dispatched and go on stocks market separately,
the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
The takeover war around Mannesmann had lasted for three and a
half months before the last-minute meeting between Gent and Esser.
Vodafone announced a hostile bid in last December, when Esser
rejected its offer of 54.7 Vodafone shares for each Mannesman
share.
</P>
<P>
Gent flew to Duesseldorf Wednesday evening with his new offer
for a "friendly solution" and held close-door meeting with
Mannesmann management. Though no information had been disclosed,
the market has speculated a "friendly merger" since then.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Russian Demand for Release of Vessel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
rejected Friday the demand of the Russian government to
immediately release a Russian tanker seized by a U.S. Navy vessel.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the Volga-Neft-147 on Wednesday in the Persian
Gulf was prompted by suspicions that the tanker was carrying Iraqi
oil in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government officials said the tanker likely would be
diverted to pro-Western Oman, where an analysis of the oil would
take place to determine its origin.
</P>
<P>
The tanker was in international waters off the Omani coast on
Friday, according to the Associated Press. A Pentagon spokesman,
Army Col. Vince Ogilvie, said Friday two officials from the
Russian consulate in the United Arab Emirates boarded the tanker,
as did two American defense attache officers.
</P>
<P>
Russia maintains the oil is from Iran, not Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States has long been at odds with Russia over Iraq.
Russia is a strong supporter of steps in support of the eventual
lifting of the U.N. economic embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said the administration was merely enforcing
the embargo against Iraq in ordering the seizure of the Russian
vessel.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has not said the Russian government
was involved with Volga-Neft-147 or its cargo.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Friday in an interview
en route to Munich, Germany, there was no confirmation of Russian
government involvement in the alleged trafficking of Iraqi oil by
Russian tankers.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is banned from most international commerce but is allowed
to export up to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars in oil every six months
in order to buy food, medicine and other essentials for its people,
and spare parts for its oil industry.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Hits New Record on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose to the record high Friday despite reports on
lower unemployment rate and rising inflation pressures. But the
Dow Jones industrial average fell.
</P>
<P>
At close of the session, the Nasdaq index rose 33.16 at 4,244.
14, surpassing the record closing high of 4,235.40 set on January
21.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow index finished
down 49.64 at 10,963.80  and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell
0.60 at 1,424.37.
</P>
<P>
Technology stocks rose in defiance of reports that the U.S.
unemployment rate was down to 4 percent in January, the lowest
level in 30 years. Analysts expected the jobless rate to even fall
below 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The tightening labor market could spark inflation and therefore
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again. The
Federal Reserve raised rates Wednesday for the fourth time in the
past six months to cool off the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported average hourly
earnings, a key gauge of inflation, rose a 0.4 percent to 13.50 U.
S. dollars in January, the fastest pace since September. That
indicated more pressures on inflation.
</P>
<P>
But investors pull money out of blue chip stocks, pushing the
Dow index lower.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 2.73 at 626.90 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 5.36 at 882.97. But The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 3.89 at 525.52.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,564 down, 1,418 up and 543
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 1.03 billion shares from 1.11 billion
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Online Travel Market Continues Surge in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The marriage between the
Internet and travel consumers has never been stronger in the
United States, and brick-and-mortar travel agencies are paying the
price, according to a report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 15 percent fewer travel agencies in the
country than there were at the end of 1997, said the report from
Gomez Advisors, a U.S. e-commerce research and analysis firm. The
vast majority of these agencies are the small independent firms
who relied on ever-shrinking commissions from airline bookings to
make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
"(Travel) agencies are closing across the country because they
cannot compete with the robust product being offered by leading
online travel sites," the research firm said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of specific products being purchased online, the Gomez
research shows that 60 percent of all airline tickets being
purchased online are booked through individual airline sites.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, American consumers spent 3.5 billion U.S. dollars on
airline tickets purchased online, and Gomez expects that number to
rise to 6.3 billion dollars in 2000.
</P>
<P>
More and more Americans will purchase airline tickets from
leading online travel agents instead of airline Web sites,
according to Gomez, because the latter are not offering the kind
of comprehensive services, travel packages and technology backbone
that consumers demand. The top three online travel firms now take
in more than 40 percent of all online travel bookings.

<HEADLINE> Pemex Produces 2.9 Million BPD of Oil in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Petroleos Mexicanos (
Pemex) state-owned oil company produced 2.9 million barrels of
crude oil a day in 1999 in its marine and land fields, the company
announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The company said in a communique that this production volume
permitted it to fulfill adequately the demand of national energy
and comply with its exports commitments.
</P>
<P>
Pemex said that it exported 1.5 million of the 2.9 million
barrels of oil produced in 1999 to its customers in the American
continent, in Europe, and in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the production was sent to the national refining
system to supply the demand of national fuels.
</P>
<P>
Pemex extracted a daily average of 4.7 million cubic feet of
natural gas, similar to  1998.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela agreed in The Hague in May,
1998, to reduce their export quotas to improve the international
price of crude, an accord confirmed by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that same month.
