<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 children in Maianga
district in the Angolan capital have been hospitalized due to
suffocation caused by construction pollution, the official Angola
News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in the Luanda Children's Hospital said the small
patients also have symptoms of cough, flu and conjunctivitis.
Since they all suffer tuberculosis, there must be serious damage
to their health.
</P>
<P>
Investigations conducted by the hospital showed that the
children all the neighborhood where strong and thick dust caused
by a construction company named "Paviterra" has whitened all
objects within 100 meters of the construction site.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the company confirmed that the dust comes
from a large sized stone-breaking machine. But no measures have
been taken since the company got the warning from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The hospital has informed the incident to the municipal
government, and asked for intervention from the city health
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Maianga is a highly-populated district in Luanda city. It is
claimed that about 20,000 people live near the pollution source.

<HEADLINE> European Markets End In Downbeat Mood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Europe's main stock markets ended
Friday in a mainly downbeat mood, in the wake of a poor opening on
Wall Street and a lack of corporate news.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 slipped 12 points to end at 6,563.2, a fall
of less than 0.2 percent, which left UK blue chips almost at the
same level as a week ago.
</P>
<P>
In corporate terms, telecom stocks again held center stage on
the day. The prospect of rival bids for assets of Cable &AMP; Wireless
Communications lifted its shares 1.8 percent to 725 pence.
</P>
<P>
Telewest, the UK's largest cable firm, was sent reeling as
investors reacted to the prospects of a bid battle with market
number two NTL. Telewest stock slumped over 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Paris stocks end a listless session around opening levels and
just below par, under the influence of mixed early Wall Street and
profit-taking after Thursday's gains.
</P>
<P>
CAC-40 closed down 0.19 percent at 4,656.79 points in thin
volume of 1.5 billion euros. The index is up just 0.2 percent on
the week.
</P>
<P>
Germany's blue chips were the only ones to defy the drop with
the Xetra Dax in Frankfurt closing just inside the plus column, up
less than one point at 5,619.94.

<HEADLINE> Russian Communist Party Condemns US Over Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of the
Russian Federation Friday criticized the U.S. and NATO for
"conspiring" against Cyprus, an independent and active member of
the Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
The party made the condemnation in a statement marking the 25th
anniversary of the July 1974 military coup in Cyprus engineered by
the Greek military junta and the subsequent Turkish invasion and
occupation., the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that the main obstacle to the Cyprus
issue remains the uncurbed stance of the Turkish Cypriot
leadership which relies on the backing of Ankara and its NATO
allies.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the tragic events 25 years ago led Greek and
Turkish Cypriots to many disasters and to the division of the
country with thousands of Cypriots remaining refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a just solution to the Cyprus issue can only
be reached if its territorial integrity is achieved and the
legitimate rights of all Cypriot citizens are secured," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Communist Party also expressed its solidarity to
the people of Cyprus for their struggle for reunification,
democracy and peace.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair discussed efforts to revive the
peace process in Northern Ireland in a telephone call Friday.

White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said that Clinton and Blair

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Calls for Strategic Ties With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
Friday called for strategic ties between Jordan and Turkey to
safeguard and promote the interest of the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal during his talks with visiting Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel at the royal court in the southern
port city of Aqaba, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah described the Jordanian-Turkish ties as the
cornerstone in the region's stability and economy as well as the
bridge of the Arab world to European countries.
</P>
<P>
"The developments and changes in the region call upon us to
elevate the kingdom's ties with Turkey to strategic
dimensions," said the Jordanian ruler.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also hoped Turkey will play a significant role in the
Middle East peace process and contribute to peace and prosperity
in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said both Turkey and Jordan hope to build their
bilateral ties into a model of international relations and Turkey
will spare no efforts to help achieve peace and stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Turkey would like to develop friendly relations with all
neighbors, Demirel said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
On Iraq, Demirel said Turkey will not encroach on the national
unity and territorial integrity of Iraq and hopes Baghdad will
soon restore its normal status in the world community.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention that Turkish troops occasionally entered
northern Iraq in recent years to crack down on Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Demirel arrived at Aqaba Friday afternoon for talks with
Abdullah on bilateral and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders called on parties concerned to revive the Middle
East peace process amid what they saw as a positive atmosphere
following the swear-in of Israel's new Prime Minister Ehud Barak
ealier this month.
</P>
<P>
Barak vowed to abide by all agreements Israel had signed with
the Palestinians during a brief visit to Jordan on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Albright Seek Ways to Restart Mideast Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Israeli Prime Minister Friday tackled
details of how to resume talks between Israel and Syria as well as
between Israel and the Palestinians, a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who spent night in Camp David with President Bill
Clinton with a continued discussion on the Middle East peace
process, had breakfast with Albright Friday morning at the garden
of her home in Georgetown section of Washington.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the prospects for negotiations between Israel
and Syria, between Israel and the Palestinians and about U.S.
military sales to Israel, the senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Albright told reporters after the breakfast that the United
States and Israel "have been able to reestablish a really
important working relationship that is based on trust and
confidence and the ability to work together."
</P>
<P>
She said she would take a trip to the Middle East next month.
</P>
<P>
The senior official said Albright would probably include a wide
array of countries in her traveling to the region, and "most
likely will include Damascus."
</P>
<P>
Barak hoped to reopen negotiations with Syria as soon as
possible and he said at the welcoming ceremony at the White House
Thursday that he expected to meet Syrian President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
But he was cautious in speaking of talks with Syria, saying, "I
will bring about only those arrangements that to the best of my
knowledge will strengthen the security of the state of Israel by
bringing an end to the conflict."
</P>
<P>
The issue of the Golan Heights was the biggest hurdle Israel
should overcome before it could reach any agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria's sovereign territory of the Golan Heights was captured
by Israel during the 1996 Middle East war. Syria is insisting on
Israel's full withdrawal from the heights but Barak showed no such
intention.
</P>
<P>
The senior U.S. official said the two sides should find a way
to bridge that gap. That's what Albright and Barak talked about,
he added.
</P>
<P>
With regard to talks between Israel and the Palestinians, the
U.S. official warned against any expectation for rapid progress,
saying the negotiations would grow tougher as they moved into the
hardest disputes.
</P>
<P>
"Since we're at the end of the process, especially on the
statehood, borders, refugees and Jerusalem, no amount of good
feeling is going to overcome those problems," he said. "There's no
substitute for the hard compromises."
</P>
<P>
After the talks with Albright, Barak went to the Pentagon to
meet Defense Secretary William Cohen before flying to New York for
the weekend.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chamber Chief Ends Historic Visit to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Chamber of Commerce
President Thomas J. Donohue returned Thursday night from a
historic three-day visit to Cuba with agreement from the Cuban
government to allow further ties to develop between the U.S.
Chamber and the private sector in the Caribbean country, the U.S.
Chamber announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Donohue's trip was a first for a leader of the U.S. Chamber
since the Communists seized power 40 years ago. During his visit,
he met with President Fidel Castro and his top ministers, as well
as street vendors and restaurant owners.
</P>
<P>
"After some back and forth, the Cuban authorities agreed that
we would build our relationship along two avenues. We will deal
directly with the self-employed and work with the Cuban Chamber of
Commerce and its state-managed member corporations," Donohue said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The process of change has begun," Donohue said. "The most that
can be said is that the regime is permitting certain activities
and associations it had not permitted in the past. In this small
way the process of change in Cuba has begun and we ought to seize
the opportunity to spur it on."
</P>
<P>
"We will be working with the Cubans over the next few weeks to
flesh out the details on building relationships with both
independent companies and public corporations. We are quite
satisfied with the agreement reached with the Cuban government on
this approach," Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world's largest business
federation, representing more than 3 million businesses and
organizations of every size, sector and region.

<HEADLINE> Lay-off of 2,159 Gold Mine Workers Imminent in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The union official made the warning Friday at a meeting between
Ghana's Minister of Mines and Energy and South Africa's Deputy
Minister of Minerals and Energy in Accra, the capital.
</P>
<P>
He explained that most of the mining communities do nothing
but mine, and the current adverse situation will have serious
damage on them.
</P>
<P>
The price of gold has plummeted to its lowest in 20 years
following British sale of 25 tons of gold, the first sale of an
intended 450 tons of their total 750-ton gold reserves, plus a 10
million ounces sale proposed by the IMF and the World Bank last
month.
</P>
<P>
Before this, the price of gold which was at 261 dollars an
ounce, dropped to 255 dollars, a figure far below the
278-dollar-an-ounce at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
John Stewart, a mining consultant of the South African Chamber
of Mines, said that between January 1997 and December 1998, the
price of gold dropped from 360 dollars an ounce to 290 dollars and
is still falling. He added that following the British sale which
started last week, 150,000 jobs have been lost in South African
mines.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called on governments and central banks in the
lobby group to do all they can to reverse the changing fortunes of
the gold industry in Africa.
</P>
<P>
 "We must ensure that the African renaissance works,
especially through mining which is the foundation for an
accelerated and sustained development pattern," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Ghana and South Africa to lend massive support to the
deal as the largest producers on the continent who stand to lose
most from the sales.
</P>
<P>
George M. Osei, coordinator of the Ghana Chamber of Mines, said
the situation in the industry will result in a sharp decline in
exploratory activities, to a fall in chamber members.
</P>
<P>
He said the industry will soon find it difficult to mobilize
capital if the situation does not change and noted that all
efforts must be made to stop the sale.
</P>
<P>
Archie Palane, deputy-general secretary of the South African
National Union of Mine workers, said workers face serious
frustrations from the lay- offs that will arise.
</P>
<P>
Mona Caesar Addo, Investment Treasurer of Ashanti said Friday
in an interview monitored on a local radio station that Ashanti
has embarked on a cost-cutting measure.
</P>
<P>
She mentioned cancellation of contract mining, adoption of
mechanized mining and cutting of waste in supplies as some of the
measures.
</P>
<P>
Addo said the problem was a real threat whose impact is very
damaging, citing the 38.2-percent contribution of the industry to
the national budget as impossible.
</P>
<P>
She said the company is in the process of adding value to
their production by producing jewellery for the international
market.
</P>
<P>
"Ashanti is hedged in the next 15 years, but if the price of
the commodity does not change in the next couple of years, we will
start feeling the pinch," she added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Praises Bonn's Stand on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 16 (xinhua) -- The German government's adherence to
the one-China policy is appreciable, said Lu Qiutian, the
Chinese ambassador in Bonn, Friday.
</P>
<P>
At an interview with Xinhua, Lu praised the German government's
stand of developing Sino-German ties and acknowledging Beijing as
the only legitimate Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed
that Bonn would not change its China policy and that only one
Chinese government was acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui, the leader of Taiwan authorities, told German
Deutsche Welle radio earlier this week that the Chinese mainland
and Taiwan would be a "state-to-state" relationship. Lee's
separatistic remarks have aroused cross-straits tension.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Lee's speech, Lu commented, "What the Taiwan
authorities attempt is to exploit German media to spread
separatism, mislead international opinion, and disturb Sino-German
relationship. That must be futile."
</P>
<P>
The Sino-German ties are developing in good trends, and the
cooperations between the two countries are being continuously
intensified and expanded in all fields, said Lu.
</P>
<P>
Lee's remarks will not change the fact that Taiwan is a part of
Chinese territory and the Chinese government owns sovereignty over
it, and it is a basic rule accepted by the international society,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese nation is a great nation that has created a
unified country with the longest history in the world. The
integration of national territory and sovereignty is most valued
in Chinese civilization," said the Ambassador.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people have supported the
re-unification of Germany. And I have every reason to expect our
re-unification will win the backing of the German government and
people, who lived in a separated nation for so many years," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Arab Bank Grants Loans to Three African States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Bank for Economic
Development in Africa has agreed to further grant loans to three
African countries, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Abdullah el-Aqeil, board chairman of the bank, told the
news agency that the bank signed separate agreements with
Tanzania, Mali and Mozambique Thursday night in Cairo on offering
the loans.
</P>
<P>
El-Aqeil said the loans are aimed at funding development
projects in the three countries in a bid to help promote their
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed with Tanzania, the bank is to
provide the Eastern African country with 3.32 million U.S. dollars
to finance its reconstruction move of rural areas in Zanzibar, an
island off the coast of mainland Tanzania, he said.
</P>
<P>
The loan will increase the bank's funds for Tanzania to a total
of 50.87 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mali will receive a loan of 5.5 million dollars from the bank
under a second deal for an agricultural project to cultivate 400
hectares of rice and grains. The bank has provided Mali with loans
of 86.62 million dollars before this one.
</P>
<P>
For Mozambique, the bank has decided to extend 13.8 million
dollars to a power transmission project in the city of Mbamba,
raising the bank's loans to the Southern African country to 128.91
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The three loans will all be repaid at an annual interest rate
of 3 percent and have grace periods of three to five years. The
bank chairman did not mention when the loans should be refunded.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, set up by
Arab and African countries, is aimed at joining efforts of those
countries to promote economic cooperation for their common
development.

<HEADLINE> Crisis Warning Overshadows N.Ireland Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Friday
warned of the "crisis" threatening the Northern Ireland peace
process, as political parties in the British province spent a day
in talks to put it back on track.
</P>
<P>
The process fell into disarray Thursday when the Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP), led by David Trimble, refused to sit in the
executive with Sinn Fein, saying the IRA had given no commitment
to disarm.
</P>
<P>
A BBC report quoted Adams as saying this week's failure to set
up a power-sharing executive had been a "defining moment" and he
could not emphasize enough the "seriousness" of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Adams was speaking outside Castle Buildings, Stormont, after a
meeting with Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam and Political
Development Minister Paul Murphy, who met all eight parties in
separate delegations Friday in an attempt to rescue the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The meetings came amid fears of the consequences of a political
vacuum in Northern Ireland, which could lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
The Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) warned Friday that the
Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) is to "review its attitude to the
entire peace process" over the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
But the PUP, along with many of the eight parties, also
welcomed the suggestion that former talks chairman, George
Mitchell, may be invited to return to organized discussions.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. senator, who brokered the 1998 Good Friday
Agreement, has been invited to a review meeting with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, UUP leader and Northern Ireland First Minister David
Trimble was less enthusiastic about Mitchell's return, fearing it
could be seen as a regressive step.
</P>
<P>
"We need to have a review that's focused on the issues, not a
renegotiation," he was quoted as saying. "And there is the danger
that if you bring in George, you make it appear as though you're
going back to the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his meeting with Mowlam and Murphy, Trimble
invited the province's political parties for face-to-face talks
"as soon as is practicable."
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that the planned review of the Good Friday
Agreement must not turn into an attempt to renegotiate the terms
of the accord.
</P>
<P>
Trimble also attacked Sinn Fein and the PUP for "going around
trying to increase tension, trying to suggest that it's the last
chance that after this everything collapses."
</P>
<P>
"This apocalyptic language isn't appropriate at all," he said,
adding that he was still considering his position as first
minister following the resignation of Deputy First Minister Seamus
Mallon of the Social and Democratic Labor Party Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mallon insisted he was "absolutely convinced" he was right to
resign, and suggested that Trimble should follow his example.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Democratic Unionist Party leader the Rev Ian Paisley
accused Blair of breaking pledges made in the Good Friday
Agreement, saying that the prime minister had promised that
parties with paramilitary wings who were engaged in violence would
be excluded from the executive, and that prisoner releases would
be stopped unless violence was given up for good.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Democracy Blamed for Conflicts in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Affairs Minister
Stan Mudenge said here Friday that lack of democracy in many
African countries significantly contributes to the instability and
conflicts affecting the continent.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters on the just ended 35th summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) which was held in Algiers,
Algeria, Mudenge said 45 leaders attending the meeting agreed that
they would ban military governments from future OAU summits.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders took a position that they will no longer accept
military coups," he said, adding that the OAU would no longer
tolerate the participation of illegitimate regimes, in line with
the 1997 Harare declaration."
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the leaders also adopted the OAU declaration
against terrorism. The continental body would soon call for an
international conference on anti-terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He said other discussions at the summit which centered mainly
on the conflicts affecting the continent and the question of
globalization, were " unusually" frank, serious and focused.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state listed conflicts currently troubling the
continent as the costly and bloody border war between Ethiopia
and Eritrea and the wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo and
Angola.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the leaders reaffirmed the need to provide African
 solutions to African problems.
</P>
<P>
He said Ethiopia and Eritrea were moving toward the signing of
a peace agreement after several separate meetings were held at the
OAU summit.

<HEADLINE> Another Meeting Set to Explore DRC Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The search to end hostilities in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues, with another
meeting of foreign and defense ministers of countries involved in
the conflict set to start in the Zambian capital Lusaka Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge said here Friday that
the belligerents will meet in Lusaka to set up a Joint Military
Commission, tasked with overseeing the ceasefire and investigating
any alleged violations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also expected to look into the continued
fighting by the rebels with an aim to ensure that the ceasefire
accord is upheld.
</P>
<P>
Each of the concerned parties to the DRC conflict -- Angola,
the DRC, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Rwanda -- is expected to
propose two officials to the joint commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission will work in conjunction with observers from the
United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers of defense and foreign affairs of all the
belligerents will be meeting in Lusaka on Monday. We want to set
up the joint military commission. I cannot say how long the
meeting will last, it will depend on the discussions," said
Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second meeting in the Zambian capital in three
weeks among the warring parties in a bid to try to end the
11-month war in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Asked how effective the peace accord signed in Lusaka more than
a week ago was considering that the rebels did not sign, Mudenge
told reporters that the Lusaka summit was a success and they had
been congratulated by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"The great danger is if the situation remains without anyone
monitoring it -- this has to be corrected on Monday. What we need
are peacekeepers and observers, at the moment we are relying on
different stories," he said.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports of continued fighting in the vast
central African country after the signing of the ceasefire deal,
with DRC President Laurent Kabila accusing the rebels of violating
the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Launches Anti-Corruption Awareness Walk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of secondary school
students held an anti-corruption awareness youth walk here Friday
from downtown Lusaka to the High Court about five kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
At the gathering in the court, Steven Moyo, general secretary
of  Transparency International - Zambia, said "there has been an
upsurge in public concern about levels of corruption in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
According to the corruption index issued by the Transparency
International in 1998, Zambia was ranked at 53, as the most
corrupt nation in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption distorts decision-making and choices where
contracts go to those who offer illicit gains rather than the best
products. Corruption can undermine legitimacy of the government,
lead to serious environmental degradation and chronic
under-development. There can be little doubt that corruption
constitutes the single greatest challenge to the new dispensation
in Zambia," said Moyo.
</P>
<P>
He told the youth that their participation in this walk is
meant to contribute to the agitation for zero tolerance of
corruption amongst the youths vis-a-vis leaking of examinations
papers, drug abuse, alcoholism, moral behavior and the education
of the youth on the fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
"As we enter the new millennium in less than six months,
youths are calling on all political parties to lead by example -
and be committed more than ever before to starting a new era of a
corruption-free country," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Isaac Mwanza, executive director of the
Foundation for Corruption Awareness (FAC), said corruption is a
serious disease in our society can best be curbed by the
participation of everyone in anti- corruption programs aimed at
changing the attitudes, practices and behavior among youths and
community members.
</P>
<P>
He said combating corruption is essential to maintaining the
public's confidence in the country's ability to provide basic
essential services to its citizen.
</P>
<P>
A successful assault on corruption calls for positive public
support which must be reinforced through mechanism that gives
appropriate protection to those who "blow the whistle" on corrupt
practices, Mwanza said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Question Core of Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said here on Friday that the Palestinian cause is the
core of the Middle East peace process and should be solved first
to establish permanent and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The region has currently a golden opportunity to solve the
Arab-Israeli dispute and all parties should make use of it,"
Demirel said in a joint press conference after meeting with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Turkey welcomes any peace deal that Israel will reach with the
Palestinians on one hand, and Syria and Lebanon on the other, and
Turkey is looking forward to establishing a lasting peace in the
Middle East, Demirel added.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the region is at a delicate stage, he said,
noting that his country attaches great importance to peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat denied that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has asked him to combine the U.S.-brokered Wye river peace deal
with the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that Ehud did not raise the issue during his recent
meeting with him held in the Erez crossing point, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the final status talks will be held
later this month.
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral ties, Arafat warmly welcomed Demirel's visit
to the Palestinian self-rule areas, saying that it will contribute
greatly to the development of the deeply-rooted ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Arafat thanked Turkey for its support to the Palestinian
people. Turkey and President Demirel personally, played a
significant role in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Demirel said that bilateral ties witnessed a
day-to-day progress in the areas of economy and trade, voicing
belief that cooperation between the two sides will expand
especially after the signing of an accord on tourist cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Turkey promised to offer some 54 million U.S. dollars
in financial aid to Palestine. The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) received 4 million by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Demirel arrived here Friday morning after his tour of Israel
and he has left here for Amman on a state visit to Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Ghana to Join S. Africa in Opposing Gold Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 NAIROBI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Ghana said it will cooperate
with South Africa and other gold producing countries in Africa to
mount a firm opposition to the proposed International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the current British gold sale, which has thrown
gold prices down to a 20-year low.
</P>
<P>
 This is because of the devastating effect it will have on
their gold mines, economies and workers, the Ghana News Agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
 Fred Ohene Kena, Minister of Mines and Energy, said in Accra,
capital of Ghana, during a meeting with a six-member South African
delegation led by Susam Shabangu, deputy minister of minerals and
energy, that with the globalization of the world, the fate of one
country quickly affects the other.
</P>
<P>
He said Ghana cannot sit down unconcerned about the effects of
the gold sales by mostly European nations on the economies of
gold-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
 "We condemn this move in no uncertain terms. We need to be
very vociferous in letting the international community know what
this means to our economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
 The delegation is in the country to drum up support for a
concerted effort to stop the British gold sales and intended
sales by the IMF, World Bank and five other Central Banks in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
 Kena said even though some mines have started cutting costs
to stay in line with production targets, "this is going to throw
gold production out of gear," and have destructive effects on the
environment as well.
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot let this continue, as before long, such mines
cannot cope and will have to resort to mass lay-offs, not counting
the multiplier effect it will have on highly indebted poor
countries," Kena added.
</P>
<P>
 The price of gold, which was about 261 dollars an ounce
before the British sale, is now at about 255 dollars, a figure
that is far below the 278-dollar-an ounce at the beginning of the
year.
</P>
<P>
 Shabangu said she appreciated Ghana's initial overtures
concerning the issue and hoped that a solid proposal would be
found to solve the problem of gold prices and thereby those of the
numerous households and communities whose life would be thrown
into jeopardy as a result of the sales.
</P>
<P>
 "We are excited about the minister's response, especially as
he believes in our stand and proposals. He agrees with our
strategies and proposals," she added.
</P>
<P>
 The South African official said the current state of the gold
industry is critical and of major concern to gold producing
nations as well as investors seeking to invest on the continent.
</P>
<P>
 "Already, the support of the entire South African Development
 Community has been sought following a series of meetings that
have been held and we thought it wise to contact some other major
gold mining nations in other parts of the African continent, hence
our decision to come to Ghana," she explained.
</P>
<P>
 Shabangu condemned speculators on the gold market and
questioned their role in the industry, which she described as
"negative".
</P>
<P>
 If the inevitable happens and Africa's plea is snubbed, it
may be necessary for African leaders of gold mining countries to
meet again to fashion out other alternatives to stop it, the
deputy minister suggested.
</P>
<P>
Shabangu noted that it was pathetic that the highly indebted
poor countries, which are expected to benefit from the IMF and
World Bank gold sales, were never part of the proposals or talks
toward them.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Albright Hold Talks on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Friday that she will go to the Middle East next
month to work with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak for the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to going to the region some time in
August and I most of all look forward to working with the prime
minister who is dedicated to the Middle East peace process," she
told reporters in the garden of her home after a breakfast with
Barak.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the United States will have an active role in
pushing the peace forward and said she will do "what will be
needed and what I am asked to do."
</P>
<P>
Barak said Albright's trip to the region will "help shape the
overall strategy and the details" in the road toward a final
settlement.
</P>
<P>
"I reaffirmed to the secretary our commitment to abide by
international agreements signed by our government, including Wye,
our determination to move forward on all tracks, and our looking
forward to see the secretary coming to the Middle East during the
month of August to help shaping the overall strategy and the
details of how to move forward in our determined road toward peace
in the Middle East," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Barak held two and a half hours of meeting with President Bill
Clinton Thursday and then they flew to Cam David where a landmark
Mideast peace agreement between Egypt and Israel was forged two
decades ago.

<HEADLINE> Launch of New U.S. Weather Satellite Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The launch of a sophisticated
new weather satellite GOES-L has been postponed until October, the
U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
GOES-L was originally scheduled for a launch in May. It was
postponed during a review of recent launch failures in the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and now has
been rescheduled for the fall, the NOAA said.
</P>
<P>
The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite will
monitor hurricanes, severe thunderstorms and other severe weather.
</P>
<P>
The United States operates two weather satellites in
geostationary orbit 35,680 kilometers over the Equator. GOES-8,
launched in 1994, is overlooking the East Coast out into the
Atlantic Ocean and GOES-10, launched in 1997, is currently
overlooking the West Coast out into the Pacific including Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
GOES-L, to be renamed GOES-11 once in orbit, will be stored on
orbit ready for operation when needed as a replacement for GOES-8
or 10.

<HEADLINE> Simitis Warns Illegal Immigrants in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
warned here Friday that the illegal immigrants living in Greece
faced deportation if they failed to respect the Greek law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Simitis said that whoever
failed to respect law and order had no place in Greece and must
leave.
</P>
<P>
Simitis' warning came after Greek police Thursday night
successfully dealt with a bus-hijacking incident in northern
Greece, in which an Albanian hijacker armed with a hand grenade
was killed and all hostages were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
This is the second bus-hijacking incident in Greece in less
than two months. On May 29, an Albanian also hijacked a Greek bus
and forced the driver to cross over into Albania where he and a
Greek hostage were shot to death by Albanian special police
forces.
</P>
<P>
Simitis stressed that his government would do everything
possible to secure Greek citizens' safety and linked the presence
of economic refugees in Greece with many aspects of criminal
activity which have appeared in the country in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Greece had in recent years encountered unprecedented criminal
phenomena which were trying the naturally hospitable feelings of
the Greek people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are an estimated 700,000 illegal immigrants
staying in Greece, and most of them are Albanians. In early July,
Greece began to check residence permits or green cards of illegal
immigrants and deport those who have no such permits or cards.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Inaugurates Memorial for World War II Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
inaugurated on Friday a memorial center dedicated to the 642
villagers massacred by troops of Nazi Germany on June 10, 1944, in
Oradour-sur-Glane, a village in Haute-Vienne, central France.
</P>
<P>
Oradour-sur-Glane was reduced to ruins by a unit of the SS Das
Reich armored division, has since then become a symbol of Nazi
barbarity in France.
</P>
<P>
The Germans were apparently taking revenge on the French for
supporting the invasion by allied troops in Normandy on June 6.
</P>
<P>
The massacre of Oradour-sur-Glane was also a focus of
controversy when 12 Frenchmen from the Alsacian region, who served
as volunteers in the German army and took part in the massacre,
were pardoned in 1953 by the government under the pressure of
parliament deputies of Alsace.
</P>
<P>
In his speech inaugurating the memorial center, Chirac appealed
to the countries around the world to draw a lesson from
innumerable acts of violence which took place in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
"It is because the 20th century has been at this point
contrasted by the capacity of creation without limit and the
capacity of destruction, also without limit, that the 21st century
should, by drawing a lesson from the past, become a century of
ethics," said Chirac.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Five weeks after the end of a bitter ethnic war and the
arrival of NATO troops in Kosovo, growing confusion among Western
officials, local politicians and Kosovo's population about who
controls the province is hampering efforts to begin rebuilding its
tattered economy, political structures and social services.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley has
stockpiled nearly as much cash as Vice President Gore,
unexpectedly tightening the Democratic contest even as Texas
Governor George W. Bush, armed with a record 30 million dollars in
the bank, formally announced that he will not take federal money
to finance his primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak told President Clinton
Thursday that Israel would embark on a "serious effort" in the
next several weeks to restart negotiations with Syria, which is
still formally at war with Israel.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Senate killed a Democratic effort to expand the ability
of patients to sue managed-care providers and, in a near party-
line vote on Thursday night, approved a Republican plan to
regulate the companies that provide health insurance for most
Americans.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Boeing's profit surged in the second quarter, topping even
the highest estimates. The aerospace and defense giant's net
income increased to 701 million dollars, or 75 cents a share,
compared with 258 million dollars, or 26 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. The recovery was driven by productivity gains
in the commercial-jet division.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. consumer prices did not rise at all in June, the first
time the inflation gauge has remained unchanged for two straight
months since late 1992.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Strong in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve said
Friday that output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities
rose 0.2 percent in June, as it was in May.
</P>
<P>
The June performance left industrial production rising at an
annual rate of 3.9 percent in the second quarter, the best showing
since a 6.6 percent rate of increase in the final three months of
1997. The growth rate in the April-June quarter this year was
triple the 1.3 percent growth rate of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. manufacturing sector, under the impact of the world
financial crisis for the past two years, has cut sharply into
exports while triggering a flood of cheaper foreign-made goods
into the U.S. market. It has lost 488,000 jobs since March 1998.
</P>
<P>
But the June report on industrial output is the latest in a
number of signs that manufacturing may be emerging from its steep
decline.
</P>
<P>
In June, strength in industrial production was led by a 2.7
percent increase in production of cars and trucks, almost as
strong as the 3 percent rise in May.
</P>
<P>
Other big gains in manufacturing included a 2 percent rise in
home electronics and a 2.7 percent increase in production of
business computers.
</P>
<P>
As a whole, production of durable goods rose 0.4 percent in
June following gains of 0.6 percent in both April and May.
</P>
<P>
However, the strength in durable goods was offset somewhat by
continued weakness in the production of nondurable goods, which
fell 0.2 percent in both May and June.
</P>
<P>
Last month, production of petroleum products, leather, tobacco
and clothing also fell.
</P>
<P>
Output in mining, the category that includes oil and gas
drilling, rose 0.4 percent in June, matching the May increase. But
even with the gains, the operating rate in the mining industry
still remains well below its long-run average because of continued
slack in oil production.
</P>
<P>
Output at the nation's utilities was up 0.4 percent in June,
reflecting big gains in electrical power output.
</P>
<P>
In June, the nation's factories, mines and utilities operated
at 80.3 percent of capacity, down slightly from a May operating
rate of 80.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> More Days Needed for Disengagement: Pak Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Friday said that the
disengagement of the freedom fighters from the Kargil area is not
yet finished and will take some days.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the Foreign Office here,
Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR)
Brigadier Rashid Qureshi said the disengagement from the Mushkoh
sector is to be completed by July 16.
</P>
<P>
As far as the disengagement from Drass and Batalik sectors is
concerned, Rashid said, "it may take some days."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, there were reports that India set the deadline for the
withdrawal of the "intruders" from the whole Kargil area, which
comprises four sub-sectors, at July 16, but Pakistan rejected it.
</P>
<P>
The disengagement started from Kaksar sector on the condition
that the Indians will hold fire for 48 hours, Rashid told
journalists.

ATHENS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Greek Alternate Foreign Minister
Yiannos Kranidiotis on Friday urged the European Union (EU) to
play a more active role in the Middle East peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Kranidiotis said that the
Finnish Presidency of the EU was quite correct in planning a trip
to the Middle East to get a first hand picture of the situation
there.
</P>
<P>
He said that both he and Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou would visit Israel soon for talks aimed at promoting
contacts between Israelis and Palestinians within the framework of
confidence-building measures agreed at the Wye river.
</P>
<P>
Athens has hosted three round of talks between Israeli and

late this year.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Position Toward Cyprus Remains Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece stressed on Friday that its
position toward the Cyprus problem remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Alternate Foreign Minister Yiannos
Kranidiotis said that the Greek position on Cyprus remained
unchanged and the present situation created by force in Cyprus was
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
No matter how much time passed, the struggle to restore
legality in Cyprus would continue, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece remained a guarantor of the security and
existence of Cypriot Hellenism, steadily pursuing the
implementation of the joint defense doctrine and Cyprus's
accession to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots proclaimed a breakaway Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who ordered Turkish
troops into Cyprus in 1974, said last week that the Cyprus problem
ceased to exist after the creation of the "Turkish Cypriot state,"
and that the entire world had to understand the reality of an
independent Turkish state in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Greece sternly criticized Ecevit's statement, saying that his
claims ultimately achieved the exact opposite from the intended
result, confirming the provocative and aggressive character which,
in violation of any concept of law, characterized Turkey's policy.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Remain in Albania After AFOR's Mission Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- NATO will remain in Albania after
its "humanitarian mission" ends, a NATO officer reiterated here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
NATO forces in Albania on "humanitarian mission" (AFOR) is
created by NATO specially to fulfill the aid mission in Albania,
and the North Atlantic Council will consider another NATO force
bearing a new name to be settled in Albania after the AFOR's
mission ends, said Ole Van Holc, a Danish major who was authorized
by the AFOR as a press representative.
</P>
<P>
Van Holc said it is possible that a part of AFOR troops will be
settled in NATO's new force.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the return of Albanian refugees to Kosovo is
coming to an end, as the Tirana Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees said there are just 38,300 Kosovo
refugees remaining in Albania as of July 14.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, General John Reith, the AFOR commander, was
optimistic that the mission of returning Albanian refugees would
be finished by September, but noted that NATO troops would be
still present here.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Kosovo Does not Hurt Baltic Bid for NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Friday that the war over Kosovo would not hurt the bid of the
three Baltic nations to join the North Atlantic Treaty
organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Deputy U.S. Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said that the
Baltic states had good reason to be confident that they would
eventually join NATO.
</P>
<P>
"I reiterated in the strongest terms long-standing U.S. policy;
namely, that the three Baltic states are not only eligible for
membership in the alliance, they are making very real and concrete
progress in that direction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talbott made it clear that the bombing of Yugoslavia over
Kosovo had not tilted the alliance toward southern Europe at the
expense of the north.
</P>
<P>
"No country should be excluded from eligibility for the
alliance on the grounds of either geography or history. The U.S.
and its allies are committed to working with our Baltic friends to
help them get ready to be members of the alliance," Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
"And in the wake of the Kosovo experience, the process of the
open door is not going to slow down, nor is that process going to
tilt to the south of Europe at the expense of the north," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks at a news conference during a
day-long meeting of the U.S.-Baltic Partnership Commission that
include foreign ministers from the three countries.
</P>
<P>
After the air campaign, some analysts believe that NATO may
favor Romania, Bulgaria and other southeastern European countries
in the near future to join the alliance.

<HEADLINE> United Nations Distances Itself from E-Mail Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
sought to distance itself from a U.N. development report which
recommended taxing Internet e-mail to fund global development
project.
</P>
<P>
The 185-member Organization has no plans to impose such a kind
of tax nor has it power to do so, U.N. officials said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Development Program (UNDP), which commissioned the
report, has issued a statement, saying that it "neither advocates
nor supports any so-called global tax, nor any other form of
international levy, as a means of funding development aid."
</P>
<P>
The UNDP statement said that the report is an independent
publication that has separate editorial policies from those of the
U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
UNDP released a 262-page annual Human Development Report
Monday, which suggested to consider imposing a "big tax" on
the use of e-mail to finance global development projects.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Intranets Go Full Tilt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 16 (Xinhua) -- More than half of larger U.S.
organizations had Intranet in place by the end of 1998, according
to a report released Friday by International Data Corporation
(IDC).
</P>
<P>
One out of every four dollars spent on U.S. company Web
initiatives in 1998 was spent on intranets, reaching almost 11
billion U.S. dollars, said the market research firm.
</P>
<P>
Intranets are an integral part of the U.S. business landscape,
and IDC expects the spending on them to increase dramatically as
intranets evolve from a medium to display static content to the
foundation for managing dynamic business transactions and
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Application development and deployment will drive intranet
spending going forward. "Users have recognized the productivity
and cost reduction benefits of having open access to applications
and databases," IDC said. "Companies that extend intranet
infrastructure will continue to see positive returns on their
investment."
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, there are more than 30 million intranet users
in the United States. The cost of adding employee access to
intranets will decline, and extending the intranet to suppliers
and customers will gain momentum as security concerns are
addressed.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Progress Spaceship to Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A Russian Progress M-42 cargo
spaceship Friday blasted off from Baikonur in Kazakhstan, the
first launch since Astana lifted a ban on space launches from the
cosmodrome, Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The space craft has separated from the last stage of the
booster-rocket and rose to the planned orbit, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
It is scheduled to dock with Mir space station at 21:56 Moscow
Time (17:56 GMT) on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The launch marked the resumption of operations at Baikonur.
They were suspended by the Kazakh government following the crash
of a Russian Proton-K booster-rocket shortly after takeoff on July
5.
</P>
<P>
Another satellite, the Ukrainian-Russian satellite Okean-O, is
scheduled to take off from Baikonur on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During two days of orders from Mission Control in Moscow,
Progress will have to perform several maneuvers to rise to higher
orbits.
</P>
<P>
The rendezvous and mooring will be conducted automatically.
However, if the equipment fails, the Mir crew is ready to dock
Progress manually. The cosmonauts have assembled the manual
control system and rehearsed its use, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Progress is carrying materials for shutting down the station,
new components for systems that have run out of their service life
and equipment for the unmanned operation of Mir.
</P>
<P>
The station is expected to remain unmanned until its possible
sinking in the Pacific in March 2000.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a radio antenna made in Georgia, drinking water
and fuel will also be brought to the station.
</P>
<P>
The crew will return to earth at the end of August or the
beginning of September and will leave the station unmanned. If no
funding is found for the continuation of the station's operation,
Mir will have to be downed in March.

<HEADLINE> Chinese in S. Africa Slam Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Chinese
community in South Africa have severely denounced Taiwan's Lee
Teng-hui for his recent separatist remarks.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Johannesburg Friday night, people expressed
indignation over Lee's comment last week that relations between
China's mainland and Taiwan should be handled on a
"state-to-state" basis.
</P>
<P>
Donald Wong, chairman of the Transvaal Chinese Association,
said that Lee is pursuing his own political agenda.  "We Chinese
all over the world shall recognize that whatever Lee Teng-hui is
trying to do is actually for his own personal agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wong said: "If he (Lee) is looking for personal things, he
should not sacrifice the Chinese nation as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yan Wenping, a businessman from Shanghai, told the meeting
that Lee's remarks were the culmination of his separatist
attempts. Yan said it is now clear that Lee is trying to split
China even though by doing so he is definitely to be historically
condemned.
</P>
<P>
Yan also denounced Lee for ignoring the fact that most
countries in the world recognize Taiwan as part of China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yinong, a scholar at the University of Witwatersrand, said
he is not surprised at Lee's comment because Lee is desperate at
the end of his office term.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Lee's efforts to seek independence of Taiwan
would be futile because the reunification of the motherland is a
natural and logical development as China's national strength
grows. The noise made by Lee will by no means change the
historical trend, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The bodies of two Pakistani
troops have been handed over by India to the International
Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) and are to reach Pakistan later
Saturday evening, said a official press release here.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Captain Karnal Sher Kkan and an unidentified
soldier, who were killed in the two-month conflict in Kashmir
between Pakistan and India, will reach Karachi later in the
evening along with an ICRC representative.
</P>
<P>
Over the handover of the bodies, Pakistan has been in a quarrel
with India in which Pakistan blamed India for misusing them for
"propaganda purposes".
</P>
<P>
The Indian side informed that the two bodies are available and
requested Pakistan to offer an formal note of identification
before the bodies being handed over.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were taken to New Delhi instead of being returned at
the loc. where Captain Karnal Sher was killed, and were time and
again shown on the Indian television networks, which is "in
complete violation of international norms and basic human values",
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Discuss Ways to Develop China's Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A number of agronomists from nine
countries including the United States, Britain, France and Japan,
met here today with Chinese colleagues to discuss ways of speeding
up China's agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
The 40 agronomists of Chinese origin or overseas Chinese
agronomists are expected to offer suggestions at a three-day
seminar on "Outline of China's Agricultural Science Development"
which is expected to guide the development of China's agricultural
science over the next 15 years and to discuss major problems
hindering development.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will focus on agricultural industrialization, bio-
technology, animal husbandry in China and elsewhere, farm produce
processing, water-saving agriculture, sustainable development, and
pest control.
</P>
<P>
Han Deqian, vice-minister of Science and Technology, said that
although grain output in China was over 490 million tons last year
and grain supply and demand is on the whole balanced, China has to
improve grain quality and reduce the cost of production.
</P>
<P>
He said that water shortages and pollution in rural areas have
hindered the sustainable development in agriculture and that the
outline is expected to make major adjustments in agricultural
development plans and to push for a new revolution in agricultural
science in China.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the seminar, the agronomists had visited agricultural
bases and agrotechnique development zones in Jilin, Guangdong and
Shaanxi provinces, and had discussions with local agronomists.

BUENOS AIRES, July 17 (Xinhua) -- South American Football
Confederation president Nicolas Leoz has suggested the 2002 World
Cup Finals should be taken away from Asian co-hosts Japan and
South Korea, according to reports reaching here from Paraguayan
capital Asuncion.
</P>
<P>
"If they are withdrawing from everything, then I think it's
logical that they also withdraw from hosting the World Cup," said
Leoz on Friday, apparently referring to the recent walkout by the
Asian delegates at the FIFA Congress in Los Angeles, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Leoz suggested FIFA should let England or Germany take over the
2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Asian Football Confederation threatened to boycott the World
Cup if they are not given an extra berth in the finals. Asia now
has four places in the finals including Japan and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Pak Denied Military Operations Across LoC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday denied that
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Pervez Musharraf has said that
Pakistan troops had been operating on the Indian side of the Line
of Control (LoC).
</P>
<P>
Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf, addressing a press
conference here, brushed aside the BBC report which said that
Musharraf has admitted that Pakistan troops were operating in
India-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The foreign office distributed the text of the interview which
took place on Friday along with the monitoring report of the
Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), which carried the
transcript of the COAS interview with the BBC correspondent Mike
Wooldrige at the LoC.
</P>
<P>
Altaf said an impression has been created that Pakistan troops
crossed the LoC and that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif backed such
operation.
</P>
<P>
Going into the text of the interview, he regretted that the
press ignored the first line the COAS said. "Pakistani troops were
holding positions on the LoC, not across the LoC," Altaf quoted
General Musharraf as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that surprisingly this line is missing. "It was never
reported. It is surprising that any responsible reporter would
misquote anything recorded."
</P>
<P>
Quoting another paragraph from the text of the interview, he
said the COAS repeatedly used the words "on the Line of Control."
</P>
<P>
Coming to the point of the interview where the COAS said "all
are on board", Altaf said that it has been quoted out of context,
and an impression has been created that the prime minister was
part of the operation in the India-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Altaf said that some sentences could be put together to present
an altogether different picture.
</P>
<P>
"The activity of Pakistan troops has been on the LoC in
defensive position against the Indian attacks, as two major Indian
attacks were repulsed in early July."
</P>
<P>
On the aggressive patrolling of Pakistan troops along the LoC,
the spokesman said there are stretches on the LoC where there is
no demarcation.
</P>
<P>
He said it is quite possible that the troops go across the LoC,
which does not mean that they are taking part in action in
India-held Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Korean Chinese Condemns Lee's Separatist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The plot to split the motherland by
Lee Teng-hui, leader of the Taiwan authorities, was doomed to
failure, said a joint declaration released here Friday after a
rally attended by representatives of Korean Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Korean Chinese from Seoul, Inchon, Taejon and Kangwon-do said
in the declaration that in the light of Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, Lee's so-called "special state-to-state" remarks run
counter to the trend of peace and the aspiration of a united
motherland expressed by sons and daughters of the Chinese people
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Meng Zi-bin, a senior leader of the Korean Chinese Community,
said that there is only one China and Taiwan is an inalienable
part of China. Lee's separatist remarks intended to provoke
tension across Taiwan Straits. His recent attempt to split China
is a dangerous move against all patriotic Chinese and of course,
dooms to failure, he added.

Colonel-General Anatoly Sitnov, who is in charge of arms

landing boat, Sitnov said.
</P>
<P>
There are also plans to purchase 100 armored vehicles, 30 T-90
tanks and 24 self-propelled artillery systems.
</P>
<P>
An additional 10 satellites are expected to be bought for

However, actual deliveries will depend on the funding of
defense contracts, but Sitnov was optimistic about the future and
confident that the supplies of new weaponry will gradually grow.

"Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev has carried out presidential
instructions on organizational and personnel matters," he said. "
Later the technical equipment of the forces, including

<HEADLINE> Arrested Chechen Security Minister Freed From Custody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Chechen Security Minister Turpal
Atgeriyev, who was arrested Friday in Moscow for allegedly taking
part in a hostage-taking attack in January 1996, was released
Saturday afternoon, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source told Interfax that "Atgeriyev's
involvement and role in the crimes were not duly studied", and all
charges against Atgeriyev -- gangsterism, hostage-taking and
terrorism -- were dropped.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Atgeriyev has further strained Moscow's already
tense relations with Grozny. In an emergency session, the military
section of the Chechen Council -- the Shura -- has made a decision
to act in accordance with the new situation arising in relations
between Russia and Chechnya, Interfax reported, quoting former
Chechen Foreign Minister Movladi Udugov.
</P>
<P>
Udugov declined to give any details of the decision but said "
most of the speakers regarded the actions of the Russian
Federation as a virtual declaration of war against Chechnya."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Mongolia Visit Successful, Says Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
state visit to the State of Mongolia was a success and fulfilled
the mission of enhancing the understanding, consensus and
cooperation between China and Mongolia, Chinese Assistant Foreign
Minister Wang Yi said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who accompanied Jiang during the three-day visit, made
the remarks en route back to China. Wang reiterated that Jiang's
visit was paid in the year of the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries and on
the eve of the new century.
</P>
<P>
Although the visit is short, he stressed that it was the first
ever Mongolia tour of Jiang, who is the core of China's third-
generation leadership, and the whole tour is rich in contents with
far-reaching impact.
</P>
<P>
Wang commented that the most important result is that both
sides enriched and added new contents into the long-term, stable,
healthy and mutually trusting relationship oriented towards the
coming new century.
</P>
<P>
The most important feature of the visit, as he put it, is that
the mutual friendship and trust witnesses further enhancement.
</P>
<P>
The significance of the visit, he said, is that it starts the
process of an even better China-Mongolia friendship towards the
new century after the two countries reviewed the evolution of
their ties in the past half century.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government in the past years unswervingly adopts a
good-neighborly and friendly policy towards Mongolia in line with
its independent foreign policy of peace and its needs to open up
and consolidate a peaceful neighboring environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Wang said, Jiang clearly expounded China's
set guideline to work for lasting friendship with Mongolia, and
reaffirmed that China respects Mongolia's independence and
sovereignty and the development path chosen by the Mongolian
people. This position has won high appreciation from all walks of
life in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the Mongolian side, after summing up the
beneficial experience from the past, clearly affirmed a friendly
policy toward China. He cited the Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandy as saying in the visit that one of the key elements of
the Mongolian foreign policy is to develop long-term, good-
neighborly and friendly relationship with China. Bagabandy said
that Mongolia will continue to give top priority to the
development of its ties with both the north and south big
neighbors, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Bagabandy also reiterated its support to China's
stance on the Taiwan issue and stressed that Taiwan is an
inalienable part of the Chinese territory. "President Jiang spoken
highly of this stand taken by the Mongolian side," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang commented that the Chinese and Mongolian sides further
consolidate the political basis of their bilateral ties through a
consensus reached on a number of key issues during the visit,
which will definitely provide a solid guarantee to the all-round
promotion of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
On the economic area, Wang said, both the Chinese and Mongolian
enterprises have their own advantages so that they can give play
to each's advantages to enhance mutually beneficial cooperation
for common development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang put forward five-point suggestions to expand the
bilateral economic and trade exchanges and cooperation. "The
response from the Mongolian side is positive," Wang said. Both
countries agreed to actively explore new ways to expand economic
and trade cooperation suitable to each country's national
conditions and in line with equality, mutual benefit and taking
into account of the practical conditions and long-term
perspectives.
</P>
<P>
"It can be said that the visit gives an impetus to the mutually
beneficial cooperation and opens up a broad prospect in the future,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> East Timor's Security Conditions Improved: U.S. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Voter registration for the direct
ballot in East Timor has started amid improved security
conditions, visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State for Asia
Pacific Affairs Stanley Roth said.
</P>
<P>
Roth made the statement to the reporters in Dili, capital of
East Timor, on Saturday after a meeting with East Timor Governor
Abilio Jose Osorio Soares, according to the Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Roth visited a few places in the districts of
Bobonaro and Covalima to observer voter registration activities
which officially began on that day.
</P>
<P>
Roth said the registration process generally seemed to have
started in peaceful conditions but stressed that the local
administrations and communities needed to make additional efforts
to safeguard security.
</P>
<P>
According to Expedito Diaz Ximenes, chief information officer
of the East Timor provincial administration, Roth had told Soares
that the situation in East Timor in general was already conducive
for the holding of the U.N.-sponsored plebiscite scheduled for
either August 21 or 22.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET)'s official
spokesman David Wimhurst Saturday said thousands of eligible East
Timorese voters came to registration centers on the first day of
the registration period between July 16 to August 4.
</P>
<P>
But Wimhurst did not mention the exact number of the eligible
voters.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is organizing a direct ballot in East Timor
to enable the East Timorese to accept or reject a wide-ranging
autonomy offered by the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
A rejection of the autonomy proposal will mean independence for
the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was integrated into Indonesia in 1976 in a move
never recognized by the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Committee Adopts Terms of Reference for Drafting Free Trade Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of the
Committee of Experts, constituted to draft a comprehensive treaty
regime for creating a free trade area in South Asia, have adopted
the terms of reference and a work program for the committee.
</P>
<P>
The terms of reference include defining the scope and coverage
of the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) and the principles for
exceptions, provision of a tariff reduction scheme, identification
and elimination within an agreed timeframe of all non-tariff and
para-tariff barriers, the Kathmandu-based Secretariat of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The terms of reference also cover the identification of
existing trade-inhibiting infrastructural bottlenecks, preparation
of rules of origin, compliance with the World Trade Organization
provisions including Articles I and III of the General Agreement
on Tariff and Trade 1994 and the provision of necessary trade
facilitation measures in the area of customs cooperation, the
secretariat said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
"The terms of reference also provide for special measures that
are necessary in favor of smaller and least developed member
states to meet the objectives of SAFTA," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives and Nepal are the least
developed member states of SAARC, which also groups India,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The terms of reference and work program were adopted after
three-day detailed deliberations from Thursday to Saturday at the
SAARC Secretariat attended by delegates from the seven SAARC
nations.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the first meeting of the Committee of Experts,
SAARC Secretary-General Nihal Rodrigo stated that an open national
debate has been proceeding in the SAARC countries on both the
positive aspects of free trade and its complex ramifications.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the need to be conscious of the inherent economic
asymmetries in South Asia and to contend realistically with
structural impediments, discriminatory practices and trade
imbalances which have contributed to constrain trade within the
region.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Secretariat has been requested to prepare the
preliminary draft of the treaty for discussion at the second
meeting of the committee scheduled to be held from October 26 to
30 this year, the secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
It said the second meeting would also consider tariff and
non-tariff measures and rules of origin; India would prepare the
preliminary draft of the rules of origin for discussion by the
committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee would be reporting to the SAARC Committee on
Economic Cooperation, SAARC ministers of commerce and the SAARC
Council of Ministers while the 11th SAARC summit to take place in
Kathmandu in November this year would review the progress in the
preparation of the treaty and provide necessary policy guidelines,
the secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC leaders had preferred to set up the SAFTA by 2001 but at
their 10th summit held in July last year in Colombo, Sri Lanka,
they deferred the deadline indefinitely. Instead, they decided to
form a committee of experts to draft a comprehensive treaty regime
by 2001 for the creation of a free trade area in the region.
</P>
<P>
SAARC nations have completed three rounds of trade talks under
the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement operationalized since
December 1995, offering over 5,700 commodities for preferential
treatment.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Congolese Rebels to Cease Hostilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has called
on the rebels fighting against President Laurent Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to immediately cease all
hostilities and sign the ceasefire agreement, which was signed by
belligerent countries here last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A declaration by the Finnish Presidency on behalf of the EU
also urged Rwanda and Uganda backing the rebels to convince the
Rally for a Democratic Congo (RDC) and the Movement for the
Liberation of the Congo (MLC) to respect the ceasefire immediately
and settle their leadership differences and sign the agreement
without further delay.
</P>
<P>
The declaration collected Saturday from the Finnish Embassy
here said that "the political credibility of the rebel leaders
depends on their willingness to put the interests of the Congolese
people before their personal leadership ambitions."
</P>
<P>
Finland is the current EU Presidency.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration the EU described the agreement as a crucial
step towards the restoration of peace in DRC and the entire
region, saying that " An end to the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of Congo is essential for the development efforts
undertaken in all the countries militarily engaged in this
conflict.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, EU will follow closely the implementation of
Lusaka agreement and in particular the respect of the ceasefire by
all belligerent countries, and duly take this into consideration
with regard to the development of all aspects of its future
relations with the countries concerned, said EU.
</P>
<P>
EU called on all belligerent parties to strictly abide by this
agreement and to refrain from any action putting it at risk.
</P>
<P>
It said it is ready to consider assistance to facilitate
return of refugees and displaced people, the reintegration of
disaffected soldiers and combatants, national reconciliation and
social and economic rehabilitation of DRC.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of DRC, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angolan defense
minister as well as presidents of Rwanda and Uganda signed the
agreement but the rebel did not sign the agreement because of the
disagreement over who will sign the agreement on behalf of the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
RDC split into two factions in May -- one led by Emile Ilunga
and the other led by Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
The three rebel groups have already said that they will not be
bound by the agreement because they did not sign it.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti PM Pledges Cooperation With Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah said on
Saturday that his government will deal with the National Assembly
(parliament) through cooperation, dialog and understanding.
</P>
<P>
Saad made the remarks while delivering the emir's speech
outlining government policies at the opening session of the new
parliament, which was elected on July 3.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the parliament will cooperate with the
newly-formed government to "work out a comprehensive reform
policy that would put an end to the state of stagnation and revive
hope of optimism."
</P>
<P>
Cooperation crisis triggered by policy differences along with
other factors between the government and parliament led to the
May 4 dissolution of the last legislature.
</P>
<P>
Saad vowed that the government work "will be marked with
effectiveness and determination and with keenness on facing up
challenges and overcoming the obstacles that hampered the
national march."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kuwaiti prime minister stressed that security
remains one of the government's top priorities. He pledged in
this respect more support to the Armed Forces and reactivation of
defense cooperation agreements Kuwait signed with some of the
major western powers after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
On the country's foreign policy, Saad reiterated Kuwait's firm
stand on respecting the principles of sovereignty,
good-neighborly ties, non-interference in internal affairs,
striving for solving conflicts through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, is also keen on strengthening
effective cooperation among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC),
which includes, in addition to Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Kuwait will also adhere to the charter of the Cairo-based Arab
League and boost cooperation with Islamic states and other
friendly nations, Saad said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Gulf Arab emirate will continue to work towards
pushing forward peace efforts in the Middle East on all tracks in
line with the United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah appointed a 16-member
government on July 13 after a cabinet resignation on July 4.
</P>
<P>
Under the Kuwaiti Constitution, the cabinet should resign one
day after the result of the parliament elections is officially
announced.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Specialists and scholars agreed
at a symposium here today that cooperation between Guangdong
Province and Macao should be strengthened after Macao returns to
the motherland in December.
</P>
<P>
Macao has extensive economic and trade relations with many
parts of the world, but is a small territory, short of natural
resources, and has an unbalanced industrial structure that has
hindered its development, those attending the symposium said.
</P>
<P>
It is important for Macao to consider how to become a zone of
southern Chinese economic development along with Hong Kong and
Guangzhou, after returning to the motherland, they said.
</P>
<P>
Several dozen people from Guangdong and Macao attended the
symposium, which was jointly sponsored by the Guangzhou Culture
Exchange Association, the Guangzhou Social Science Academy, the
Macao Fund, and the Macao Economic Society.

PARIS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.N. Civil Administrator for Kosovo Bernard Kouchner
gathered for the first time on Friday a meeting of Transitory
Council of the Yugoslav province, which were attended by two Serb
parties and several ethnic Albanian parties, including the Kosovo
Liberation Army. But the Democratic League of Kosovo led by
moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova boycotted the meeting,
estimating that it was "under-represented" there.
</P>
<P>
-- During his visit to Poland on Thursday and Friday, French
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin asked the Poles to well prepare their
public opinion for an eventual entry into the European Union (EU)
in 2003. The reforms undertaken by the Polish government for
adhering to the EU were welcomed by the European Commission, but
were received with skepticism by the Poles.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac inaugurated a memorial
center on Friday in Oradour-sur-Glane in Haute Vienne, central
France, for the 642 villagers massacred there by Nazi troops in
June 1944. He called on Europe to remain vigilant "so that man
forbid what is inhumane."
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish authorities have banned a book written by a
Turkish journalist, Nadire Mater, who interviewed 42 soldiers
participating in the war against the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
in southeast Turkey over the past 15 years. "The Book of Mehmet"
became a classic as soon as it appeared in bookstores in April.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Deputy Commander of Defense Forces Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Saturday installed and swore in Admiral Widodo as deputy
commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Defense Forces (TNI)
and Vice Admiral Achmad Sutjipto as new Navy chief-of-staff.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration ceremony at the State Palace was also
witnessed by former navy chief of staff Admiral Arief Kushariadi
and Air Force Chief-of-Staff Marshall Hanafie Hasnan.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Widodo was previously Navy Chief-of-Staff and Vice
Admiral Sutjipto Deputy Navy Chief-of-Staff.
</P>
<P>
As Deputy TNI Commander-in-Chief, Widodo is the number two man
in the TNI after Commander-in-Chief General Wiranto who has never
had a deputy.
</P>
<P>
The TNI has not had a deputy commander-in-chief for quite a few
years. The last time it had a deputy commander-in-chief was during
the 1980s when the post was filled by Admiral (ret) Sudomo.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Widodo was born in Boyolali, Central Java, on August 1,
1944.
</P>
<P>
Before becoming deputy navy chief-of-staff, Sutjipto was
Commander of the Indonesian Navy's Western Fleet, a position which
was previously also held by former navy chiefs-of-staff Kushariadi
and Widodo.
</P>
<P>
Sutjipto was born in Bondowoso, East Java, on May 12, 1945.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Textile Exports Decrease Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's textile exports during
the first quarter of 1999 registered a slight decrease compared to
the corresponding period in the preceding year due to
uncertainties in the domestic political situation, an official
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Political uncertainties at home caused some disruption in the
continuity of supply to overseas markets and this, in turn,
prompted overseas buyers to switch to other exporting countries,
said Sudar SA, director of industrial and mineral product exports
at the Trade and Industry Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"A number of our overseas buyers placed their orders with other
countries. But I believe that Indonesia will in the future be able
to make up for its losses," he was quoted by the Antara News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to a monthly report of the ministry, Indonesia's
textile exports in the first quarter of 1999 reached a total value
of 1.35 billion U.S. dollars, down 26.16 percent from 1.83 billion
dollars in the corresponding period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But among all of the country's industrial exports, textiles
remained the top foreign-exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1998/1999 fiscal (April 1 - March 31) the
total value of textile exports was 6.83 billion dollars or down
9.38 percent from the same period in 1997/1998 when the figure was
7.54 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sudar said there was a reasonable hope that during the next few
months, especially in July and August, orders from foreign buyers
would increase.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that during the course of the rest of this year
income from textile exports would be as good as last year although
he could not give specific figures.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's textile exports in 1998 reached a total value of
7.310 billion dollars, slightly higher than in 1997 when the
exports were worth 7.309 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Foreign Minister Arrives in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win Aung
arrived here on Saturday on a three-day official visit to
Bangladesh after concluding his visit to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar minister's visit to Bangladesh is basically a
"familiarization trip," as part of his tour to South and Southeast
Asian countries, Foreign Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
"I am here on a friendship visit to our closest neighbor and
want to discuss with my counterpart bilateral matters and issues
relating to BIMSTEC (Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand
Economic Cooperation forum) grouping of which we both are
members," he told reporters on arrival at the Zia International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
Aung was received at the airport by Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad.
</P>
<P>
There was no major problem or conflict between the two
countries, he said. "Whatever problems we have will be resolved
through discussions... We can live together in a friendly
atmosphere and work for mutual benefit," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Naf river that passes through our countries in a river of
peace and the border between us is also peaceful," he added.
</P>
<P>
Azad said the visit of his Myanmar counterpart offered a
favorable scope to both the nations to discuss various issues
leading to the strengthening of mutually beneficial relationship.
"As neighbors we must have sympathetic outlook for each other's
problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will hold official talks later in the day, and
during his stay in Dhaka, Aung is scheduled to call on President
Shahabuddin Ahmed and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
During the talks the two foreign ministers are expected to
focus on the repatriation of about 20,000 remaining Myanmar
nationals, known as Rohingya refugees, in Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliament Elects Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The newly-elected Kuwaiti
National Assembly (parliament) elected during its first session
Saturday Jassem Al-Khorafi as its speaker.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khorafi, also a prominent businessman and former finance
minister, defeated his predecessor and five-time member of
parliament (MP) Ahmad Abdulaziz Al-Saadoun by 37 votes to 27. One
ballot was deemed void.
</P>
<P>
The total members in the Parliament is 65 after adding the 15
cabinet ministers. Under the Kuwaiti Constitution, cabinet
ministers are considered ex-officio MPs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Justice Minister Mishari Al-Anjari was
elected deputy speaker of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah inaugurated Saturday's
opening session of the country's 9th National Assembly, which was
elected on July 3.
</P>
<P>
The last parliament was dissolved by the emir on May 4 on the
ground that it "misused the constitutional powers in a way not
consistent with the spirit of the constitution."
</P>
<P>
However, opposition figures of the liberal and main Islamic
groupings gained an easy majority in the 50-seat legislature,
marking potential conflicts with the new cabinet controlled by
the ruling Al-Sabah family.
</P>
<P>
The emir, during the inauguration, called for unity and urged
the MPs to join hands with the cabinet ministers to serve and
defend the country, and help fulfill the dreams of all Kuwaitis.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi People Resisting Attempts of Zionism, U.S.: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
said on Saturday that Iraqi people are resisting all attempts of
the Zionism and the "despot of this age: the successive U.S.
administrations."
</P>
<P>
Saddam made the remarks in a nationally-televised speech to
mark the 31st anniversary of the 17-30 July Revolution which
brought the ruling Baath Party to power in 1968.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president accused the successive U.S. administrations
of employing its economic, technological and scientific
potentialities directly on behalf of Zionism, "known for its
hatred and vengeance upon the Arabs, the Muslims in general."
</P>
<P>
Saddam said that Zionists must depart from the occupied
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
"Jews who want to co-live with its (Palestinian) people have a
right as citizens of one country, and those who have emigrated to
it have likewise rights as well as obligations which they must
accept," said Saddam.
</P>
<P>
He added that "as we wish a just peace for all nations of the
world, we ought to adhere to a just peace for our nation regarding
its issues and enemies and to reject surrender and all forms of
humiliation, submissiveness and looking down at it."
</P>
<P>
Saddam cirticized some Arab rulers for their "sensitivity to
telling the bitter truth regarding Palestine," affirming that the
Iraqi people "have to state the truth and act in pursuance of it,
irrespective of the consequences."
</P>
<P>
The president asserted that "the ruler, any ruler, is on his
way to vanish, whereas the people and nation are the historical
forces that can never disappear."

<HEADLINE> Bid to Push S.African Gun Laws "Backfired" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- South African Government
officials admitted that their attempt to "facilitate" the passing
of new gun laws had backfired, the Saturday Star newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Nation Crime Prevention Firearm Program manager James
Oosthuyzen was quoted as saying the so-called draft was in fact
just a working paper.
</P>
<P>
The drafting team had sent out the relevant sections to
stakeholders so that they could add their input.
</P>
<P>
"It is easy to see with hindsight that it might not have been
the best way," Oosthuyzen said on Friday, explaining that the
lawyers and drafting experts working on the bill had decided on
the process.
</P>
<P>
He admitted, however, that the bill was set to go through the
parliamentary process in about three week's time.
</P>
<P>
But the South African Gun-owners' Association (SAGA) claimed
this " excuse is nonsense".
</P>
<P>
"They were just trying to get dubious legislation through as
quickly as possible as they knew we would not accept this kind of
bill. The bill is so flawed, it is unenforceable, and it is full
of silly, non-sensibleness and frivolous regulations," said SAGA
spokesperson Juan de Greeff.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the first time the government has used sneaky and
underhanded methods of pushing gun laws through. They did so
recently with the provision which prevented people from lending
guns to people without licences -- pushing it through in a way
that prevented us from giving our input," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gun Free South Africa chairperson Sheena Duncan, who has not
been given any part of the bill to read, said she believed this
was "very badly handled by the government" and sympathized with
SAGA for not having had enough input.
</P>
<P>
Although much good work had been done on firearm issues over the
past three years, Duncan was concerned that the government had
dragged its feet with this bill and was not rushing it through.

MOSCOW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Saturday successfully
launched a scientific satellite from the Baikonur cosmodrome in
Kazakhstan, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.

<P>
The Okean-O, a joint project of Russia and Ukraine, was sent
into space by a Zenit-2 booster rocket at 06:38 GMT.
</P>
<P>

from Baikonur imposed by Kazakhstan in the aftermath of a booster
rocket crash on July 5.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Russia successfully launched a cargo ship, Progress
M-42, from Baikonur. The spacecraft, carrying food, water, fuel
and equipment, is scheduled to dock with the Mir space station at
17:56 GMT Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. became the first
U.S. company to push its market value above 500 billion U.S.
dollars Friday as the software company's stock price rose strongly.
</P>
<P>
The company's stocks rose 5.06 dollars to 99.43 dollars per
share in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. With more than 5.1
billion shares outstanding, its market value topped 507 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company made the success as it prepares for its 25th
anniversary next year.
</P>
<P>
The rise in market capitalization made Microsoft's founder Bill
Gates one of the world's richest businessmen. At current stock
prices, there would be more than 99 billion dollars under the big
name.
</P>
<P>
By most analysts' estimates, about a third of Microsoft's 30,
000 permanent workers are millionaires, according to the Wall
Street Journal. Top performers hired as recently as 1994 are
likely to have options on shares valued at more than 3 million
dollars while many veterans are worth more than 100 million
dollars or would be if they had wisely kept their stock.
</P>
<P>
Running right after Microsoft is the General Electric, which
was worth about 384 billion dollars based on Friday's stock prices.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Hotels Urged to Raise Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambian hotels and lodges have been
urged to raise their standard for them to be internationally
recognized.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Christon Tembo said here Friday when he
officiated at a general meeting of the Hotel and Catering
Association of Zambia that there was need for hotels and lodges in
the country to raise their standard for them to be internationally
recognized.
</P>
<P>
"The standard in most hotels, lodges, guest houses and other
accommodation establishments are still below par," the
vice-president said. "As we enter the new millennium raising the
standard of accommodation to international standard must be one of
our major goals, this is crucial for tourism," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tembo described the condition of some of the hospitality
establishments as an embarrassment to the country and a great
hindrance to the government' s move to overhaul tourism.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Saturday quoted the vice-president as
saying the hospitality industry was capable of becoming one of the
leading contributors to the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The government was aware of the important role played by
accommodation and catering establishments in the development of
tourism, he said.
</P>
<P>
Without proper facilities and services no tourism destination
would succeed in the promotion and marketing of the industry in
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tembo further urged the organization to assist government in
ensuring that the highest standards were maintained in all
hospitable facilities.
</P>
<P>
He also called on hoteliers to maintain affordable prices if
they were to attract clients in the region.

<HEADLINE> Full Power Supply to be Restored in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese state electricity company
Electricite du Liban has announced that a 24-hour supply of
electricity will be restored to Beirut in two months as workers
are speeding up repair of the Israeli bombed-out power plants.
</P>
<P>
"In 10 days' time we will finish the construction work. And
then we can begin with the electrical work," George Mousawad,
director of the company, told the Daily Star Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks from now, the country can expect 16-18 hours of
electricity per day, he added.
</P>
<P>
But now, residents in Beirut and its environs can only get six
hours of power supply per day and some of them are forced to
resort to their private power generators.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Israel launched the biggest air strike on
Lebanon since its 1996 "Wrath of Grapes" operations to avenge the
cross-border rocket attacks by Lebanon's Muslim group Hezbollah,
or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah claimed it fired Katyushas into
northern Israel, which killed two Israelis, to avenge the previous
Israeli shelling on south Lebanon, which wounded at least six
Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli air raid, which killed 10 Lebanese and wounded
more than 60, also destroyed two power stations, three bridges
and a telephone relay station.
</P>
<P>
The two power plants, 10 kilometers east of Beirut, which were
also targets of the 1996 Israeli blitz, are charged with feeding
the power to the capital and its surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war
against the Israeli occupation troops.

<HEADLINE> Pak Troops Cross LoC after PM's Approval: Army Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has admitted for the
first time its forces operated inside India-held Kashmir and Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif approved the incursions during the two-month
conflict between the two South Asian rivals.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was kept fully informed of the Pakistan army's tactics
at the Line of Control (LoC) from the start of the military
campaign, Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Pervez Musharaff
told the BBC Friday in Lahore, capital of Punjab province,
according to a report of the English daily The Nation on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Sharif and his government had been made fully aware of
the Pakistan army's tactics at the LoC, Musharaff said, "Everyone
was on board."
</P>
<P>
And asked if Sharif had approved the army's tactics, Musharaff,
who is also Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee,
answered, "Absolutely."
</P>
<P>
He claimed there had been a disinformation campaign, by parties
which he did not identify, to create a rift between the military
and the government, an apparent reference to speculation that the
army was acting independently.
</P>
<P>
There was "occasional and aggressive patrolling" by Pakistani
troops on the Indian side, Musharaff said, adding the operations
were intended to "preempt any possible Indian attack on Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Mujahideen operation in Kargil sector in the
India-held Kashmir was a great success and the Pakistan army also
scored a major victory by not allowing any ingression by Indians
across the LoC.
</P>
<P>
Referring to casualty figures, the army chief said, "We know
for sure that Indians have suffered casualties like something
definitely over 1,500 dead and maybe an equal number of wounded
which they are trying to hide," he said.
</P>
<P>
Musharaff said the casualty figure for Pakistan was not more
than 250. "Definitely not, absolutely not, they have not inflicted
that kind of casualties at all (on us)."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Urged to Reverse Economic Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabweans must critically examine
the causes of the country's current economic slide, Vice-President
Simon Muzenda has said, the daily Herald reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government regrets the harsh economic environment
prevailing in the country, Muzenda said at the annual congress of
the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries in Bulawayo, the
country's second largest city on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the major problem lay with the structure of the
economy, which continued to depend heavily on primary production.
</P>
<P>
He said the economy's export basket was dominated by primary
commodities instead of finished products.
</P>
<P>
"We must add value to our primary products so as to increase
the percentage of value added products in our exports. This is a
challenge to both the government and business," he said, adding
that the manufacturing sector was expected to spearhead this
transformation process.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector's increased contribution to exports
was expected to be central in the transformation process of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is disturbing to notice that over the last few years the
contribution of the manufacturing sector has declined from about
25 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product to around 18
percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Exports of manufactured goods had not increased, and in some
sectors they had declined. the challenge was for industrialists
to expand the manufacturing sector and make a greater contribution
to the country's export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda also spoke on the government's policy framework for
industrial development, trade and investment, saying the most
exciting part of the policy was that it was created by both the
government and the private sector through the National Economic
Consultative Forum.
</P>
<P>
As Zimbabwe continued to commercialize and privatize some of
its public institutions, it is important that indigenous people
should get a fair share of the ownership of the assets if the
country is to build a stable society, he said.
</P>
<P>
While the last 12 to 18 months have been difficult for the
economy, there is no cause for despair.
</P>
<P>
"We should redouble our efforts to ensure that we resolve our
problems comprehensively, and improve our economic situation as
soon as possible," said Muzenda.

<HEADLINE> Dnestr Summit Fails to Make Much Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The summit on the issue of Moldova's
breakaway Dnestr region held here on Friday failed to reach an
agreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops from this region.
</P>
<P>
However, a joint statement issued after the gathering, attended
by Moldovian President Petru Lucinschi, Russian Prime Minister
Sergei Stepashin, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and Dnestr
leader Igor Smirnov, said the meeting paved way for the
development process of further mediation on this matter.
</P>
<P>
All the parties agreed to make further efforts to solve the
issue by negotiations, said Kuchma at a press conference after the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma reiterated Ukraine's position as a coordinator on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine will continue to help solve the problem on the basis of
granting a special status to the region while ensuring the
territorial integrity of Moldova, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin said that Russia was drafting a plan to pull out its
troops as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Smirnov said that the region and the Moldovian authority shared
a common wish in normalizing relations although the two sides
remained in disagreement on the status of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-speaking Dnestr region has sought secession from
Romanian-speaking Moldova, resulting in bloody conflicts, which
were halted by the intervention of Russia's 14th Army, still
present in the region.
</P>
<P>
In October 1994, Russia and Moldova signed an agreement for the
withdrawal of the Russian troops but the document has not been
enacted because it failed to be approved by the Russian Duma (the
lower house).
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) also attended Friday's meeting.

<P>
OTTAWA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Fire and explosion in the Bell
Canada building threw part of Canada's biggest city Toronto into
communications chaos Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wide spread disruption began at about 11 a.m., four hours after
a fire and explosion were witnessed in a building of Bell Canada,
the country's largest telephone carrier.
</P>
<P>
For about five hours, callers in large sections of Toronto got
busy signals, while computers linked by phone lines couldn't
communicate properly.
</P>
<P>
The chaos affected banking operation as well, with bank
machines stopping dispensing cash and putting debit card and
credit card users in trouble.
</P>
<P>
Communications disruption were also reported in Ottawa,
Montreal, Halifax and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 firefighters and 14 fire trucks were called to the
fire, which started when someone dropped a tool in an electrical
room, creating an explosion, according to some officials.
</P>
<P>
Telephone service was resumed slowly late Friday afternoon to
more than 100,000 downed lines in downtown Toronto, where 911
emergency lines were disrupted at the worst time of the day.
</P>
<P>
Locals said the chaos was the first they had ever seen in the
past 34 years and "it was a major event that will be talked about

Representatives on Friday approved by 234 to 163 a bill designed
to open wider U.S. markets to 48 sub-Saharan countries.
</P>
<P>
The bill extends a broad range of trade preferences to the
region. Africa, with 700 million people, now accounts for only 2
percent of U.S. trade.
</P>
<P>
The measure would grant duty-free and quota-free treatment to
many products, particularly textiles and apparel, and promote
private investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the trade preferences, the countries would have
to act to establish market-driven economies and not engage in
human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
The House passed nearly identical legislation last year, but it
died in the Senate, partly due to concerns that it could hurt
American textile industry.
</P>
<P>
This year, sponsors are more optimistic about Senate passage.
President Bill Clinton strongly supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky called the House
vote "a vital step toward promoting further economic growth and
reform in Africa." "It is the best opportunity in decades to
create the right relationship with the Africa of the future," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Opponents from textile states lost, by voice vote, a last-ditch
effort to amend the bill to require that African-made products
getting the preferential duty treatment be made from U.S. fabric.
</P>
<P>
Supporters said such an amendment would gut the bill.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Despite with a lineup of NBA
playes, the Canadians were no match for star-studded Team USA,
which used suffocating defense in a 94-60 victory today in the Pre-
Olympic Qualifying Tournament of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
The bigger and quicker Americans limited the Canadians to only
nine baskets in the first half, opening a 44-27 lead. That was a
far cry from the 62-28 halftime bulge Team USA held on Uruguay at
halftime of its opener but still was a commanding advantage.
</P>
<P>
The Americans pulled away in the second half, when they shot 64
percent (21-of-33). They finished at 56 percent (39-of-70).
</P>
<P>
Seattle SuperSonics guard Gary Payton continued his stellar
play with 20 points. San Antonio Spurs forward Tim Duncan got into
the act with 18 points and nine rebounds after a quiet opener.
</P>
<P>
Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kevin Garnett had 15 points and
three blocks and Phoenix Suns guard Jason Kidd handed out 11
assists. Team USA held a 49-39 rebounding edge.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Law Encourages Illegal Cuban Emigration: Cuban Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The basic factors that stimulate
illegal Cuban emigrants to the U.S. are the U.S. blockade and its
Cuban Adjustment Law, introduced in November 1966, which gives
automatic resident status to Cubans arriving illegally in U.S.
territory, the Granma newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
This statement was prompted by a U.S. confirmation that 56
Cubans arrived early Friday at the coast of Florida from Cuba in
three groups.
</P>
<P>
"Cuba has complied strictly and rigorously with all the terms
of the Migratory Agreement" signed in 1994 with the United States,
said the newspaper Granma, the organ of the Cuban Communist Party,
in its editorial.
</P>
<P>
It added that there is no possibility that Cuba will tolerate
any kind of massive exodus and that Cuba will continue its efforts
in "rigorously" carrying out the Migratory Agreement to prevent
mass exodus.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold International Wine Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Wine lovers will be given a great
opportunity later this year in the city of Shenyang in
northeastern China.
</P>
<P>
An international wine festival, perhaps the biggest in this
century, will be held there between October 9 to 18, gathering
together all the well-known brands, from French Napoleon to
Chinese Maotai, as well as some of the heaviest drinkers in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee has sent invitations to countries
throughout the world, asking them to dispatch high-profile
delegations, according to a spokesman of the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
The bacchanal, to be hosted by the China Federation of
Literature and Arts Circles and the Shenyang Municipal Government,
will greet some 10,000 people to taste wine together under one
roof.
</P>
<P>
The event will feature the election of a Miss Wine and a Mister
Wine, folks having not only a great capacity to imbibe alcohol,
but also a profound knowledge of the history of wine.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people began drinking wine about 6,000 years ago
according to some archeologists, and the beverage is now one of
the most important elements smoothing human relations. It is
estimated that hundreds millions of Chinese are fond of drinking
wine.
</P>
<P>
Chinese factories produce four million tons of liquor, 300,000
tons of wine, and 20 million tons of beer annually. One of the
biggest headaches for the Chinese police is dealing with drunk
driving.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the spokesman, the history of wine
represents some fine traditions of Chinese culture, and the
festival will teach people to drink wine in a "healthy, scientific
and civilized" manner.
</P>
<P>
It will also attract foreign investors to improve China's wine
production, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, people from Taiwan's wine industry will be invited
in order to develop the market.
</P>
<P>
Film stars and singers will add some color to the festival,
while Kung-fu masters will demonstrate the art of "drunken boxing.
" And an unprecedented 99-part TV documentary will be filmed
expounding the significance of wine, he said.

<HEADLINE> Machinery, Electronics Export Enjoys Strong Eximbank Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Export and Import Bank of
China (Eximbank)'s strong support has helped push the export of
high value-added machinery and electronics products to grow by 9.9
percent in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The 33.32 billion U.S. dollars export volume of machinery and
electronics products was achieved against a 4.6 percent decrease
of China's overall export in the first six months, according to
official statistics released this week.
</P>
<P>
Policy financial support provided by the Eximbank was a
powerful promoting force behind the export growth of commodities
in the machinery and electronics sector, said a senior official
from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Eximbank was established in 1994 to execute the state's
industrial and foreign trade policies under the leadership of the
State Council. It's main task is to provide policy financial
support to the export of machinery and electronics products, as
well as complete sets of equipment.
</P>
<P>
President of the Eximbank Yang Zilin said that by the end of
May, the Eximbank's export sellers' credit had amounted to 76.29
billion yuan and 104 million U.S. dollars, with the lion's share
channeled to high value-added machinery and electronics products.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the China National Aviation Technology Import
and Export Corporation said that the company has used Eximbank's
loans of some two billion yuan to support its export of aircraft,
enabling the company to achieve profits of 2.68 billion yuan over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The China Great Wall Industry Corp. has used loans of 3.55
billion yuan to support its international commercial satellite
launching, while the China Shipbuilding Trading Company Ltd. used
Eximbank loans of 7.63 billion yuan to support its building of 70
ships for export.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the Eximbank will continue to focus its support
to the export of high-tech and high value-added machinery and
electronics products, while making efforts to improve the quality
of credit assets.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorian Government Negotiates With Transport Strikers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadorian government held
negotiations with striking transport workers Friday in an effort
to end the nationwide traffic paralysis, which has lasted for 12
days as a result of a hike in gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
The strikers urged the government to freeze the gasoline prices
at a lower level for two years.
</P>
<P>
President Jamil Mahuad announced Wednesday that he would
withdraw a 13 percent hike in gasoline prices which he decreed on
July 1 and freeze fuel prices at June levels, but he failed to say
for how long the prices will remain frozen.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad said he withdrew his former decision only to foster
harmony and understanding among the people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this move would cause the poor country to loose
valuable revenues needed to finance a huge budget shortfall.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the authorities and strikers followed a
meeting between Mahuad and Interamerican Development Bank (IDB)
President Enrique Iglesias.
</P>
<P>
Iglesias announced that the IDB wants to help Ecuador surmount
its deep economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the IDB will disburse in the next few days 98
million U.S. dollars in non-reimbursable credits for strengthening
Ecuador's public finances.

WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Teenager Lleyton Hewitt and
Patrick Rafter pushed the United States to the brink of
elimination by sweeping today's singles matches, giving Australia
a commanding 2-0 lead in the best-of-five quarter-finals in the
Davis Cup tournament in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt took advantage of a tired Martin in the first match and
beat the American, 6-4, 6-7 (1-7), 6-3, 6-0, in the blistering
heat.
</P>
<P>
Jim Courier, who continually had shown a penchant for pulling
out crucial Davis Cup matches over the last two years, failed to
deliver today as Rafter prevailed, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it will be up to Pete Sampras to avoid an
embarrassing loss at home for the U.S., but in a doubles capacity.
Although he has not played Davis Cup doubles in two years and has
not won a doubles match this season, Sampras will join Alex O'

<HEADLINE> Latin America Demands Lifting of EU Banana Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The banana producing countries
of Latin America on Friday demanded an end to the restrictive
measures imposed by the European Union (EU) on their banana
exports, one of the main hard currency earners of these countries.
</P>
<P>
Vice foreign trade ministers of Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela,
Mexico and Panama, who are gathered here to discuss the region's
banana crisis, reaffirmed their opposition to the EU banana policy,
describing it as "protectionist."
</P>
<P>
The EU-imposed quotas have sharply diminished Latin America's
banana exports. Panama, one of the most affected nations, has lost
almost 20 percent of its banana production over recent years.
</P>
<P>
There must be equal conditions for the marketing of Latin
American bananas with those produced in the Caribbean, Panamanian
Trade and Industry Ministry spokesman Orlando Kivers said here.
</P>
<P>
The Caribbean banana producing countries, mostly former
European colonies, reportedly benefited from the EU restriction.
</P>
<P>
The EU has refused to lift the quotas imposed on the Latin
American banana producing countries despite calls from the World
Trade Organization, which ruled the restrictive policy as illegal.

BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- China's gross domestic product grew 7.6 percent on a year-on-
year basis during the first half of the year to hit 3.62 trillion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said that the world should be
a multi-polar one for no single management pattern can be
applicable universally.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during his meeting with Chairman of the
Mongolian State Great Hural Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
-- Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui has made himself a sinner in
history by attempting to split the motherland when he redefined
the cross-Straits relations as "state-to-state", said a Xinhua
commentator.
</P>
<P>
Lee gradually tore off his camouflage and changed his policy
towards the mainland from the "one China" principle, the
commentator article noted.
</P>
<P>
 "China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Although the flood-control situation has remained critical
for weeks in China, no severe dangers have been reported on the
thousands of kilometers of levees and dikes along the Yangtze
River, according to the latest reports reaching Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Local anti-flood authorities attribute this to the fact that
many flood-control projects reinforced soon after last summer's
inundations are playing a significant role in withstanding this
year's worsening floods.
</P>
<P>
-- The newspaper carried the full text of an article entitled "
Historical Progress in Guaranteeing Human Rights in Tibet" by
China Society for Human Rights Studies, depicting the real human
rights situation in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing Daily"
</P>
<P>

Huangcun on the outskirts of Beijing became operational recently,
linking up the Beijing-Kowloon and Beijing-Shanghai railways, two
major arteries in China.
</P>
<P>
-- Top leaders of non-governmental organizations in Beijing
continued to denounce Taiwan leader Lee Ten-hui for his "two
states theory". According to reports from Taiwan, on July 9, Lee
said that the cross-Straits relations should be "state-to-state or
at least special state-to-state relations".
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the women, youth, trade unions and religion groups
concluded that Lee's attempt to split the motherland is doomed to
failure.

<HEADLINE> Annan Stresses Need to Reform U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan Friday stressed the need for the world
organization to complete its reform as soon as possible in the
light of NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia without a U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo conflict clearly demonstrated the need for a
reform of the Security Council," he said, adding that "any
decision to use force should involve the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
NATO's military action against Yugoslavia without approval of
the Security Council has prompted many countries to taking "a
critical look at this issue," he said after holding talks with
Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kavan during his three-day visit to the
Czech Republic from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the reform would be completed within between
six months to one year.
</P>
<P>
Currently Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States
hold veto power as permanent members of the Security Council,
allowing any one of them to unilaterally block actions by the
council.
</P>
<P>
It is under consideration that an override of the veto should
be allowed in case one of the five uses the veto for individual
national interests or domestic political concerns.
</P>
<P>
Other proposals on reforming the council include expanding the
board from its current 15 members to more than 20 and having less-
developed countries represented as permanent members.
</P>
<P>
Annan on Friday met with Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman and
other leaders and  discussed crackdown on organized crime and
drug-trafficking and other issues.

<HEADLINE> Eruption of Philippines' Mt. Mayon Still Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said Saturday that the
danger of eruption or a sudden explosion of the Mayon volcano is
still Possible.
</P>
<P>
The sulfur dioxide output from the volcano increased from
Friday's report of 740 tons per day to 2,260 tons per day, the
Phivolcs said in a report, adding that steam emission was also
enhanced from weak to moderate.
</P>
<P>
The varying Sulfur dioxide emission rates measured over the
past days suggest that the Mayon's activity is prone to daily
fluctuations but the overall trend in sulfur dioxide flux is still
well above background levels, the report said.
</P>
<P>
An important probability that may explain the unremarkable
levels exhibited by seismicity and ground deformation during this
period of unrest is that magma may have already ascended to near
the crater surface with an increase in the possibility of
eruption.
</P>
<P>
The Phivolcs maintains Alert Level 2 over the volcano, which is
about 330 kilometers southeast of Manila. The level reminds the
public to keep away from the 6-kilometer radius permanent danger
zone.
</P>
<P>
In the southeast quadrant, the 7-kilometer danger zone is still
in effect, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Athletes Hoped to Break New SEA Records: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
expressed the hope that the Indonesian contingent to the Southeast
Asian (SEA) Games will make better achievements than in previous
regional sports event and break either national or SEA Games
records.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they can make better achievements," the president said
while visiting the Indonesian contingent to the SEA Games at the
Senayan Sports Stadium here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I have heard and seen them. God willing, they can fulfill the
expectation of the Indonesian nation and behave as human beings
with sportsman-like culture," he was quoted by the Antara News
Agency Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, Habibie said, the Indonesian contingent to the SEA
Games could influence the entire Indonesian nation as well as
other peoples of neighbouring countries to subscribe to sportsman-
like attitude.
</P>
<P>
The President said although the Indonesian contingent expected
to become the overall champion they should not precede reality.
</P>
<P>
"For sure, all the Indonesian people from the president down to
villagers will pray for their success," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said the Indonesian contingent should pursue
the achievements not because of rewards.
</P>
<P>
"The achievements should result from the characteristics of
human beings who want to perform their tasks in a good and
sportsman-like manner," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Indonesian National Sports Committee Wismoyo
Arismunandar said the Indonesian contingent had been making good
preparations for the SEA Games in the hope that it could emerge as
overall champion.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is expected to send a 348-strong sports contingent to
the sports event to be held in Brunei Darussalam. They will take
part in 20 different sports branches.

<HEADLINE> China's Peasants Say Good-bye To Open-Air Toilets (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Wu Lincai, a peasant who lives in
east China's Anhui Province, built a two-story house in his
hometown and now can proudly say that he lives like urbanites --
but there's still one difference: his house has no bathroom.
</P>
<P>
Wu is still using the same open-air lavatory as he did when he
lived in the old earthen house. But, he says, maybe this year, and
certainly at least by next year, a WES loan will give him the same
lavatory urbanites have.
</P>
<P>
WES stands for the "Water and Environmental Sanitation" project
of UNICEF. It may not be a household word, but in Wu's hometown,
it is a popular word, because the project has helped peasants to
improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
Open-air toilets have been around for several thousand years in
rural parts of China, where they fouled the environment and were a
source of various intestinal diseases. For provinces that are
trying to get away from poverty, a sanitary washroom is no small
thing.
</P>
<P>
Zhen Huiming, a UNICEF project official, says that since 1994,
UNICEF has cooperated with the Water Conservation Ministry, the
National Patriotic Hygiene Committee, and local governments on the
WES project in 21 poverty-stricken counties in 8 provinces and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Dai Guangqiang, the director of the Anhui Public Health Bureau,
says that what he found hardest was not the money or technology
problems, but changing peasants' ideas and living habits because
open-air toilets have been around for so long.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Peasants Say Good-bye to Open-air Toilets(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of WES's goals is to help peasants change their ideas, Zhen
says. A WES project provides a 6-month to a year loan of 350 yuan
for each peasant family (a new toilet costs 700 yuan) to encourage
them to build better toilets themselves.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNICEF progress report in 1997, China was near
the bottom of the list in sanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has said that it will improve this
situation considerably by the end of 2000. The great gap between
reality and expectations has caused the Chinese government to call
for a "toilet revolution" to thoroughly improve peasants' ideas
about the washroom with a new social system.
</P>
<P>
To reach this goal, the National Patriotic Hygienic Committee
has asked local governments to add another 12 million sanitary
washrooms by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Dai says that by May, Anhui had successfully improved 140,000
rural lavatories.
</P>
<P>
China will hold a work conference on rural lavatory reforms
this month and hopes to make a plan with local governments to
improve lavatories and to get peasants to say good-bye to the open-
air models.

magazine's list of the top 500 companies, according to sources
from the ICBC.

<P>
The ICBC secured this position with an annual income of more
than 21.8 billion U.S. dollars, a spokesman for the bank said,
adding that this is the highest ranking achieved by any Chinese
financial enterprise ever included on the list.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Fortune's choice shows that the ICBC has

increasingly important role in global finance.

<P>
At present, the ICBC has more than 8.1 million corporate
accounts and 420 million individual accounts, with settlement

<HEADLINE> Mexican Players Threaten Boycott over Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Mexican players on Friday
threatened to boycott the Confederations Cup, which their country
is hosting later this month, in support of two team-mates banned
from the Copa America after failing a doping test, according to
reports from Asuncion, Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
"If the players involved are not absolved before the
Conferations' Cup, the members of this squad will not take part in
that event as a sign of protest and a show of unconditional
support," said a statement signed by all members of the squad.
</P>
<P>
Raul Lara and Paulo Cesar Chavez were banned for the rest of
the Copa America one week ago after failing the test.
</P>
<P>
Lara tested positive for testosterone and Chavez for nandrolone
after a first-round match against Brazil on July 3. On Friday,
the South American Football Confederation (CSF) announced that
Lara again tested postive after his team's subsequent match
against Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Marco Teixeira, head of CSF's doping commission, said the
levels found in the tests were four to six times those to be
normally expected.
</P>
<P>
Mexico entered the semi-finals of the Copa America, in which
they are taking part as guests, before losing to Brazil on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Confederations' Cup is a FIFA-organised competition
featuring winners of recent continental championships.

<HEADLINE> Ten Athletes Found to Use Banned Substances in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 16 (Xinhua) - Having made 69 checks in June, the
National Doping Control Commission (NDCC) found that 10 athletes
were using forbidden stimulants, NDCC Secretary Dr Emil Miloshov
told a news conference on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The abusers include five track and field athletes, two junior
cyclists, a rower and two boxers.
</P>
<P>
They all will be given a two-year suspension according to the
Ordinance on Doping Control in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned by the large share of the positive doping
tests. In previous years this share was about 3 per cent. Now it
exceeds 10 per cent," NDCC Chairman Prof. Vitan Vlahov said.
Another fact which arouses concern is that seven of the ten
abusers are young athletes.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in sports schools show that 16-20 per cent
of students use anabolic steroids which promote muscle growth.
Europe has a serious doping problem, that is why a special
international agency for doping control will be established,
Vlahov added.
</P>
<P>
In his words, the doping control in Bulgaria is not as
effective as it should be due to the shortage of funds. Given its
budget, the NDCC can afford only about 300 tests a year.
</P>
<P>
The fact that many Bulgarian coaches do not combat the use of
stimulants causes particular concern, Vlahov said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- French champions Girondins Bordeaux
have signed 14-year-old Croatian Filip Marcic from Hajduk Split,
the club said in Bordeaux on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bordeaux beat Italy's Juventus in the race for the talented
young striker, who was already a member of Hajduk's under-17 side.
</P>
<P>
Their youth scheme, run by former French World Cup defender
Patrick Battiston, bore excellent results last season with victory
in both the French under-15 and under-17 championships.
</P>
<P>
"The titles are not an end. The goal is to produce competitive
teams in which players can progress to play one day play with the
professionals at the Stade Lescure," Battiston said.
</P>
<P>
Guinean striker Pascal Feindouno, a product of the youth scheme,
has signed his first professional contract with the club.
Feindouno scored the winner in Bordeaux's 3-2 victory at Paris St
Germain which secured the first division title in May.

BRUSSELS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Belgium took a 2-0 lead over
Switzerland in their Davis Cup world group quarter-final on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the second singles rubber, Christophe van Garsse defeated 17-
year-old Roger Federer 7-6, 3-6, 1-6, 7-5, 6-1 after Xavier
Malisse's earlier winning over Lorenzo Manta 6-4, 6-0, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
Belgium played in the final in their first appearance in the
competition in 1904. But their best performance since the
introduction of the world group in 1981 has been a quarter-final
place last year.
</P>
<P>
Swiss team captain Cladio Mezzadri felt his player had been
unlucky. He refused to be drawn on whether he would make changes
for Saturday's doubles and the return singles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Malisse is due to partner former French Open semifinalist Filip

<HEADLINE> Annan Proposes Large U.N. Peacekeeping Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday recommended a "large and expensive" peacekeeping
mission for Congo (K), saying that up to 90 military observers
should be deployed immediately.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the 15-nation Security Council, Annan said
that in order to be effective, "thousands of international troops
and civilian personnel" as well as 500 military observers would
eventually be needed to help maintain a ceasefire in the central
African country.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. chief did not give numbers for a potential
U.N. force that other officials have estimated at 10,000 to
20,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Six African countries involved in the 11-month conflict in
Congo (K), or the Democratic Republic of Congo, signed a peace
agreement last week in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, but rebel
leaders refused to do so because of a split within their ranks.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that initially, the 90 military observers, together
with some civilian political and humanitarian staff, should be
authorized to go to Congo (K) as well as serve as liaison officers
to the main belligerents in the war.
</P>
<P>
Annan warned in his report that a purely military solution to
the conflict was not possible in light of recent failures to
impose one by so many other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he would report back to the Security Council once he
had reviewed the situation on the ground in light of reports from
his military observers.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that "even at this stage, I foresee the need
for program for the establishment of a well-funded, well-planned
and long-term program for the disarmament, demmobilization and
re-integration into society of the former combatants."
</P>
<P>
Annan has concluded his six-nation Africa tour on July 14,
sending a strong message that the United Nations, with its
failure in peacekeeping operations in Angola, will not abandon
Africa, long haunted with conflicts and poverty.

NEW YORK, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks continued
to rise Friday, pushing a number of indexes into record
territories
</P>

The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 23.43 at
11,209.84, surpassing the record closing high of 11,200.98 set
on Monday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 9.16 at 1,418.78
and the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 25.11 at
2,864.48, setting new highs both.
</P>
<P>
The stocks advanced mostly today as investors still enjoyed
the good news about inflation. Thursday's Labor Department
report on the flat Consumer Price Index in June for the second
consecutive month pushed stocks higher on that day because it
put to rest investors' worries that the Federal Reserve might
need to raise interest rates again to avert inflation.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 2.37 at 663.12. But the
American Stock Exchange index fell 3.63 at 818.10 and the
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.54 at 465.26.

<P>
Advancing issues was virtually even with decliners on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,478 up, 1,476 down and 603
unchanged.

<P>
KAMPALA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A visiting German minister said
here Friday that her country supports any initiative to end the
war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Maria Wieczorek-Zeul, German Minister for Economic Cooperation
and Development, made the remarks at a press conference here
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on African countries to settle their
differences by peaceful means so as to reduce their military
expenditure, therefore much money can be used for social welfare,
education and other things to make a better future.
</P>
<P>
"I was born during the Second World War, I deeply know the war
disaster," she said, adding "I am assured any conflict should be
solved and can be solved."
</P>
<P>
During her visit to Uganda, Wieczorek-Zeul and Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni held talks on issues pertaining to
developments in the region in light of the just signed ceasefire
agreement in the DRC and bilateral trade and economic cooperation,
according to the presidential office.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 to 1999, the German government provided Uganda with
81.5 million Deutsche marks (about 42.9 million U.S. dollars) for
projects of water, road, infrastructure and vocational training.
