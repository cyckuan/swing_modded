<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua)- - Flooding in Russia's far east has
left thousands of people homeless and caused an estimated 29
million U.S. dollars of damage, the regional civilian defense and
emergency department said.
</P>
<P>
The department warned that the floods show no signs of easing,
with heavy rain still falling. A violent typhoon is forecast to
sweep the area in mid August.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain since the beginning of August has caused many
rivers in the north Primorye and southern Khabarovsk regions to
burst their banks, flooding some 13,000 square kilometers of land
inhabited by more than 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Three villages were cut off and more than 40 villages were
partially submerged, the department said.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Ends Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 12 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan today
ended his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia and left the Saudi Red Sea
port city of Jeddah for home, the Kuwait News Agency KUNA reported.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, King Hussein held talks with his Saudi
Arabian counterpart King Fahd on the Middle East peace process and
bilateral relations, KUNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian sources were quoted by the agency as saying that
King Hussein's visit was successful and helped set the basis of
closer cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the visit succeeded in overcoming all the
previous tension harassing the two countries in the past six
years since 1990 when the relations between them worsened because
Jordan stood on the side of Iraq during the Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
They said the two sides agreed on supporting the peace process
in the region on the basis of the already signed accords, the
land-for-peace formula and the relevant United Nations Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The two monarchs also agreed to promote bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein arrived in Saudi Arabia Sunday evening and
received a warm welcome by the Saudi leaders.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the kings of the two Arab neighbors
to hold a face-to-face talk on matters of common interests in six
years.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein visited Saudi Arabia in February this year, but
the Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz was the highest
Saudi leader he met at that time.

<HEADLINE> Lebed Slams Condition of Russian Troops in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian security chief Alexander
Lebed today criticized the conditions facing Russian troops in
Chechnya, condemning their equipment as "unimaginably bad" and
"even worse than that of Soviet Union resistance fighters in World
War II."
</P>
<P>
He said Russian soldiers in Chechnya are dog-tired and morale
is at rock bottom. He supported withdrawing Russian federal troops
from the republic, where separatists have been fighting soldiers
sent in by Moscow since December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, headed by Lebed, looks set to take over
Russia's management of the 20-month conflict. Lebed, who returned
to Moscow on Monday after talks in Chechnya with separatist leader
Aslan Maskhadov, said President Boris Yeltsin will issue a decree
to allow the Security Council to take command of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The decree will instruct relevant departments to provide troops
with technical support and authorize the Security Council to
assess the situation in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the Security Council also criticized Russia's
State Commission on Chechnya (RSCC), headed by Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, for doing little to settle the conflict,
saying that it had made no progress either politically or
militarily.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, Yeltsin's personal envoy to Chechnya, went to the
republic on Sunday to try to end the fighting in the capital
Grozny in which 169 have been killed and several hundred wounded
since last Tuesday when separatists stormed the city to wrest
control from Russian government troops.

Doutriaux said.
</P>

Violences took place Sunday in Dherinia, southeast of the East
Mediterranean island state, between Greek Cypriot demonstrators,
police and Turkish Cypriot armymen on the line of separation

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Opposition's Bid to Remove Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The opposition ZANU (Ndonga) is
appealing for funds which it says it wants to use to remove the
ruling ZANU PF government from power through the courts.
</P>
<P>
A ZANU (Ndonga) spokesman said here today Zimbabweans should
be brave and face up to the need to change the government.
</P>
<P>
''We of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) have
accepted the proposition that the government must go if we are to
avoid the disastrous consequences which will cripple this country
nationally, socially, economically and politically unless
something is done immediately.
</P>
<P>
"The present social upheavals are sufficiently indicative of
the evil days that lie ahead,'' said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said his party had engaged a South African law firm to
fight the ruling party's use of its name over the last 16 years
which, he said, was just the beginning of the change of the
government.
</P>
<P>
In addition, ZANU (Ndonga) had engaged a firm of lawyers to
fight the government on the allegations that its leader
Mdabaningi Sithole had a plot to assassinate President Robert
Mugabe. Sithole's trial is expected to begin in November.
</P>
<P>
''The government already regrets the serious charges they made
publicly and for the last nine months they have not been able to
lay the evidence at the feet of Sithole,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
''But to carry out this absolutely necessary legal process, we
need huge sums of money. We therefore appeal to you to make the
necessary contributions to our national cause,'' said the
spokesman.

</P>

The Afghan government will send a delegation next month to

</P>
<P>
Both countries agreed to put an end to propaganda against each
other on the official level.
</P>
<P>
To realize the mutual objective of enhancing political and
economic cooperation, both sides agreed on the formation of two
working commissions which will focus on trade with Central Asian
Countries.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed to give priority to the realization of the

ensuring the administrative and political unity of the country and
at bringing peace and security to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan recognizes and affirms that it is for the Afghan
people to decide among themselves upon a solution that will bring
peace and stability to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed their continued support for the efforts of
the UN, Organization of Islamic Conference, and the regional
countries to help the Afghan people to restore peace.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> France Urges Countries Not to Block Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- France is urging India and six
other developing countries not to block a draft treaty banning the
testing of nuclear weapons so that it can be signed at a United
Nations meeting in September.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette has sent personal
letters to Cuba, Sri Lanka, Mexico, Egypt, Kenya and Indonesia,
countries it says are reluctant to agree to the sending of the
draft Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) from the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva to the United Nations (UN) General Assembly
in New York for signing.
</P>
<P>
It was particularly important for the six nations to "join in
the consensus in favor of the transmission of the text to the
United Nations," Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman Yves Doutriaux
today quoted the letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that France is in "close and constant
contact" with India through the French embassy in New Delhi and
the UN meetings in Geneva to persuade it to accept the draft
treaty.
</P>
<P>
India has indicated that as a sovereign country, it has the
right to reject the treaty.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said that these member countries of the Geneva
Disarmament Conference are bound by a UN resolution to facilitate
the transfer of the draft treaty to New York in the nearest days
to assure its due signing.
</P>
<P>
``What we explained to India as well as the six countries is
that the transmission of the text from Geneva to the UN in New
York in itself does not bring any kind of attack on the
sovereignty of these states,'' said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Iran to File Suit against US at Hague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today its
Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif is to lodge a law
suit against the United States in the international court of
justice at the Hague.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi following the statement of Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati on Iran's decision to go to arbitration in
protest against the U.S. violation of international conventions,
</P>
<P>
"Iran would lodge complaint over the U.S. interference in
Iran's internal affairs with the International Court of Justice
at the Hague," the spokesman was quoted by the official news
agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the allocation of 20 million U.S. dollars by the
U.S. House of Representatives to be spent on subversive operations
against Iran is in contradiction with the international
conventions recognizing the independence of states and prohibiting
interference in the affairs of other nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. covert program, aimed at moderating Iran's Islamic
regime, was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in
December and approved by the White House.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he noted, the U.S. legislation against Iran
is also in violation of the accord signed in Algeria in 1981 by
Iran and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the Iranian complaint formulated in accordance
international laws also included the U.S. legislation on
intensifying the embargo on Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. policy is not in conformity with the current
situation in the world and if the U.S. failed to abide by the
international conventions, it would be further isolated.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the D'Amato-
Kennedy bill into a law to punish non-American companies which
make new investments of more than 40 million dollars annually in
Iran's and Libya's oil sectors.
</P>
<P>
The move, which sparked international criticism, came after
Washington failed to convince other countries to join its
unilateral economic embargo on Iran in June 1995.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Has High Maternal Death Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has one of the worst
woman and adolescent health records in the world with a maternal
death rate of 8-16 per 1,000, an infant death rate of 5-100 per
1,000 and a childhood death rate of 110-150 per 1,000, according
to experts.
</P>
<P>
The case of the maternal and child death rates is attributable
to ''lack of information and education, inaccessibility to health
services, harmful reproduction behavior, deficiency in adolescent
reproductive health and poverty,'' Abdulkadiri Suleiman,
Executive Director of Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria,
said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Suleiman said the worst hit victims are rural communities,
uneducated women and house maids in the northern states of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Other factors identified by him include early marriages and
childhood pregnancy among girls aged between 10-19.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called for special attention and efforts in order
to improve the health status of women and children in these
disadvantaged states of the north.

PARIS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's new Foreign Minister Luc
Bukingama will arrive here from Brussels today for a private stay,
Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted the Burundi embassy in Paris as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman Yves Doutriaux said
today that Bukingama will meet with high officials of the French
Foreign Ministry, representatives of the Burundian community here

Bukingama said in Brussels today that the economic sanctions
imposed by Burundi's neighboring countries "serve the cause of
extremists."
</P>
<P>
"The economic sanctions serve the cause of extremists and
directly affected the Burundian population, instead of
reestablishing peace in the country.... This is the first time for
a country which has never threatened its neighbors to be put under
economic reprisals," AFP quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Paris is

Burundi and "shares the preoccupation on the subject by several

"This question should be studied urgently and very
attentively," said Doutriaux.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects US D'amato-Kennedy Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has lashed out the U.S.
D'amato-Kennedy bill issued recently to punish foreign companies
investing in Libya and Iran as illegal measures which violate the
international law and the U.N. charter.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Sahaf said in a statement
to the Iraqi News Agency that Iraq, which has been suffering from
the U.S. foreign policy that conflicts with international law and
norms, joins other states in rejecting the unjust American
behavior.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. legislation, he pointed out, is seen as belittling
the world community at large. It reveals Washington's intentions
and policy that aim to tighten the noose on world states,
especially those in the southern hemisphere, he said.
</P>
<P>
It also seeks to force sovereign states to take part in the
crime of imposing embargoes on other independent and sovereign
states or peoples because they reject America's interference and
hegemony, he added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the new American law reflects
the great contradiction of the U.S. policy. It conflicts in letter
and spirit with provisions of the world trade agreement that
seeks to guarantee free trade among states as well as the flow of
capital and investment into these countries, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Firms Boost Motorcycle Making, Marketing in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-invested motorcycle plants
are mushrooming around Vietnam, increasing the marketing of the
vehicles by one-fifth annually on the average in the last five
years in the country.
</P>
<P>
The number of motorbikes will reach 10 million by 2005 from
currently four million in Vietnam, local press predicted today.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 70 motorbike making and assembling plants
in the country, with a designed capacity of more than 500,000
units per year altogether but most not in full operation due to
limited quota on imported parts.
</P>
<P>
Currently Japan-based Honda Motor company accounts for 80
percent of Vietnam's motorcycle market, while other Japanese,
German and Taiwanese firms altogether hold four to seven percent
of the market shares.
</P>
<P>
Honda recently has reached a deal with the Vietnamese
Engineering and Agricultural Machinery Corp. over building a
motorcycle joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Asian Honda Motor company in Thailand has also
decided to build a motorcycle plant in the northern province of
Vinh Phu.
</P>
<P>
The plant, planned to open in 1997 with an original capacity of
200,000 units annually, will localize 10 percent of motor parts
during the first seven years then 75 percent from the eighth year
onwards.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Yamaha motorbike maker now is waiting anxiously to get
license from the Vietnamese government for building a motorbike
factory worth 100 million U.S. dollars, with a target to sell
200,000 units annually there by 2006.
</P>
<P>
Yamaha was expected to sell about 5,000 sport models in Vietnam
this year, raising its market shares to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-based Vmep motorcycles are also fairly popular in
Vietnam due to its special design and cheaper price. Vmep has
invested 100 million dollars in building two motorcycle projects
in the northern Ha Tay province and the southern Dong Nai province.
</P>
<P>
The two projects will produce 80 percent of motorcycle parts
locally by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government stipulates that all foreign-invested
motorcycle firms should produce five to 10 percent of parts
locally in their first five years of running, then raise the
proportion to 60 percent from the sixth year onwards.

<HEADLINE> India's Stand on CTBT Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Delhi, August 12 ( Xinhua) -- India has told the U.S. that
it would continue to oppose the present draft of Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and relentlessly press for elimination of
all nuclear weapons within a clear time-frame, official sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Indian stand was conveyed to the U.S. Ambassador to India
Frank Wisner when he called on External Affairs Minister
I.k. Gujral on August 9 to hand over a letter by U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the U.S. ambassador, Gujral reiterated
the Indian position that the Entry Into Force provision in the
CTBT draft should be suitably modified.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to his Indian counterpart, Christopher urged
India to refrain from blocking the CTBT text, while seeking to
assure that the U.S. would not be resorting to any coercive action.
</P>
<P>
While taking note of the U.S. bid to allay fears that it would
subject India to coercion over non-ratification of the treaty, the
Indian foreign minister said that a bilateral guarantee by
Washington would just not meet New Delhi's concerns.

Young-sam held talks with his Sri Lankan counterpart Chandrika
Bandaranaike Kumaratunga here today, during which they discussed
ways to improve bilateral relations and cooperation in
international organizations such as the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Kim expressed satisfaction about the rapid
growth in bilateral trade and voiced his hope that South Korea
will be able to contribute to the economic development in Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
He also asked for the Sri Lankan government's active

South Asian country's infrastructure projects including
telecommunications, electricity generation, steel and road
construction.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga expressed the hope that the South Korean government

<HEADLINE> Iran Extends Deadline for Surrendering Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme leader Ali
Khamenei today issued an order to extend the deadline for
surrendering illegal arms and ammunition for another two months.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Khamenei decreed
the extension at the request by Judiciary Chief Mohammad Yazdi.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei had granted amnesty for those possessing illegal arms
and ammunition who hand them over to the police stations
before the new deadline expires on August 12.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian security authorities Sunday launched a nationwide
publicity through radio, television and newspapers for collecting
illegal arms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry announced that the deadline for
delivering the illegal arms to law enforcement agencies would
expire at 24:00 hours local time on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati said earlier that the
decision to collect the firearms and ammunition was made by the
Supreme National Security Council (SNSC).
</P>
<P>
Besharati said those who hold illegal firearm can step forward
and surrender them to law enforcement agencies without facing
charges.
</P>
<P>
Iranian reports said that some 35,000 illegal arms have been
surrendered to the security departments throughout the country in
the past 50 days.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made the first order in February this year, asking
all Iranians who are in possession of weapons to hand over them
while offering amnesty to those who are pursued for smuggling of
arms in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Iraq war(1980-1988) gave rise to rampant arms
smuggling in Iran. Arms are both smuggled in and out of Iran
through its border with Iraqi Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
Light weapons produced by Iran's defense industries are rumored
to be smuggled out of the country because of corruption and poor
management in government bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
The sources here say that arms smuggling has always gone hand
in hand with narcotic trade. Iran's drug dealers are said to have
the state-of-the-art weaponry and have on occasion overwhelmed
Iranian anti-narcotic squads with their superior firearms.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling of arms into the country is also attributed to
the main armed opposition to Tehran government by the People's
Mojahedin of Iran (PMOI), a group with bases inside Iraqi
territory.

SEOUL, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) today returned to South Korea the body of a

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Israel National Oil
Compamny (INOC) has reported that a new flow of oil near the Dead
Sea had been discovered, but it is not clear whether it will
become a viable commercial resource, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
INOC Managing Director Yaron Ran said today, "We opened
another formation in the depth of 1950-1960 meters, and from that
formation we have had in the last three days around 450 barrels a
day."
</P>
<P>
Drilling has been in progress for nearly two years at a site
near the Arad Highway leading down to the Dead Sea. Oil was first
struck under 2000 meters, and last week the INOC struck again.
</P>
<P>
Ran said that the oil is usable although it may not be in very
good quality.
</P>
<P>
He said that after search for years, INOC is concentrating its
drilling activities in two belts, one along the coastal plain
from the Gaza Strip to Ashdod and another near the Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
In the Dead Sea area, drilling has been conducted at a site
near Arad and in a valley beneath Massada. This area is in the
long run described as promising.

BAGHDAD, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Justice Minister Sevket
Kazan and Education Minister Mehmet Saglam and some foreign
ministry officials arrived here today for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During their stay here, the Turkish officials will hold talks
with their Iraqi hosts on means of boosting bilateral relations in
the fields of trade, economy and politics after Iraq signed with
the United Nations an oil-for-food deal in May.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Turkish officials are also expected to discuss the
implementation of para 50 of U.N. charter in a bid to persuade
Baghdad to compensate Turkey for its economic and trade losses as
a result of the U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion
of Kwait.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has claimed that it has lost a total of 30 billion
U.S. dollars since the imposition of the U.N. trade embargo on
Iraq six years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish officials will also inform the Iraqi side of a
suggestion made by Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan during
his visit to Iran to hold a summit meeting to be attended by
Syria, Iran, Iraq and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The four sides will try to seek a solution to the Kurdish
problem which is the headache of the four countries where the
minority Kurds are striving for their own autonomous homeland.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for high level Turkish officials to
visit Iraq since the end of the Gulf War in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Fail in Attempt to Rob Money from Bank Truck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A number of gunmen opened fire at
an armored bank truck but failed to rob the money it carried today
in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place on a highway some 12 kilometers from
St. Catherine's Monastery, one of Egypt's tourist attractions,
according to the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
The gunmen were Bedouins, nomadic tribesmen in Sinai, MENA
quoted a security source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nobody was injured in the incident and the gunmen fled after
failing in their attempt.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether the robbery had anything to do with
Moslem fundamentalist militants, who have robbed banks from time
to time in order to fund their activities against the government.
</P>
<P>
Militants have been trying to install strict Islamic rule in
Egypt since 1992 through a violent campaign against the
government.

<HEADLINE> WFP Humanitarian Aid to Burundi Allowed amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania decided today to allow
the World Food Program (WFP) to deliver humanitarian food aid to
Burundi under economic sanctions, a move welcomed by the Untied
Nations body.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the same spirit of cooperation will prevail among the
other countries of the region to ensure that humanitarian relief
operations are not derailed as a result of sanctions," said Ms.
Catherine Bertini, the WFP Executive Director, in a press release
reaching here today from Rome.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in a verbal note to the WFP which was made available
to Xinhua here today, the Tanzanian Foreign Ministry also
demanded special U.N. marks be put onto the trucks which would be
under inspection at the Tanzania-Burundi border.
</P>
<P>
The East African countries, including Tanzania, Kenya and
Uganda, have been imposing economic sanctions on Burundi's
military government which came to power on July 25 after ousting
civilian President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. body, an estimated 300,000 people
depended on WFP's relief efforts. Over one month of food supplies
remained inside Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, WFP officials said the fuel situation was even
more critical.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 2,000 tons of WFP humanitarian aid have been
blocked at Kigoma, on the shore of Lake Tanganyika. This aid was
destined for refugee camps in eastern Zaire and the internally
displaced people in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
An additional 3,000 tons of WFP aid were delayed in the
Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam and Isaka, a town about 350
kilometers from the border with Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Under contingency plans, WFP prepositioned six trucks of aid
at Isaka, which are not expected to enter Burundi until Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the WFP was still worried that once transport
operations were shut down it would require a long time to restart
them.
</P>
<P>
It was also concerned over the decision by the Kenyan
government not to allow WFP to fly its passengers' flight to and
from Burundi.

<HEADLINE>   Turkey Expresses Sorrow over Violence in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Acting Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller today expressed sorrow over
the violence along the Green Line in Cyprus that left one
Greek Cypriot dead and some others injured.
</P>
<P>
However, he described the events as serious provocation from
which Turkey would not back down.
</P>
<P>
Ciller told reporters here that the events should be
interpreted in the light of lacking international recognition for
the "borders" of northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot man was killed Sunday by the enraged Turkish
Cypriots in an anti-Turkish demonstration. Turkish troops in
northern Cyprus used plastic bullets to disperse the Greek
Cypriot demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Northern Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas blamed the Greek Cypriot
authorities and the church for instigating the violence in
the past month.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Democratic Left Party (DSP) Chiarman Bulent Ecevit
said that the attempt by a group of young bikers to force their
way across the Green Line which divides Cyprus into a Greek south
and a Turkish north was the first to break the peaceful order
maintained for 22 years on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
True Path Party (DYP) deputy Chairman Mehmet Golhan told
reporters: " The olive branch that we put forth symbolizes
our wish to attain peace. It should never be interpreted as
weakness of Turkey."

<HEADLINE> Iran Files Law Suit against US at Hague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran today lodged a law suit
against the United States in the international court of justice at
the Hague.
</P>
<P>
The state-run television IRIB reported in its evening English
program that the Iranian complaint was lodged by Deputy Foreign
Minister for Legal and International Affairs Mohammad Javad
Zarif.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi following the statement of Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati on Iran's decision to go to arbitration in protest
against the U.S. violation of international conventions.
</P>
<P>
"Iran would lodge complaint over the U.S. interference in
Iran's internal affairs with the International Court of Justice
at the Hague," he was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the allocation of 20 million U.S. dollars by the
U.S. House of Representatives to be spent on subversive operations
against Iran is in contradiction with the international
conventions recognizing the independence of states and prohibiting
interference in the affairs of other nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. covert program, aimed at moderating Iran's Islamic
regime, was passed by the House of Representatives in December
and approved by the White House earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he noted, the U.S. legislation against Iran
is also in violation of the accord signed in Algeria in 1981 by
Iran and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the Iranian complaint formulated in accordance
international laws also included the U.S. legislation on
intensifying its embargo on Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. policy is not in conformity with the current
situation in the world and if the U.S. failed to abide by the
international conventions, it would be further isolated.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the D'Amato-
Kennedy bill into a law to punish non-American companies which
make new investments of more than 40 million dollars annually in
the oil sectors of Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The move, which sparked international criticism, came after
 Washington failed to convince other countries to join its
unilateral economic embargo on Iran in June 1995.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Confirms Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today confirmed hotel magnate Sol Kerzner had contributed 2
million Rand (about 450,000 US Dollars) to the African National
Congress (ANC) for its 1994 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also said there would be no apology for the sacked
deputy minister Bantu Holomisa, who was called liar by the ANC
when he exposed the Kerzner donation last month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a visit to Soweto outside
Johannesburg, Mandela said: +even if there was anyone in the ANC
who will recommend that an apology be made (to Holomisa), i will
over-rule it.+
</P>
<P>
Holomisa, dismissed by Mandela as deputy environmental affairs
and tourism minister last month, demanded at the weekend an
apology from the ANC after Mandela admitted that Kerzner had made
a substantial donation.
</P>
<P>
The Kerzner donation had been the center of a two-week war of
words between senior ANC members, including Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki, and Holomisa, who was facing an ANC disciplinary
inquiry for allegedly bringing the party into disrepute.
</P>
<P>
When asked why the ANC had branded Holomisa a liar, Mandela
said today that ANC Deputy Secretary-General Cheryl Carolus could
be excused for denying the claim, because she was not aware of it
at the time.
</P>
<P>
+Even the treasurer general of the ANC didn't know where the
money came from,+ said the president, but adding the amount was
one of large sums of money ANC had received from business and
other donors, both locally and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also stressed that an agreement had been reached
between him and donors, during the fund-raising campaign, that
their names, and the amounts donated, would not be published.
</P>
<P>
The donors stressed they were giving the money not to the ANC,
but to a cause aiming to defeat apartheid, and toward creating a
non-sexist and democratic South Africa,+
</P>
<P>
Kerzner faces possible prosecution on bribery charges in the
Eastern Cape, for allegedly bribing former Transkei Prime
Minister George Matanzima in the mid-1980s for exclusive gambling
rights in then nominally independent homeland.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela further denied Holomisa's allegation that the
Kerzner donation was to pave the way for withdrawing the bribery
charge once the ANC was in power.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his stance of non-interference in the country's
judicial system, saying no pressure had been brought against the
Eastern Cape Attorney-General to drop the charge against Kerzner.

<HEADLINE> 750 Civilians Released by Rebels in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 750 civilians have been
released from rebel captivity in Sierra Leone's second largest
city of Bo as ongoing peace talks continued in the war-torn West
African state.
</P>
<P>
"We were shocked when groups of people came flocking into the
town, some looking frail," said a traditional leader, Paramount
Chief Joe Demby who is also one of the mediators in the peace
talks, in a telephone interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The Bo city authority is probing the background of the
released civilians who were mainly women and children from
former rebel-held villages in the south, said the chief.
</P>
<P>
During the past two weeks, over 581 people including former
rebels have been released in the south and east. Most of them
want to resettle in the villages from where they were abducted
about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In another development, diplomatic sources in Freetown said
today that the British aid organization, Overseas Development
Agency, last week provided 1.5 million U.S. Dollars for the
Sierra Leone government's demobilization program of the former
rebel soldiers.
</P>
<P>
And the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has also
provided 500,000 U.S. Dollars for the same program.

<HEADLINE> Internet Banking Threatens Traditional Banks' Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The market for Internet banking
is poised to grow sharply in the next three years, affecting the
competitive advantage enjoyed by traditional banks as demand for
Internet banking services increases.
</P>
<P>
A survey of Internet banking by Booz-Allen and Hamilton,
international management consultants, has found that 154 European
banks already have sites on the World Wide Web, with sites
increasing at a rate of nearly 90 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
But use of the sites is growing faster, and almost all the
banks that have an Internet presence plan to upgrade both the size
and capacity of their sites and the level of services they offer.
</P>
<P>
The survey found the cost of an average payment transaction on
the Internet was 13 cents or less. This compares with 26 cents for
a personal computer banking service using the bank's own software,
54 cents for a telephone banking service and l.08 U.S. dollars for
a bank branch.
</P>
<P>
That means costs for Internet banking run at only 15-20 percent
of income, compared with an average cost:income ratio for the
banking industry of about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The cost advantages are just so huge that there would be no
reason not to try it out," said Michael Berger, of Booze-Allen's
financial services team.
</P>
<P>
Booz-Allen said the Internet poses considerable threats to
traditional banks, both because it costs them more to set up Web
services and because it neutralizes many of their competitive
advantages.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it will be easier for customers to pick and choose,
and harder for banks to differentiate their Web sites from their
competitors', including non-banks which can bundle financial
services together on the Internet.

<P>
San Diego, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 2,000 Republican
delegates from across the United States gathered here today to
start a four-day convention to nominate the party's candidate for
the White House.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being held in this Western U.S. coastal city in
California.
</P>
<P>
Bob Dole, who has won most of the Republican presidential
primaries in the past few months, is widely believed to be
formally accepted as the party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Dole flew in to San Diego Sunday from his hometown Russell,
Kansas. Dole and his vice-president running mate Jack Kemp hopped
a harbor ferry to the convention site and were met by a wave of
euphoria.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled to discuss the Republican platform
focusing on the supply-side tax-cut economy.
</P>
<P>
Dole selected Kemp as his running mate late Friday. The choice,
which the former U.S. Senate Majority leader described as the most
important decision in his campaign, has reportedly provided a
dramatic boost to the Republican ticket.

<HEADLINE> London Underground Strike Called Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Train drivers of the London
underground have called off one of their planned strikes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision follows a new offer made by London transport
bosses at talks at conciliation service ACAS last Friday,
indicating an end of a damaging series of 24-hour strikes by the
train drivers' unions ASLEF and RMT.
</P>
<P>
The previous several 24-hour strikes paralyzed London's whole
underground system and brought misery to its l.6 million commuters
and other users.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of industrial action will give the unions time
to ballot members on the deal which they say will lead to a
35-hour week in three years.
</P>
<P>
ASLEF General Secretary Lew Adams said the new offer,
which includes a phased reduction of the working week to 35 hours
from 38.5 over the next three years was "a major achievement for
our trade union and the members we represent."
</P>
<P>
But RMT told its members to reject the offer, saying the price
of a cut in the working week was too high because drivers would
have to accept pay rises below the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
As planned, there will be four more 24-hour strikes on August
23 and 27 and September 5 and 9, but the results of the unions'
vote will be known on August 21.

</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. financial summary released today, as of 31

<HEADLINE> EU Agriculture Reforms to Cost 5,400 Jobs in England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,400 jobs in England
will have to be lost by the end of next year due to the reforms of
the European Union (EU) Common Agricultural Policy, according to
Britain's Rural Development Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a report to be published later today
that the job losses, including ancillary industries such as food
processing, machinery repair and animal food suply, could rise to
as many as 156,000 if these companies fail to adapt to changing
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the need is as strong as ever to introduce
more diversified industries into the countryside in an effort to
safeguard employment.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture experts estimate that by the end of next year the
EU agriculture reforms, introduced in 1992, will have been
directly responsible for a cut in the farm workforce in England by
3.7 percent, a loss of 5,400 full time jobs.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Clark, the commission's director of strategy, was
quoted as saying Sunday, "Farming continues to be a key employer
in many rural areas and together with ancillary industries has a
significant impact on the overall rural economy."
</P>
<P>
"Present problem will be mad cow disease is a reminder of how
vulnerable some rural areas may be to sudden changes in
agricultural conditions," she added.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1992 EU Agriculture Reforms plans, farmers would have
to remove land from production and to curb surpluses of crops and
livestock and in return the EU promised to provide subsidies to
those farmers.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the full-time farm workforce in England
fell by 22 percent from 351,000 to 274,000 jobs between 1980 to
1994.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that the continuing debate over the future
EU Common Agriculture Policy is likely to intensify as the EU
expands to include Central and Eastern European countries.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Calls For Preserving Natural Ecosystem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian Government
today called on the Coastal countries and the island states in
the Western Indian Ocean Region to strive for preventing the
degradation of the coast zone natural ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
The call was delivered to the first experts conference on
Intergrated Coastal Area Management (ICAM) for Eastern Africa and
the Island States, held today at the town of Tanga, about 300
kilometers north of the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian government officials said the livelihood of millions
of people depend on the coastal resources by fishing, trade and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Coastal areas also serve important ecological functions and
represent a reliable tour of biological diversity, they said.
</P>
<P>
"While in some areas there has remained a tremendous
opportunity for greater utilization of this heritage, in others
there is an increasing risk of irreversible damage as a result of
local and instant human activities," said a report made available
to delegates at the conference.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government said it is committed to abide by the
Arusha Maritime Agreement signed in 1993, and emphasized the need
of a regional approach to management of coastal and marine
environment.
</P>
<P>
The workshop attended by 45 experts from nine countries in the
Western Indian Ocean region which will identify approaches for
the implementation of the intergated coast area management.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Makeup of U.S. Leading Economic Indicators being Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Conference Board, a
provider of important U.S. government economic data, is planning
to change the makeup of the leading economic indicators, the first
such change since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based group plans to revamp the 11 economic
measures that make up the indicators by the end of this year,
according to a report of "The Wall Street Journal" today.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board economists are recommending that at least
two present components be dropped from the index: change in
manufacturer's unfilled orders for the durable-goods industries
and change in sensitive-materials prices.
</P>
<P>
They said that these components' predictive powers had been
poor in the economic forecast during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is already broad agreement that a U.S.
Treasury yield-curve component should be added to the index,
according to the minutes of a meeting of the board's advisory
panel held in June.
</P>
<P>
The panel said that the U.S. Treasury yield-curve--the
differences between the interest rates paid on a 10-year note and
on a one-year bill--would most likely track the difference and the
federal fund rate. The board's economist believe the yield-curve
will be an especially promising predictor of recessions and
recoveries.
</P>
<P>
Economists hope the restructuring will improve the forecasting
performance of the leading economic indicators which has done a
reliable work of signaling last six U.S. economic downturns 8 to
18 months in advance, but also sounded some false alarms.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a nonprofit group, took over the index
from the U.S. Commerce Department last December.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Predicts Corn Output up by 18 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Agriculture
Department said today it expects corn output to rise 18 percent
this year, but it seems unlikely to ease price pressures
significantly.
</P>
<P>
The Department also predicted wheat will yield a slight
increase over 1995 production levels, growing about 3 percent to
2.25 billion bushels (a bushel of wheat is equal to 27.24 kgs in
the United States).
</P>
<P>
Based on field conditions in nine Midwestern states, corn
yields are projected to be 118.7 bushels an acre, totaling 8.69
billion bushels nationwide, according to the department report in
its first estimate for the 1996 growing season (One bushel of corn
in the U.S. is equivalent to 25.42 kgs).
</P>
<P>
An agricultural official noted that the current year has been
characterized by high prices and very tight supplies. This
expected production figure is large enough to ease some of that
pressure, but not enough to remove it.
</P>
<P>
The department predicts farmers will receive between 3.15 and
3.55 dollars per bushel of corn, a figure translating into retail
prices 2 percent to 3 percent higher than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report also found that adverse weather conditions in the
spring kept more than 800,000 acres of land out of cultivation.
</P>
<P>
While the 8.69 billion-bushel forecast is 13 percent higher
than 1995 corn levels, however, it remains 14 percent below 1994's
record output of 10.1 billion bushels.
</P>
<P>
Despite the expectation that the 1996 overall wheat crop will
be only slightly higher, the department said spring wheat yields
are projected to be up significantly from 1995's, around 18
percent. The projected spring wheat yield of 635 million bushels
would be the second-highest on record.
</P>
<P>
In other crop news, soybean production is predicted at 2.3
billion bushels, a 7 percent increase over 1995 levels, but
remains 9 percent lower than the 1994 record of 2.56 billion
bushels (one bushel of soybean is about 27.216 kgs in the U.S.).

<HEADLINE> History of Former ANC School to Be Written </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Research workers will
study, gather materials and write the history of a former ANC
school in Tanzania -- the Solomon Mahlangu Freedom College
(SOMAFCO), the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
this was contained in an agreement signed among the Govan
Mbeki Research Resource Center, Fort Hare University and the
Batlagae Trust, said the report.
</P>
<P>
SAMAFCO was founded in 1979 near the Tanzania town of Morogoro
to provide for children of members of the South African African
National Congress (ANC) in exile, as well as young activists
whose education had been disrupted by abrupt departure from South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
A team of researchers would write the history of the school
after gathering oral testimony from ex-students, teachers and
administrators, said team leader Loyiso Pulumani in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the school's archives, held at Port Hare, would
also be used to write SAMAFCO's history.
</P>
<P>
+Because it is part of our educational history, and because
SAMAFCO may be of relevance in the context of current educational
change, I feel that this is an important and exciting project,+ said
Pulumani.

PARIS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Space Agency (ESA)
will end by September 30 the mission of International Ultraviolet
Explorer (IUE) satellite, which has been orbiting in the
ultraviolet since January 1978.
</P>
<P>
Since May 1996, the satellite has been piloted by a single

The IUE, equipped with a telescope of 45 centimeters in diameter
and spectroscopes capable of seeing objects between 115 to 320
nanometers, has sent data on the planet Jupiter and its
satellites, on mechanism associated with star wind in massive
constellation and on the mini-quasar of the Seyfert NGC 7469
galaxy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Mark Thatcher, son of
former British Prime Minister Margret Thatcher, has acquired the
permit of permanent residence in South Africa despite alleged
dishonest business record.
</P>
<P>
The South African government decision was opposed by some
members of parliament who accused him of "unlawfully using the
political influence of his mother" to strike business deals with
foreign companies, Minister of Home Affairs Mangosuthu Buthelezi
said today.
</P>
<P>
However, Buthelezi said Mark had complied with the criteria
for the permit set out in the new Aliens Control Act, which came
into effect on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"He was of good character and would be a desirable inhabitant
of South Africa," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Buthelezi said he welcomed the parliamentarian move
to study Mark's case file "on confidential basis".
</P>
<P>
A total of 16,892 people obtained South African citizenship
between January 1995 and April 1996. Among them, 4,526 people who
were "economically active", had immigrated in 1995, said the
minister.

<HEADLINE> Japan, South Korea Hold Talks On Exclusive Sea Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan and South Korea started
talks here today to try to solve a territorial dispute over a
group of islands which lie within their respective 200-mile (370
kilometers) exclusive economic zones.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have long been at loggerheads over the
ownership of the group of islands known as Tokdo in Korean and
Tekeshima in Japanese, which lie in the Sea of Japan and are
claimed by both.
</P>
<P>
Tensions mounted earlier this year after both sides declared
their 200-mile exclusive zones provided for under the
U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. The law obliges
signatories to respect a 200-mile exclusive economic zone off a
nation's coasts, including those of outlying islands.
</P>
<P>
However, no part of the sea between South Korea and Japan is
wider than 400 nautical miles, making it necessary but difficult
for the two sides to negotiate boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The talks came after an agreement in June when Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto met South Korean President Kim Young-Sam on the
resort island of Cheju.
</P>
<P>
The disputed islands are one several sticking points between
the two countries. In a two-day meeting which ended in Seoul last
Friday, South Korea and Japan failed to reach an accord over a new
fishing region prompted by the UN convention which allows exclusive
maritime economic rights.
</P>
<P>
South Korea insisted that uniform Northeast Asian fishing rules
should be established, while Japan suggested the two countries
should first conclude a new bilateral fishing pact.

<P>
PARIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The 10 African hunger strikers who
were forcibly evacuated from a Paris church on Monday are back and
demanding direct talks with French President Jacques Chirac on the
government's immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
The hunger strikers, all illegal immigrants, were carted off to
hospital by riot police at dawn on Monday after 39 days without
food. But they were back in St Bernard's church in northern Paris
by Monday evening and continued to demand permission to stay in
France.
</P>
<P>
The hunger strikers, who are among 300 illegal immigrants hold
up in the church, say that hard-line Interior Minister Jean-Louis
Debre is no longer worth talking to and the only man they will
speak to is Chirac.
</P>
<P>
They threatened to raise the movement to a national level by
publishing the list of names of all immigrants in France without
residential papers.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 people from organizations sympathetic to the plight of
the illegal immigrants today began a rotating hunger strike to
show their solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The 300 immigrants camped in the church face expulsion under
1993 laws passed by the then Interior Minister Charles
Pasqua. They are demanding the right to stay in France.
</P>
<P>
But the government says it will not give in to their demands
and has ruled out any mass granting of residence papers.

<HEADLINE> US Retail Sales Up 0.1 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in the U.S.
edged up by 0.1 percent in July despite a sharp drop in demand for
automobiles, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that retail sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted 204.7 billion dollars in the month following a revised
decline of 0.5 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Durable goods, those expected to last more than three years,
were down 0.4 percent in July, half the decline of the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
Automobile sales, which account for about one-fourth of retail
trade, declined by 0.6 percent in July, the third decline this
year. But the auto sales were a little bit better than those in
June when they dropped by 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, auto sales in July were up by 4.7 percent from the
same month in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Food stores reported a 0.8 percent surge in sales in July, the
best rate since last December. Sales of gasoline were off 0.6
percent in July. Clothing-store sales dropped 1.6 percent, the
worst showing since March. Sales at drug stores were up 1.1
percent following a 0.1 percent increase in June.
</P>
<P>
Building materials, hardware and garden supplies also dropped
by 1.6 percent after falling 4.1 percent in June, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales represent about one-third of the nation's economic
activity. Many analysts expect that consumer spending will slow in
the second half of the year after surging in the first six months.

TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Iraq today exchanged a
total of 465 remains of soldiers killed during the right-year
Iran-Iraq war as a gesture to normalize relations between the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Persian-language evening daily Ettellat reported that
remains of 65 Iranian soldiers were exchanged with remains of 400
Iraqi soldiers at Iran's southwestern border town of Khosrvi.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on how to continue searches
for more remains of soldiers of the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Iran has not made any official announcement on the number of
Iranians killed or wounded in the war, but unofficial source put
the figure at some 1 million.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities estimated the total human and material cost
of the war to Iran at some 1 trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran has stated last week that it is busy normalizing its
bilateral relations with its former enemy of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Pacific Affairs
Alaeddin Boroujerdi has stressed the settlement of prisoners of
war (POW) problem, saying that Iran can not completely normalize
ties with Iraq as long as the fate of the remaining Iranian POWs
is shrugged in ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
"If the question of the remaining POWs are not resolved
satisfactorily, Iraq's expectation of complete normalization of
relations with Iran would be in vain," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Minister Notes Change in Flow of world's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The world's food supply has
begun to flow from developed countries to developing countries,
which are often the food producers, Indonesian Agriculture
Minister Sjarifudin Baharsjah said.
</P>
<P>
"Food supplies no longer flow from the food-producing countries
to the advanced countries. It is no the other way around," Antara
news agency today quoted Baharsjah as saying here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The pattern has changed because developed countries have begun
producing crops and processed food which they distribute to other
advanced and developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
There is even a tendency for developed nations to make the
developing countries more dependent on them in terms of food
supplies, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that the developing countries should be
cautious, especially because in the past few years, advanced
countries have been showing reluctance in raising their financial
aid to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
Baharsjah said food assistance to developing countries has
gradually declined from 10 billion U.S. dollars in 1982 to 7.2
billion dollars in 1992.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the agricultural sector's contribution to
the national gross income of the developing countries also
declined from 24 percent to 16 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 800 million people in the world who are still
living below the poverty line and are suffering from chronic
malnutrition, mostly from developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we anticipate the condition, some 730 million people in
the world, 300 million of whom are living in the African
Sub-Sahara region, will be living in starvation by the year 2010,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the world food summit to be held in Rome from November 13 to
17, Baharsjah denied that the summit will form a new international
institution.
</P>
<P>
The summit will renew the world leaders' commitment to
eradicate poverty, malnutrition and starvation as well as to
improve world self-sufficiency in food, he explained.

<HEADLINE> Two Million Foreign Tourists Visit Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Nearly two million foreign
tourists visited Indonesia during the first half of this year,
representing an increase of 17.6 percent over the 1.7 million who
arrived during the same period in 1995, a senior official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications Joop Ave said
that tourism industry earned 2.4 billion US dollars from January
to June, up from the 2 billion US dollars earned over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Tourism Director General Andi Mappisammeng said
between 4.8 million and 5 million foreign tourists are expected to
visit Indonesia in 1996 compared to the 4.3 million target set for
1995.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government predicted that the tourism industry
will be the country's largest foreign exchange earner by the end
of the sixth five year development plan period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 4.32 million foreign tourists visited Indonesia,
spending 5.22 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
About 6.5 million foreign tourists are expected to visit the
country in 1998, spending more than 8.9 billion US dollars. That
will make tourism the number one foreign exchange earner,
replacing the oil and gas sector, official sources said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise 0.3 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices index (CPI)
in the U.S. rose by 0.3 percent in July after advancing 0.1
percent in June, the U.S. Commerce department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rising of consumer prices in the country resulted from the
increase of food and housing prices although the energy prices was
down continuously.
</P>
<P>
With fresh vegetable prices soaring by 2.1 percent, food prices
shot up 0.5 percent in July, a bit slower than the 0.7 percent
jump a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Housing costs were up 0.4 percent, partly due to increases of
1.5 percent for residential electricity and 0.4 percent for
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Overall, energy prices fell by 0.4 percent, including a 2.7
percent drop for gasoline, which had shot up 18.2 percent from
last November through May.
</P>
<P>
For the first seven months of 1996, the U.S. CPI rose at a 3.5
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate, much faster than the 2.5
percent advance for all of 1995, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Much of the increase since January was attributed to temporary
jumps in energy and food costs last winter and spring. Excluding
those two volatile components, the so-called core rate of
inflation was up 0.3 percent in July and an annualized 3 percent
for the year so far.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department also reported last week that
prices for finished wholesale goods in July were unchanged and
found little inflation pressures in the pipeline from costs of
unfinished goods and crude materials.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the new report on consumer prices was not
likely in itself to persuade the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to
raise short-term interest rates to keep the economy from
accelerating and driving prices higher.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said in its recent survey that it found anecdotal
evidence that inflation remains subdued and the economy was
slowing down on its own.

</P>
<P>
The Afghan government was keen to establish friendly and
brotherly relations with Pakistan and to coordinate policies in
evolving a joint approach on various issues in international fora,
Qanooni added.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of reopening the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul,
Qanooni said that this would be a key factor in furthering the
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Aseff Ali said that soon a delegation would be sent to Kabul to
prepare grounds for the reopening of the Pakistan mission in
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister reiterated Pakistan's readiness in keeping
with the Afghan request to facilitate the transportation through
Pakistan of the items the Afghan government decided to import from
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
To meet the immediate requirements of the people in Kabul, the
Pakistani government has agreed the provision of their
requirements from the local market.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests to UN over Death of Demonstrator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has
protested to the U.N. over the killing of a Greek Cypriot who took
part in Sunday's anti-Turkish demonstration in the U.N.-controlled
buffer zone, the Cyprus News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides Monday summoned the
ambassadors of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council and the U.N. resident representative here to protest the
killing.
</P>
<P>
Tassos Isaac, 24, from Paralimni village on the eastern coast,
was killed by a Turkish mob after he, along with hundreds of
motorcyclists, crossed by force into the buffer zone which divides
the island into Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Cyprus permanent representative to the
U.N. was also instructed to lodge a protest.
</P>
<P>
Several others were injured during the clash between the
motorcyclist demonstrators and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials in Cyprus said that the 12,000-strong
U.N. peace-keeping force had done their best to avoid incident, but
they felt in short of strength.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops took
control of the northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Since then the U.N. peace-keeping force has been patrolling
along the 180-kilometer buffer zone.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Republicans opened their 36th annual national convention in
San Diego, a meticulously choreographed pageant of unity that
evoked the glories of their party's past. A softened Republican
platform was officially presented to and adopted by the
convention.
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey signed a 23 million dollar agreement to buy natural
gas from Iran, raising the possibility of the United States
imposing sanctions under a new law opposed by America's European
allies.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian national security chief Alexander Lebed made a
daring midnight run into the heart of war-torn Chechnya Monday in
a bid to negotiate what Russian troops apparently cannot achieve
by force: the withdrawal of Chechen separatist guerrillas from the
shell-shattered regional capital.
</P>
<P>
-- International peacekeepers in Bosnia, including thousands of
U.S. troops, have been on a heightened state of alert since late
last week due to an unspecified threat of attack against them,
U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Netanyahu said Israel's interim peace accord with
Palestinians does not bar construction of Jewish settlements on
occupied land. Separately, Israeli police laid plans to expel some
of 100,000 illegal workers, many from Romania, Thailand and Ghana,
who were a source of cheap labor when Palestinian areas were
sealed off in recent years.

NEW DELHI, August 13 (Xinhua ) -- India has floated a global
tender to speed up a massive dredging operation at Calcutta,
Cochin, Bombay and Goa ports to improve navigation facilities
there in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Although the dredging corporation of India (DCI) had already

position and the total dredging requirement, said Chairman of the

In order to expedite the process, the government had decided to
float a global tender to undertake the dredging operation in a
massive way to increase the navigation facilities in those ports,
he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11 internationally-renowned firms had already
responded to the tender, of which eight had been short listed
after considering the prequalification verifications, he said.

<P>
TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran has launched a special
program to study causes of pollution in the Gulf water, a press
report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The program is been carried out jointly by Iran's National
Oceanographic Center, the Chemical Engineering Research Center,
the Genetic Research Center and the Institute of Oil Industry
Studies.
</P>

The Persian daily "Abrar" reported that the aim of the program
is to clean up the vital waterway which was polluted due to
the Gulf crisis triggered by the Iraqi-invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Eventually the pollution could date back to the 1980-1988
Iran-Iraq war when the two warring sides attacked oil tankers.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the plan said that the goal is to
study and determine the consequences of pollution from oil and
other inorganic sources to the marine life in the strategic
waterway.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no detail about how many people
are involved, which area they are working and how long it

<HEADLINE> Seven Executed For Murdering Taxi Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Seven people in China were
executed today for robbery and for murdering taxi drivers.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dongzhi and Zhu Chunmen from Tongchuan City of Shaanxi
Province, both had served prison terms before, and Liu Jian and Li
Yong, vagrants from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, were
sentenced to death by the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Three others found guilty of murder who were executed today
were Bao Yonghong, a farmer in Guide County, Qinghai Province, and
Chen Min and Chen Lemin, also farmers from Yongcheng County of
Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
According to the Supreme People's Court, Zhang and Zhu shot
three taxi drivers and two farmers and robbed the drivers of four
different automobiles of more than 740,000 yuan, in Gansu, Henan,
and Shanxi from August, 1993, to March, 1995.
</P>
<P>
They also stole nine jeeps and other cars, TV sets, and gold

hammer, then dumped his body by the roadside.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of China's economy, its taxi
business has also expanded rapidly, not only in urban areas but in
rural ones as well, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
But, he was quick to point out, the number of cases of people
robbing and murdering taxi drivers has also been on the rise in
some places. He urged the people's courts to deal harshly with
those who are guilty of these crimes.

<HEADLINE> Bougainville Operation Not A Failure: PNG Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CABERRA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Papua New Guinea
Defense Force (PNGDF) today denied that the latest offensive
against Bougainville independence fighters had been a failure.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier General Jerry Singirok also confirmed the PNGDF
soldiers who had been stationed on Bougainville for more than 14
months were sent back to Wewak on PNG's northern coast, a news
story by the Australian Associated Press from Port Moresby said.
</P>
<P>
Singirok said the operation could not be seen as a success or
failure, "the number of soldiers dead or the number of rebels
killed, it's not a victory on either side".
</P>
<P>
"It is a loss of Papua New Guinean lives, I as the commander
cannot tell you whether we are successful or have been defeated".
</P>
<P>
He said he made the decision to withdraw the troops because the
second battalion had been stationed on the island too long and the
operation could not be maintained.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, logistically, we were not able to sustain a major
military operation and I did not want unnecessary loss of lives,
so I had called off the operation".
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, about 200 troops and police,
along with a similar number of Bougainville Revolutionary Army
(BRA) soldiers have been killed during the military operation in
the island where there is a population of 170,000.
</P>
<P>
The latest military operation -- High Speed II -- was launched
14 months ago and ended on July 15.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 800 PNGDF troops will remain
stationed on Bougainville.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Syrian Guerrillas Attack Israeli Forces in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's pro-Syrian Amal
Movement announced that its guerrillas launched bomb attacks at
Israeli forces in the so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon
this morning, wounding several Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in the capital, the Shiite Amal
Movement, or Movement of Hope, said that one group of its
fighters detonated a bomb at 8:55 a.m. (05:55 GMT) targeting an
Israeli foot patrol on the road near Dabl village in Bint Jbail.
</P>
<P>
Four Israeli soldiers were wounded by the blast, said the
organization led by House Speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
It added that the guerrillas detonated another bomb at 9:50
a.m (06:50 GMT) when reinforcing Israeli troops rushed to the
scene, causing more Israeli soldiers wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces, on the other hand, bombarded
this afternoon a half dozen of south Lebanese villages on the
hills opposite the border strip.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in the area reported that the bombardment was
accompanied by intensive machine-gun fires at Iglim Al-Toffah, or
Province of Apple, a mountain area often used by Moslem guerrillas
as a springboard for launching attacks.
</P>
<P>
Several artillery shells fell in an area controlled by the
Finnish contingent of the U.N. peace-keeping forces in south
Lebanon without causing casualties or serious damages, the
police sources added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced that they
killed a militia man of the Israeli client South Lebanon Army this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, said
in a statement that the guerrillas fired machine-guns and
rocket-propelled grenades at the militia man who was driving a car
on the road between the villages of Alman and Deir Seryan in
Marjayoun.
</P>
<P>
Another group of guerrillas bombarded the Israeli position at
Alman with "suitable weapons," and caused damages, the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen Israeli soldiers have died in south Lebanon since the
beginning of this year, including 10 killed after Israel's
Operation Grapes of Wrath in Lebanon in April.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao Entrepreneurs Expect High-Tech Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Macao entrepreneurs have poised to
expand local industry with high-tech sector through cooperation
with other parts of the world, especially, China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
They say that industrial production, whose value has amounted
to over 22 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Macao,
must be expanded in Macao through the establishment of high-tech
and new technology enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eric T. M. Yeung, chairman of the Macao Productivity and
Technology Transfer Center, told Xinhua in an interview that it is
the high time for Macao to upgrade its industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
"Industry has played an increasingly important role in the
overall economy of Macao, which is known as 'Oriental Monte Carlo'
for a long time," he said. "More than 50,000 people are engaged
in industrial production, and that was 25 percent of all the
employed."
</P>
<P>
However, Macao's traditional industrial sector, such as
toy-making and textile industry, is being challenged by
ever-stronger competitors in neighboring regions, and may
gradually die out if not upgraded promptly.
</P>
<P>
"Macao should have high-tech and highly valued-added industry
to survive in the cut-throat competition," said the entrepreneur,
adding it is also of vital importance to the related industries
such as finance, insurance, transportation, real estate and
tourism in a small area like Macao.
</P>
<P>
Yeung has been one of the pioneers in promoting high-tech
industry in Macao. Over the past several years, he has established
or co-established a high-tech toy-making factory and an optical
and electrical appliances company in Macao, whose products have
earned big money for him.
</P>
<P>
Currently, many local industrialists have realized the
importance of technical upgrading. Several new high-tech or high
value-added companies have gone into operation now.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Macao has started cooperation with several
scientific institutions and companies from the inland areas. They
include Qinghua University and Zhejiang University. Joint research
organs were founded in Macao to provide technical service.
</P>
<P>
Yeung said that it is the best time to expand high-tech and
other highly value-added industries in Macao now following the
opening of the Macao international airport, which made Macao
become an important place overnight and its potential advantages
visible.
</P>
<P>
The Macao government has made preferential policies for
overseas investors, and has offered help for the establishment of
the Macao Productivity and Technology Transfer Center, which is
aimed at promotion of the use of new technology and training of
workers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Macao's lower tax rate and tariffs, cheaper land
price and convenient transportation are also attractions to
investors, said Yeung.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Arrests Suspected Killers of PM's Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Three suspected killers of
Bangladesh's first prime minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were
arrested early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Mujibur, who is also father of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina,
was assassinated in a military coup in August 1975. The case has
been barred to be tried by the indemnity bill which inserted in
the constitution since the regime of Ziaur Rahman, who is also the
late husband of ex-prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
Due to the indemnity bill, at least eight of the suspected
killers were posted in Bangladeshi missions abroad after Zia came
to power in November 1975.
</P>
<P>
Police sources confirmed that the three former army officers,
retired army colonel Farooq Reehman, ex-colonel Shahriar Rashid
khan and retired major Mohammad Khairuzzaman, were arrested under
the nation's special powers act which allows any suspect to be
detained for one month without being formally charged.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina took power on June 23 after her Awami league
defeated Khaleda Zia's ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) in the June 12 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The arrested will face trial for murder, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Milestone in China's Development of Geosciences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The 30th International
Geological Congress will be an important milestone in the
country's geosciences development, according to members of the
organizing committee at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The congress's major topic was continental geology, a field in
which Chinese geologists have done extensive research, the results
of which they were able to make known to the world, especially
about the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Only six Chinese delegates attended the 25th IGC in 1976. Nine
were at the 26th IGC, but the number of Chinese delegates jumped
to 300 by the 29th IGC, and was up to 3,485 this time.
</P>
<P>
The event will help the many Chinese geologists keep up with
technology and geoscience theories in the rest of the world, with
the exchanges with foreign scientists.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng delivered
speeches during the congress, which will close tomorrow, and
which has attracted over 6,000 geologists from around the world
and will have a far-reaching impact on China's geoscience.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for one of the congresses to be held
in China, the third time in Asia, and the fifth time in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
William S. Fyfe, former president of the International Union
of Geological Science (IUGS), said that the 30th IGC has been the
best-organized among all past international geological
congresses.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Office Rental Market to Be on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong office rental
market is poised for an upturn, according to a recent analysis
report issued by Salomon Brothers, one of the world's leading
investment banks with Asian-Pacific Headquarters in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Michael Green, Salomon Brothers' director and property
analyst, said that the Grade A office rental market in the
territory appears to be at the bottom of its cycle and that office
rentals are expected to increase during 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's latest GDP estimates support office rental
market fundamentals, as does the recent services export growth of
14.4 percent in real terms and services import growth of 7.6
percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
He said the Grade A office rental is expected to increase about
10 percent in 1996, and 15 to 17 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report said the residential market is likely to slow down
in the short term despite the fact that new loan money for
residential mortgages at the beginning of July reached 11 to 14
billion HK dollars (1.42 to 1.8 billion US dollars), which was the
highest level of finance available on record for the last three
and half years.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders to Persuade MNLF to Withdraw from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today ordered Defense Secretary Renato de Villa to work for the
peaceful pullout of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
rebels from four towns in Zamboanga Del Sur province.
</P>
<P>
Ramos issued the directive after he was informed that some 300
armed MNLF rebels forcibly landed and are still staying in the
four towns over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He asked the defense secretary to closely coordinate and work
with the joint ceasefire committee for the peaceful withdrawal of
the MNLF guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, MNLF chief Nur Misuari, who began his campaign
to run for the governor of the autonomous region in Muslim
Mindanao on Monday, told a group of senators in Cotabato city that
he could not guarantee that MNLF members would surrender their
arms to the government.
</P>
<P>
The senators led by Senator Ernesto Maceda are conducting
public hearings on the establishment of the proposed southern
Philippines council for peace and development which has drawn
fierce opposition from Christians in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Misuari told them that the word "surrender" is a taboo for the
MNLF and it is "the highest form of indignity for us". He asked
the Philippine government to give the MNLF more time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tension gripped a commercial area today in the city
as bomb experts were called in to defuse a suspected bomb left by
a male customer in the restaurant where Misuari was staying.
</P>
<P>
According to local press, soldiers and policemen guarding
Misuari tightened their security when bomb experts tinkered on the
"bomb" which later turned to be a canister containing coins.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Commanders Gather for Seminar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's commanders of logistics
units have gathered here this week for a seminar amid fears that
American forces in the Gulf might launch an attack on targets in
the islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
The state-run "Tehran Radio" reported today the four-day
seminar began on Monday with the commanders pledging to defend
their country.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Dadvin, commander of the ground forces, said at the
seminar that his forces were on the "highest alert" and ready to
counter possible U.S. attack.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no more details.
</P>
<P>
Iran's hardline Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri on
Monday called on the armed forces to maintain vigil to confront
"any conspiracy of the United States."
</P>
<P>
Addressing armed forces in Iran's northwestern city of Tabriz,
he said, as long as the Islamic Revolution exists, "plots and
hostilities of enemies towards the Iranian nation will continue."
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Rezaee, Commander of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corp
(IRGC), warned last week that his forces would deal a severe blow
to the Americans if Iran is attacked.
</P>
<P>
He said:"the United States of America should realize that the
Persian Gulf waterway should be safe and secure for all peoples
in the region."
</P>
<P>
"If such safety and security are impaired, those involved in
such designs will be the real losers and receive the severest
blow," he added.
</P>
<P>
General Rezaee underlined that Iran would defend all its
reconstructed areas, its sea and air gates, its airspace and land
entries with all its power.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Persian Gulf is rather tense since both
the American and Iranian forces are on the alert for any possible
military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Iran lodged a protest against U.S. fighter
planes' violation of its airspace, particularly in Bushehr where
Iran is building a nuclear power plant with Russian help.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities said that American fighter planes
violated Iran's airspace for three times in a single day on
August 3.

<HEADLINE> Westerners' Misunderstanding From Poor Knowledge Of Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A well-known Sinologist said
here Monday that the language barrier still remains one of the
biggest factors in the West's failure to understand China.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Kupfer, who is vice-chairman of the International
Society for Chinese Teaching, said that very few experts are
learning and studying Chinese language and culture in the West,
and this is one reason why the governments and people of western
countries have quite limited knowledge about China, and even hold
one-sided and impractical views of the country.
</P>
<P>
The professor made the remarks at the Fifth International
Symposium on Teaching Chinese as A Foreign Language, which ended
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for westerners to acquire the all-round and
objective information and understanding about China, if they lack
the ability of exchanging views directly with Chinese people, or
cannot understand Chinese television news and read newspapers or
other written documents."
</P>
<P>
Chinese language is the key to opening the door to Chinese
culture, he said, noting, however, that only a very few westerners
have the tool.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is detrimental to the Sino-foreign exchanges and
even to the world peace. How can we ignore China whose population
is one-fifth of that of the world?" he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that owing to a lack of knowledge of Chinese
history and culture, some westerners are baffled by why China is
promoting patriotism, and creating a new "Chinese threat".
</P>
<P>
Because this will be harmful to the course of peace in the next
century, he said, the importance of Chinese language should be
stressed worldwide, and various means should be adopted to
introduce the language.
</P>
<P>
Joel Bellassen, a professor from Paris, said that previously
many westerners studied China because it is a mysterious and
strange nation.
</P>
<P>
"I had frequently called for the importance of Chinese
language, but few people agreed with me. Now, the importance of
China has become a fact. More westerners have come to study
Chinese with a sincere manner, this is a good phenomenon," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Unit Trust Net Sales Hit Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The unit trust industry
attracted record high net inflows of 332.3 million US dollars in
the first half of this year, according to the Hong Kong Investment
Funds Association (HKIFA).
</P>
<P>
The last time when the first-half-year figure exceeded 300
million US dollars was in 1993 when the industry registered net
inflows of 301.6 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Aggregate gross sales for January to June 1996 reached 2.2
billion US dollars, up 37.8 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Net sales soared more substantially to 332.3 million US
dollars, increasing 35.1 times that of the 1995 first half's net
figure.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Lo, chairman of HKIFA, said that year-to-date aggregate
net sales would have been higher had it not been for the heavy
outflows in June, which amounted to 152.5 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is also the first time since last June that the
industry recorded net outflows, adding that the level of outflows
even exceeded that of March 1994 when US interest rates started
to move in an upward trend.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the net outflows in June, the sales trend in 1996 has
in general been positive," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All of the months registered gross sales of over 300 million
US dollars, which happened three times or less in each of the last
two years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Investment Funds Association consists of 45 fund
management companies as full members and 34 professional first as
associate members.

<HEADLINE> Draft Construction Law, Air Defence Law Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The draft Construction Law and
the draft Civil Air Defence Law were adopted in principle at a
meeting of the State Council, China's highest governing body,
today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meeting described the construction industry
as a "pillar" for China's economy.
</P>
<P>
The scale of urban construction, village and town construction
and apartment construction across China has been growing steadily
with the growth of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that it is necessary to formulate the Construction
Law in order to improve supervision and management of
construction activity, maintain the order of the construction
market, ensure the quality and safety of construction projects and
protect legitimate rights and interests of those involved in the
construction.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed the view that over the past four decades
the government and people have spent enormous amounts of funds,
manpower and materials on civil air defence construction.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to formulate the Civil Air Defence Law to guide
and standardize the civil air defence practices, summarize China's
experience in air defence construction, draw on foreign experience
in this regard, effectively organize air defence, protect people's
lives and property safety, and ensure the smooth progress of the
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Participants decided that After revisions, the two draft laws
will be submitted by the State Council to the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress for deliberation.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Can MNLF Persuade Other Moro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- With the signing of the final
peace agreement between the government and the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) fixed at the end of the month, it seems
certain that peace will finally have a chance in Mindanao. But how
to persuade the other rebelling Moro groups which vowed to seek
Muslim autonomy in the southern Philippines to join peace talks
with the government remains a challenge.
</P>
<P>
MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari was repeatedly saying recently that
he is ready to mediate between the government and the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) and the Abu Sayyaf, two other main Moro
insurgent groups in the south, as soon as the final peace pact is
signed between the government and the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
At their secret meeting at the MNLF headquarters in Sulu
province last Friday, Misuari repeated his promise once again to
Senator Francisco Tatad.
</P>
<P>
"My expectation is once there is peace, then it is possible to
work out some kind of solution with some of their leaders. We are
able to exert some moral pressure on them because of the peace
process", Misuari said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he warned that the MNLF was determined to
have this peace pact and would protect it in any possible ways. He
called on the MILF and the Abu Sayyaf to cooperate and follow his
suit.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said a question mark should be hung onto Misuari's
promise, because four of the five remaining Moro groups have
voiced their opposition to the peace pact forged between the
government and the MNLF. these groups are the MILF, the Abu
Sayyaf, the Bangsa Moro Islamic party and the United Moro
Organization.
</P>
<P>
What is more important is the fact that the military strength
of the MILF is growing after some 2,000 MNLF members defected to
it and the Abu Sayyaf has begun to cooperate with the MILF in
training their fighters in preparation of future armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
According to local report, the MILF caucus has decided to
reject the proposed southern Philippines council for peace and
development (SPCPD) as a formula to end Muslim revolt in Mindanao
since it does not address all fundamental issues of the Moro
people in the area.
</P>
<P>
"After a long and thorough discussion and analysis of the peace
formula, the MILF are not convinced that the establishment of the
SPCPD is the lasting and just solution to the problems in
Mindanao," MILF head Hashim Salamat said.
</P>
<P>
He also hinted that the MILF is inclined to abandon the Tripoli
agreement forged between the MNLF and the former Marcos government
in 1976, because the government has never been implementing it in
the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the SPCPD is not a part of the Tripoli
agreement, it is just the continuation of divide-and-rule policy
of the government, Salamat said. he added that the strident
opposition to it by many sectors in Mindanao, especially the
Christians, clearly indicated that the peace formula will not
work.
</P>
<P>
Some politicians here warned that the installation of the SPCPD
might even cause a new war in Mindanao, as the MILF has vowed to
pursue the struggle for "genuine Muslim autonomy" in the area. The
MILF did not explain how it will continue its armed struggle, but
it said it will "put up a war" if the MNLF runs after it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the MILF also announced that the MNLF can no longer
represent the Muslims in Mindanao after some 2,000 MNLF fighters
defected to the MILF due to their dissatisfaction over Misuari's
peace agreement with the government.
</P>
<P>
"Now the MILF is the legitimate representative of the Muslims
fighting for genuine autonomy in Mindanao," said MILF vice
chairman for military affairs Ghadzali Jaafar.
</P>
<P>
This announcement has forced the government to begin
considering the MILF as a more potent threat than the MNLF. With
three-fourths of its 20,000 members are armed fighters, the MILF
is becoming stronger than the MNLF which has 23,000 members after
the alleged defection.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf also voiced their boycott against Misuari. It
even began to set up a joint training program with the MILF in
Cotabato city. Although it has only 200 men, they have very
sophisticated weapons and are really a headache to the government
forces which are pursuing them.
</P>
<P>
The United Moro National Organization branded Misuari's
candidacy under the ruling Lakas-National Union for governor of
the autonomous region of Muslim Mindanao as "a monumental betrayal
of the Moro cause" and "a mockery by the Ramos administration of
the 200,000 innocent Moro deaths".
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that in face of so much opposition, it is not an
easy job for Misuari to persuade the other Moro groups to join
peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
But Misuari himself remains optimistic. According to him, the
MILF has already split into two factions. Although the faction of
Hashim Salamat seemed bent on pursuing independence, the faction
of Haji Murad supports the peace agreement so long as it was
consistent with the provisions of the Tripoli agreement.
</P>
<P>
Now nothing can stop the signing of the final peace agreement,
he said, adding the setting up of the SPCPD is the only step at
the moment that would ensure peace for both Muslims and Christians
in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"With the MNLF's willingness to sign the final pact on August
28 during the fourth round of formal talks in Jakarta, the specter
of war has been erased in the country", Misuari said.
</P>
<P>
The Ramos administration also announced that it supports
Misuari's effort and plans to hold separate talks with the MILF
next year since the Moro group totally rejected the peace deal
between the government and the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
"We are open to exploring all possible avenues and approaches
to bring everybody in the fold of law", Defense Secretary Renato
de Villa said a couple of days ago.
</P>
<P>
The governor of the autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao even
appealed to the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) to use
its influence to help Misuari unite the Moro groups in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
But it seems that neither the government nor the rising
political star can bring other Moro groups to the negotiation
table soon, analysts predicted.

<HEADLINE> China's Satellite Earthquake Prediction System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Instead of using traditional
methods of earthquake prediction, some Chinese scientists are
looking heavenward rather than at the earth to deal with this
perennial headache.
</P>
<P>
Geologists believe that the present techniques and equipment
are not suitable for predictions. Qiang Zuji, a research fellow
with the Institute of Geology of the State Seismological Bureau
and his colleagues have been making short-term predictions by
applying meteorological satellite data to their research over the
past six years.
</P>
<P>
In one of the country's major scientific and technological
research projects during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period
(1991-1995), the State Seismological Bureau and the Satellite
Center of the State Meteorological Bureau combined efforts in
analysing earth surface temperature data collected by a
meteorological satellite, and looked for infrared anomalies, which
are believed to be related to earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
According to Qiang, over the past six years they made 50
short-term predictions to the State Seismological Bureau, and
while only 12 were accurate in terms of time, place, and magnitude
of the quake. They made reports on the two earthquakes in inland
areas that measured seven on the Richter Scale. One was in Yunnan
last February and another in Qinghai in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan prediction was made on December 16, 1995 for an
earthquake measuring 6.9 to take place north of Kunming, the
capital of Yunnan Province. On February 3, 1996, a quake measuring
seven on the Richter Scale jolted Lijiang, only 100 kilometers
from the predicted quake area.
</P>
<P>
Increases in temperature in relation to quakes have long been
of interest to scientists. According to records in over a dozen
quake-stricken areas, temperatures were two to eight degrees
higher at the quake sites than in surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Qiang, who got his master's degree in the late 1950s in the
Soviet Union and had been studying earthquakes for decades, began
to apply satellite remote sensing technology to quake prediction
in 1989. He came to believe that before the earthquake hit, rock
formations are under great pressure, and slits may appear around
the quake center area, with gases such as carbon dioxide,
nitrogen, and methane being released from the slits.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is a release of thermal energy that
produces thermal infrared anomalies.
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon can be recorded with high-resolution satellite
technology and fed into a large computer system to combine it with
research on geological structures, the distribution of quake
belts, and other meteorological data.
</P>
<P>
He attributed past errors to cloudy weather and the limited
ability of his equipment, which prevented the spotting of thermal
flows.
</P>
<P>
Qiang said that China will soon launch a group of small
meteorological satellites which will be equipped with special
technology for detecting thermal flows on cloudy and overcast days.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guomin, deputy head of the Quake Analysis and Prediction
Center at the State Seismological Bureau, said that the satellite
remoting sensing for quake prediction will be an important way for
future quake prediction, but that it still needs further work to
prove its success rate.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Condemns New Settlement Activity in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat today accused the decision of the Israeli
government to transfer hundreds of caravans to Jewish settlements
in the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said in Gaza that the move is a flagrant violation of
the peace agreement between Israel and the PLO.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli peace activist organization, Peace Now, held a
demonstration outside the Knesset (parliament) this morning
against the government decision.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting Monday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Modechai
announced to ease procedures for settlers to obtain building
permits in Judea, Samaria (Israel's terms for the West Bank) and
the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
As a concrete measure, he granted permission for nearly 300
trailers to be set up at schools and public institutions in the
settlements in time for the new school year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 115 trailers will be erected at schools and another
100 will be set up at Shomron College in Ariel. The defense
minister also gave approval for another 83 to be set up at public
institutions in West Bank settlements.
</P>
<P>
The move is in accordance with the rightwing Likud
government's decision on August 2 to lift the freeze on building
in the existing settlements. Under that decision, Modechai is
responsible for approving building permits.
</P>
<P>
In their reaction to the decision by the Israeli government
Monday to resume Israeli-Palestinian peace talks at the committee
level, PA officials said it is in no way indicating Israel's
desire to conduct peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jamil Tarifi, who is to meet with Maj.-Gen. Oren Shahor to
discuss civilian matters Wednesday, noted that he doubts the
Israeli sincerity, saying that the renewal of the talks will
perhaps only serve public consumption.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Prime Minister, now opposition leader, Shimon
Peres warned that en expansion of Jewish settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip would destroy chances of peace.

<HEADLINE> Pre-Birth Problems Doom Children To Low IQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- An unhappy pregnant mom could
produce a baby with a low IQ, a group of Chinese scientists have
warned.
</P>
<P>
Anything upsetting a pregnant woman may lead to excessive
secretion of catecholamine, a kind of hormone, in her body, which
can do harm to the nerve system of the fetus, and finally affect
the child's intelligence quotient (IQ), the researchers at the
Wuhan Tongji Medical Science University said.
</P>
<P>
They also cited a mixture of potential problems that all point
to low intelligence in some newly-borns.
</P>
<P>
Close blood-relatives who have children, the life-threatening
pregnancy illness, toxaemia and smoking during pregnancy can all
affect the IQ of their offspring after they are born.
</P>
<P>
"We find children of parents who are close blood relatives
running three-fold risks of low IQ compared with those in a
control (normal) group," said Prof. Shi Shuhua, the head of the
research group.
</P>
<P>
Toxaemia in pregnancy may cause short supplies of blood to the
fetus, risking harm to the developing baby's nervous system.
</P>
<P>
Smoking during pregnancy, which has been widely known for its
harmful impact on babies, was found to interfere with the supply
of oxygen to the placenta, which in turn caused problems to the
baby's nerve system, Shi noted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show about one in every 100 Chinese children suffers
from low intelligence.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- North China coastal city Tianjin
has 1.16 million old people, an increase of almost 25 percent
compared five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The number of over 60s is increasing annually at a rate of 5.27
percent, 3.8 times over the average rate of the total population
of nearly 10 million in the city, which is directly under the
jurisdiction of the central government.
</P>
<P>
Among the elderly, 766,200 are aged 65 or above, making up 66
per cent of the total. Those who are aged between 70 and 79 number
340,000, constituting 29 percent of the total, according to a
local media report.
</P>
<P>
There are 100,000 aged 80 or above, accounting for 8.61 percent
of the total, and there are 60 people who have already reached
their 100th birthdays, 2.22 times over that five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 70 percent of the elderly population
are living in downtown areas in the city, and the ratio is on the
rise.
</P>
<P>
Experts say this large ratio of old people has served to
increase the burdens on their families and on society.
</P>
<P>
China is now the largest aging society in the world, with 110
million people who are aged 60 or above.

BANGKOK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Laos has prohibited its laborers
from working aboard to prevent domestic labor shortage in the
future, the Thai news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ban was made following the Thai government's decision to
allow immigrants from neighboring countries to work in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Influx of Myanmar, Cambodian and Laotian workers are expected
in Thailand as they were attracted by the wages which are much
higher than those in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
The Thai news agency quoted a source in the official job
placement agency in the northern province of Chiang Mai as saying
that Laos, with a population of only 4.5 million, needs workers,
especially skilled manpower for the country's development.

<HEADLINE> Research Institute Calls for More Fixed-Asset Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China should intensify its
investment in fixed assets in the coming five months, with the
focus on infrastructure and renovation projects, a report by the
Institute of Banking and Finance under the People's Bank of China
has suggested.
</P>
<P>
The move will help mitigate the impact of a foreign trade
deficit during the January-June period, and thereby guarantee a
steady increase in the national economy, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Consumption, investment and a trade surplus have combined to
contribute heavily to China's dynamic economic growth in the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
"However, the overall picture has changed due to sliding
exports in the previous months," the report said, suggesting that
the declining role of exports in economic development be made up
by more fixed-asset investment.
</P>
<P>
"Massive inventories also oblige us to increase investment in
fixed assets, rather than continue to pump money into production,"
the report explained.
</P>
<P>
The report called for greater efforts to improve the investment
mix, saying that it is desirable to maintain the year-round
investment growth rate for basic constructions at a minimum of 19
percent, which is the average level for the years since the late
1970s.
</P>
<P>
Investment growth rate in renovation projects, the reports
said, should not be lower than 20.4 percent, an annual rate since
the launching of China's reform and opening drive.
</P>
<P>
Money put in infrastructure and renovation projects during the
January-May period this year grew 10.2 and 6.7 percent,
respectively, compared to 16.5 percent for fixed assets and 32.5
percent for the real estate sector.

As a member of the group, Jamyang participated in the search.
</P>
<P>
He said that he and other group members acted strictly in
accordance with religious rituals and the historical convention.
</P>
<P>
Group members went through such procedures as watching a holy
lake to make the choice for the soul boy, setting out in search of
the soul boy, asking candidates for the soul boy to identify
articles left by the tenth Panchen Lama, reciting all kinds of
Buddhist scriptures and submitting the list of candidates for the
soul boy to the State Council for approval.
</P>
<P>
Later, the central government sent leading officials to preside
over the ceremony in which lots were drawn from a gold urn to
decide on the soul boy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Then a report on the soul boy thus decided was submitted to
the State Council for approval, he said.
</P>
<P>
Presided over by leading officials sent by the central
government, an enthronement ceremony was held for the new Panchen
Lama, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our search and verification work was done in a serious and
fair manner, to the warm support of Tibetan monks, nuns and
laymen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jamyang, who is also president of the Gansu Provincial Buddhism
Association, said, "The Dalai Lama has betrayed his motherland and
is in exile. So, he has no right to become involved in this grand
affair of Buddhism."
</P>
<P>
He denounced the Dalai Lama for illegally designating a boy as
the "real soul boy for the Panchen Lama."

<HEADLINE> Scientists Concern Excessive Water Extraction and Pollution  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 50,000 people in the
world die every day from diseases caused by water pollution, a
major conference in Beijing was told today.
</P>
<P>
Humans are expected to fight for water in the 21st century when
half of the underground water becomes contaminated, Chinese and
foreign geologists concluded at a workshop session on underground
water management held in the Chinese capital today.
</P>
<P>
Water shortages are already affecting 80 countries with 40
percent of the world total population, said Michael Knight,
director of the National Center for Groundwater Management of
Australia and elected chairman of the International Association of
Hydrogeologists.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that almost all large cities in the world will be
confronted with water crisises by 21st century.
</P>
<P>
To date, global extraction of underground water comes to 550
billion cubic meters, 85 percent of which is used by the United
States, India, China, Pakistan, the European Community, the
Commonwealth of Independent States, Iran, Mexico, Japan and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades, water supplies in Asia have shown a
steady decline and the per capita share of water resources has
reduced by 40 to 60 percent, said an Iranian expert.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many countries have extracted large amounts of
underground water, which turned huge tracts of farmland into
saline-alkali soil. The area of salinized soil in India was as
much as six million hectares and that in Pakistan has expanded to
one million, he added.

"His designation is entirely illegal and invalid," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that by doing so, the Dalai Lama violated religious
rituals and the historical convention, and negated the supreme
authority of the central government in the issue of the
reincarnation of the Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911)
announced the lot-drawing practice in the 58th year (1793) of the
reign of Emperor Qian Long, in a move to eliminate fraud and to
safeguard the authority of the central government in the
reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
"This historical convention has been in effect since
then. There should be no problem in carrying it out," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before his death the tenth Panchen Lama said, "I think the best
way of deciding on my soul boy is to draw lots from a gold urn in
front of the Sakyamuni statue."
</P>
<P>
Jamyang said, "It is beyond reproach that we acted under the
leadership of the central government and according to the will of
the Panchen Lama."
</P>
<P>
On this question the Dalai Lama became "very unpopular" by
raising obstacles and creating chaos, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In our country all people and all organizations including any
religion ought to safeguard the dignity of laws, people's
interests, unity among people of various ethnic groups and the
country's unification," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out: "Whoever breaks laws, damages people's
interests, and disrupts unity among people of various ethnic
groups, and the motherland's unification is bound to fail," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Dalai Lama will thoroughly
abandon his erroneous idea of "independence of Tibet," halt
activities to split the motherland, and return home as early as
possible.

LANZHOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A leading Tibetan living Buddha
today defended the method used in the search for the soul boy of
the Tenth Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government painstakingly followed a procedure, not
introduced in recent times, but established over 200 years ago by
Qing Emperor Qian Long.
</P>
<P>
The emperor introduced the procedure in 1793 to eliminate
fraud and to safeguard the interests of the Chinese government,
said Jamyang Losang Jime Tubdain Qoigyi Nyima, the living Buddha
of the Lapuleng Monastery in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
He was laying down the historic account to stress his view that
the Dalai Lama will never succeed in his plot to split China by
continuing to take advantage of the question of the reincarnation
of the Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
Even today some people abroad continue to make indiscreet
comments on the question, and even go so far as to attack China,
said Jamyang, who is the vice-president of the Buddhism
Association of China.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the Dalai clique took advantage of this question to
step up their activity to split China. We Tibetan monks and
Tibetans are all indignant at this," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the search for the soul boy for the tenth Panchen
Lama was completed long before. The 11th Panchen Lama was
enthroned on December 8, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Jamyang, 48, who is also a vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Gansu Provincial People's Congress, said that the
search and verification of the soul boy for the tenth Panchen Lama
was a "very solemn and serious" event.
</P>
<P>
Three days after the death of the tenth Panchen Lama, the State
Council, China's highest governing body, announced the decision to
search the reincarnated boy of the Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
A group in charge of searching the soul boy was set up soon
after, with living Buddhas and eminent monks from the Zhaxi Lhunbo
Monastery in Tibet serving as principle members.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today expressed
its readiness to help Myanmar develop its financial institutions
following the country's move to establish a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Abu
Hassan Omar said Malaysia was ready to share its experience with
Myanmar in price stabilization and in controlling inflation and to
help train its people in the field of consumerism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after talks with Myanmar Minister of
National Planning David Abel here, Abu Hassan said consumerism was
still a new field in Myanmar and hence Malaysia which had some
years of experience in this area could share its knowledge with
that country.
</P>
<P>
David Abel is accompanying Chairman of the State Law and Order
Restoration Council Than Shwe for a five-day visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia offered to help Myanmar to develop such institutions
as banking, insurance and stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia also gave Myanmar a credit facility of about 30
million U.S. dollars to buy Malaysia's palm oil.
</P>
<P>
At present, Myanmar exports rice, vegetables and fish to
Malaysia which sells palm oil, tobacco and petroleum to that
country.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries last year totaled 683.5 million
ringgit (about 273.4 million dollars) and the trade balance was in

<P>
Deterioration in the pollution of underground water as a result
of growing discharges of harmful elements has not only caused a
water shortage, but is also detrimental to people's health, said
Wang Minjiao, a Chinese hydro-environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, excessive use of underground water will lead to
ground rifts, cave-ins and other geological disasters, as well as
subsidence in some regions.
</P>
<P>
Sun Peishan, an official with the Ministry of Geology and
Mineral Resources, said over 80 percent of geological disasters in
China was brought about by blind felling of trees, excessive use
of underground water and arbitrary construction.
</P>
<P>
Due to a long period of exhaustible extraction of underground
water, the surface of Shanghai, China's largest industrial center,
subsided at a speed of 10 mm a year in the past decade. The Hebei
Plain in north China has subsided by up to 1,000 mm in the past 20
years.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey recently released by the United States,
40 or 60 percent of filling stations have the problem of oil
leakage and a huge amount of oil seeped into the ground. Although
the US government has invested 10 billion US dollars in the
treatment of underground water each year, little result has been
shown.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, protection of underground water has become a
challenging subject in the period up to the next century.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was held as part of the current 30th International
Geological Congress, which has attracted 7,000 geologists from all
over the world.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Takes Bold Move to Raise Bread Price (by Wen Xinian) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government has
announced an increase of bread prices after failing to reach a
compromise with opposition parties and a special committee of the
Lower House of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The move, which was taken Monday, was aimed at removing
subsidies for wheat in line with the kingdom's economic
restructuring program, which was launched in 1989 with the help
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), so as to relieve the
government of heavy burden of subsidies and budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
An informed official source said the government's approach to
dealing with bread prices is aimed at stopping waste and smuggling of
bread, thereby saving the treasury a significant amount and helping to
stabilize the exchange rate of the Jordanian dinars.
</P>
<P>
According to the kingdom's English-language daily "Jordan
Times" today, the increases were announced late Monday by Minister
of Supply Muneer Suber.
</P>
<P>
Suber said Arabic bread produced from Jordanian wheat would
be sold at 180 fils (about 25.2 U.S. cents) per kilogram,
while bread produced from a mixture of Jordanian and imported
wheat at 220 fils (about 30.8 cents) and bread made wholly
from imported wheat at 250 fils (about 35 cents) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the increases, which took effect immediately after
the official announcement, the three types of bread were priced at
 85, 120 and 150 fils respectively per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The government has already announced cash compensation of 1.28
dinars (1.79 dollars) per month for every Jordanian to offset
the increase.
</P>
<P>
The government announcement of the price hike as an
administrative decision came after the executive and legislative
authorities could not reach agreement on the issue and the
government failed to convince the opposition parties and interests
 groups of the need to implement the plan.

<P>
A special committee set up by the Lower House of Parliament
proposed two options but both were turned down by the government
since, as put by an official source here, they did not meet the
basic objective of removing subsidies and cutting government
expenditure.

<HEADLINE> China's Oil, Gas: Untapped Resources Can Meet Future Demands (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China's confirmed oil reserves
will run dry in 20 years, a leading expert has said.
</P>
<P>
But the country's undiscovered fields of below-ground "black
gold" will last well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China's current proven oil reserves are only enough for
development for a dozen years, said experts attending the on-going
30th International Geological Congress in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China has a total of five billion tons of oil in proven
reserves at present, and 2.8 billion of them have been developed,
well-known geologist Li Desheng revealed.
</P>
<P>
At a development speed of 140 million tons of oil annually,
development of the country's remaining proven reserves will be
completed within 20 years, Li told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Proven reserves of natural gas, however, can meet demands for
up to 80 years, he added.
</P>
<P>
But China has an estimated 23.5 billion tons of oil in
geological reserves, which may meet the demand of oil exploration
and development for a long time.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, "China's future for oil discovery is still
optimistic," said Li, who is famous worldwide for his unique
geological theory in oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of China Academy of Sciences (CAS), said that
China's oil still has a large potential that can be
tapped. Oilfields in the Tarim Basin in the northwest have come up
with an ambitious goal to discover at least one billion tons of
oil in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, sinking of oil and gas wells in China has a
history of not more than 50 years, compared with 150 years in the
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
China is sure to find more oil so long as the country pay more
attention to technology upgrading and putting more investments, Li
said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Takes Bold Move to Raise Bread Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposals made by the committee would actually increase the
amount of subsidies for bread, said an official source,
according to another report in the daily.
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the source show that if the government
were to accept the committee's proposals, it would end up
spending 20 million to 30 million dinars (about 28 million to
42 million dollars) in addition to the present annual subsidies
of around 95 million dinars (about 133 million dollars)on bread.
</P>
<P>
Proposals by the special committee suggest the government to
set the new price at 135 fils per kilogram with direct
government compensation of 2.08 dinars (about 2.912 dollars) per
head per month to all the beneficiaries of the National Aid
Fund, or at 150 fils with compensation of 1.28 dinars (about
1.79 dollars) for every Jordanian per month.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's meeting between the government and the parliament,
which failed to reach an agreement, crowned two months of
deliberations between the executive and legislative authorities over
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The government, according to sources, was angry over the
deputies' non-acceptance of the principle of removing subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti repeated that raising the
prices of bread falls within his constitutional powers, which
does not need the endorsement of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of 24 deputies, all from the Islamic
Action Front - an political arm of the Moslem Brotherhood,
boycotted the Parliament session, threating to seek a vote of
non-confidence in the government.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister, who gets full support of king
Hussein, said he will risk his popularity to protect the
national interests and he is ready to face the non-confidence
vote.
</P>
<P>
He had repeatedly said that the government move to increase
the prices of bread will not affect the ordinary Jordanians,
adding that among those who will be affected are the estimated
400,000 non-Jordanian workers in the country as well as an
estimated 1.3 million tourists.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition parties and various interests groups have
not been convinced by the government, insisting that it would
deteriorate the already-poor standard of living and create further
burden to the citizens.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe the government move is not likely to
trigger social unrest as the similar move to increase the
price of fuel in 1989 did.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Waste Polluting Black Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Studies by Russian scientists
show that radioactive waste material from the Chernobyl nuclear
disaster is polluting the Black Sea and its coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Professor Evgeny Kontar from Russia's Shirshov Institute of
Oceanology raised this topic at the 30th International Geological
Congress currently taking place in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear power station exploded
in the former Soviet Union's Ukraine republic, causing great
amounts of nuclear waste containing radiations being washed into
the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
However, different from what people supposed, the nuclear waste
sediment has not been motionless on the sea bed over the past 10
years, but moving regularly with the sea water.
</P>
<P>
Some of the waste has come to the sea surface with the circular
movement of the sea water, while some has entered the ground
through sea-bed valleys and continental shelves.
</P>
<P>
Professor Kontar said that his conclusions were made through
careful study of 42 sediment samples collected from 15 spots of
different depths in the Black Sea and the corresponding
continental shelves.
</P>
<P>
He also warned people that whatever waste they pour into the
rivers and seas will at last come back to harm humans themselves.

<P>
Alaeddin Boroujerdi, Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Pacific,
said that normalization of Islamabad-Kabul ties has always been
on the agenda of Iran's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Iran's welcome to the Islamabad-Kabul ties was reported by the

<HEADLINE> China's Oil, Gas: Untapped Resources Can Meet Future Demands (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past 15 years, with the advancement of technologies in
the fields of geophysics, geochemistry, drilling, and oil
extraction, proven reserves of oil in the world increased rather
than fell, said Professor Li.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the present prediction of the ultimate recoverable
oil and gas resources in the world are 67.3 billion tons and 65
trillion cubic meters of gas more than predicted in 1983.
</P>
<P>
After 150 years of exploitation, oil and gas in the world can
be used for another 72 years and 120 years at least.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Shuiji, a senior geologist with the Ministry of Geology
and Mineral Resources, said that China has paid more attention to
the eastern part than to the west in several decades. The country
is shifting its focus to the west in oil development as a strategy
in the development of its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Even in the eastern Songliao Basin, there is still much
potential to tap, Zheng added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China has not even started to explore the
resource-rich South China Sea, he said.
</P>
<P>
Akio Hara from the Japan National Oil Corporation and Dr. Gauri
K. Handique from Oil India Limited, also hold optimistic views on
China's exploration prospects, saying that as a big country, China
has many places where oil and gas can be found.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has made new discoveries of oil and gas
in several places, such as the Tarim Basin and East China Sea.
"We still have much turnaround in oil and gas exploration, " Li
said.

<HEADLINE> Colleges in Zhejiang Assist Poor Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A helping-hand scheme launched
by colleges and universities in east China's Zhejiang Province has
earned top marks.
</P>
<P>
Since the coastal province's higher learning establishments
introduced a range of measures to finance poor students to finish
their studies two years ago, no students have dropped out because
of financial problems, according to the Provincial Education
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities are aiding poor students through a
variety of channels, an official of the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The first channel is granting scholarships to spur students to
study even harder, and help them overcome difficulties in paying
tuition and other costs.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang University, the leading university in the province,
has set up 20 types of scholarships. It also spends one-third of
its earnings from tuition fees in annual scholarships for
outstanding students.
</P>
<P>
Extending loans is another way to help poor students, with many
colleges establishing a system under which interest-free loans are
extended to poor students.
</P>
<P>
Graduates assigned to work in poor counties designated by the
Zhejiang provincial government and the central government do not
have to repay the principal.
</P>
<P>
Poor students can also receive help from their colleges with
opportunities for part-time jobs. Zhejiang University has provided
such students with 200 regular part-time jobs in the library,
campus radio station and other work places.
</P>
<P>
Some poor students also receive regular or temporary allowances
from university authorities. Some can pay part of the tuition
fees, or are exempted from paying them. Others also get assistance
from their teachers and schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
Teacher Jiang Linna, of Zhejiang Silk Engineering Institute,
donates 2,000 yuan a year to aid a poor student from
underdeveloped Gansu Province until their graduation.
</P>
<P>
The number of poor students has increased since all students
began to pay all of their fees in 1994. Consequently, students
from poor families cannot afford to pay for their tuition, and
face great financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that ten percent of college students in
Zhejiang are poor students.
</P>
<P>
According to a number of college executives and teachers, the
task of assisting and supporting poor students is arduous. But
they all agree that it must be fulfilled so that more personnel
will be trained to invigorate the Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Designates 20 Slaughterhouses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has designated 20
city-level slaughterhouses and 100 large and medium-sized
non-staple stores as pork suppliers, in an effort to improve the
standard of meat supplies in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The move involves measures that will ensure proper animal
vaccination for pigs. The city has also tightened the reins on
pigs coming from outside the city, according to Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
Although the large and medium-sized state-owned slaughterhouses
have a bigger slaughtering capacity, technical equipment and
strict management, they often are short of lifestock for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
Some small slaughterhouses, which play some part in local pig
supplies, have weak quarantine standards, and some of their pigs

<HEADLINE> Non-Swimmer Girl Survives 12-Hour Drift in Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A girl was lucky to be alive
today after a dramatic rescue in China's floods.
</P>
<P>
She was accidentally washed into a fast-flowing river, plunged
into two high dams and miraculously avoided six bridges and
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Twelve hours later she was plucked to safety in a neighboring
province, after being carried 120-kilometers in a torrential river.
</P>
<P>
But what makes her remarkable dice with death even more
staggering is that she can not swim a single stroke.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Cailian, 19, of Jingchuan County, Gansu Province in
northwest China, plunged into the murky depths of the flood-hit
Jinghe River on July 27, according to a report of the
Shanghai-based "Xinmin Evening News".
</P>
<P>
Jiang was suddenly swept into the river by a huge wave when she
was looking for her father near their water-melon field beside the
river, which flooded because of torrential rain one day before.
</P>
<P>
The girl was nearly drowned in the ten-meter-per-second flow
before she realized she could not swim, and by instinct, she
floated on her back with the body stretching straight, like a
backstroke swimmer.
</P>
<P>
Two times, Jiang plunged down into deep water from
flood-control dams, but emerged again.
</P>
<P>
Her death-defying journey also passed through six bridges and
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
She did not realize that her life was on the verge of danger
again when she was plucked to safety by a man -- she was only 500
meters away from another 15-m-high dam.
</P>
<P>
Her rescuer was Wu Jianhui, aged 43, who spotted the girl
floating in the river. He jumped in and swam to her side, and
dragged her to safety. Seconds later she would have tumbled over
the next dam - not knowing whether it would have been third time
unlucky!
</P>
<P>
The location where Jiang was rescued was in Zaoqu Village,
Binxian County of Shaanxi Province. Floating in water for 12 hours
and passing three counties, the girl was uninjured, though her
socks and shoes were washed away.
</P>
<P>
Now the girl has recovered and returned back home, but news
about her staggering experience has spread along the river much
longer than she floated.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Industrial Units Facing Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is facing big pressure
to revive its industrial units as some of them were closed down
and many of them sustained losses.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry Tofael Ahmed was quoted by the local press
as saying that the closure of some units have rendered more than
17,000 jobless in the areas of food, sugar, steel, engineering and
jute.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the situation to faulty policy of the
previous government, saying that more than 5,000 industrial units
were shut down and another 1,580 turned sick during the rule of
the ex-government of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
"These mills and factories have not been closed during our time
-- it is just one and a half months now that we have come to
power. We are rather trying to reopen the closed mills," he added.
</P>
<P>
The present government of the Awami League led by Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina took power on June 23 after defeating the
BNP in the June 12 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government would soon evaluate the situation
and take appropriate measures to revive the viable units and a
realistic industrial policy will be drawn up for the purpose.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Immigration Service
has topped two motor-powered boats which were to smuggle 78
children to Gabon and Cameroun for alleged slave labor and
prostituion.
</P>
<P>
The boats were seized from a private seaport at a border town
in southern Nigeria's Akwa Ibom State and the children comprise
about 40 girls and 38 boys aged 11-17 years, the Guardian
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Most of the children said they paid 10,000 CFA (about 20 U.S.
Dollars) each as transport fare to go and work in farms and
beaches in Gabon and cameroun during holidays.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, owners of private beaches in the
border areas of the state are accused by immigration officers of
obstructing their access to the beaches where clandestine
activities might be thriving.
</P>
<P>
The State Comptroller of Immigration, Babajide Brown, said the
traders often hoodwink the children and some ignorant parents
into the deal of exporting their children for slave labor.

</P>
<P>

Financial Times:
</P>

</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- All pupils should carry out compulsory community services as
part of a radical approach to promoting moral values in schools, a

demonize opposition Labor leader Tony Blair on Monday, with

<HEADLINE> Australian Government Firm To Cut Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Government today
signaled it would not back away from savage spending cuts in the
new budget, despite an opinion poll showing most people supported
the minor parties blocking some budget measures in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Ministers participating in a Cabinet meeting in Sydney to
"fine-tune"  next Tuesday's budget maintained the cuts were
necessary because of the much-touted eight billion Australian
dollars (6.24 billion US dollars) "black hole".
</P>
<P>
When asked if the government may back-off from some budget
measures, Health Minister, Michael Wooldridge, quoted by an
official press release, said "if we want to get jobs going again,
we have to address the black hole, if the public have a problem
they should write to Kim Beazley, that is his legacy."
</P>
<P>
A Herald AGB-McNair poll published in the Sydney Morning Herald
today revealed 60 percent of those surveyed, supported attempts by
the Democrats to reject some Budget proposals on the grounds of
fairness or because they believed the government had broken
promises during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
A total of 60 percent of those surveyed said they supported the
government abandoning planned cuts to higher education, health and
welfare and it should make up any shortfalls in funding by
increasing taxes, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Problems Loom in Eastern German Labor Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The labor market in eastern
Germany is facing prominent problems including high unemployment,
scant apprenticeship for greenhands, the endangered positions for
temporary jobs and tense labor relations, the Federal Labor Office
said.
</P>
<P>
About 1.15 million people are out of work in eastern
Germany. Unemployment rate reached 15.4 percent in July, much
higher than the 10.2 percent rate in western Germany.
</P>
<P>
The problem is even more serious with young people. In eastern
Germany, for every 60,000 young people freshly out of school,
51,500 cannot find jobs, according to sources of the Federal Labor
Office.
</P>
<P>
With the stagnant economy, many businesses have slashed
positions of apprenticeship for greenhands.
</P>
<P>
An austerity plan for cutting financial allocations for
creating temporary jobs is currently under discussion in the
government.
</P>
<P>
The plan, if put into effect, will increase at least another
150,000 jobless people and push the unemployment rate to 20
percent in eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, negotiations between employees and trade
unions have become tougher and complicated over issues of
prolonged working hours and overtime payment.

<HEADLINE> Computer Whiz Arrested in Egypt for Forging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A university student in Egypt's
port city of Alexandria was arrested for forging two million
Egyptian pounds (588,000 U.S. dollars) through his personal
computer, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Moustafa Abdul Moneim, 20, an engineering student,
told police that he had a high-powered portable computer and
decided to use his computer skills to forge bank notes, according
to the English-language newspaper The Egyptian Gazette.
</P>
<P>
The computer whiz printed the bank notes in collaboration with
his brother Ahmed and a friend named Adel M. Ali, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed was quoted as saying that the bank notes were so
perfect and flawless that nobody, except bank experts, would
discover that they were fakes.
</P>
<P>
He said that he first printed a 20-pound note successfully and
this made him think that he could make a fortune through forging
more money.
</P>
<P>
"When I bought some items with the fake note, the shop owner
thanked me for giving him a brand new note, and his compliment
encouraged me to print more and more of this 'fine print,'" he
said.
</P>
<P>
The three youngsters had wanted to sell the fake bank notes to
someone who would distribute them on the Egyptian-Libyan border, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The police arrested them after an informer overheard Adel
talking about "a fake money deal" in a coffee shop, the paper
reported.

PARIS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The 10 African hunger strikers, who were forcibly evacuated
at dawn Monday from the Saint-Bernard Church to hospitals,
returned to their fasting site in the evening. Members of
sympathetic associations and groups of immigrants without
residential papers today began a hunger strike in a relay.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian combat aircraft have stopped pounding Chechnya after
General Alexander Lebed and the chief of staff of the Chechen
separatist force Aslan Maskhadov Monday had a surprise
meeting. Both of them evaluated the meeting as positive.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the Russin Security Council Alexander
Barkhatov said the two men "agreed with each other by 95 percent
on the analysis on the nature of Russian-Chechen relations." The
spokesman for the Chechen separatists Movladi Udugov said Lebed
had proposed a "new approach of solving the conflict" which
"responds to the interests of Russia as well as Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- General Alexander Lebed began an offensive of peace on
Chechnya. His primary talks with Chechen separatist leaders Monday
brought the hope of a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
-- Republican delegates gathering in San Diego Monday paid a
hommage to former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who was
represented at the Republican Convention by his wife Nancy because
of grave illness. General Colin Powell, dubbed "black
Eisenhower" and having refused to run for the White House, made
his first major political intervention Monday evening since he
joined the Republican Party in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
Described as more than a pure Reaganomics ideologue, Jack Kemp
has vowed to win the election for "the Gipper," the surname
Americans attribute to Reagan. But the newest ABC poll showed
Monday that Bill Clinton is still 20 percent ahead of Bob Dole in
support rate.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Interested in Floating "Europeso" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine central bank is
interested in a proposal for floating between 50 million to 70
million U.S. dollars of "europeso" debt instruments in the United
States and Europe, bank sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the bank is studying the proposal made by
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the investment bank subsidiary of the
Deutsche Bank of Germany.
</P>
<P>
"The europeso will attract more foreign companies to establish
operations in the Philippines as they will now be able to access
peso funding for their operations in the country without having to
worry about the need of capital hedging," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Europeso is peso-denominated eurobonds which would be issued by
a triple a-rated financial institution like the World Bank,
Deutsche bank or the Asian Development Bank, with the approval of
the Philippine central bank.

The sources said that the europeso will have a maturity of
between one year to three years and would be exempted from
withholding tax.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Newspaper on Kajiyama's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) severely criticized Japanese Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama for his recent remarks on the
making of a law to cope with "the Korean refugees."
</P>
<P>
These remarks are "the most disgusting provocations against
Korea," said the Rodong Sinmun, a DPRK official newspaper, today
in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out this in fact is part of a plot by the
Japanese reactionaries to legalize their armed suppression of the
Korean people and their organizations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of business leaders in Japan's Yamanashi
Prefecture on August 8, Kajiyama claimed, "if a war breaks out on
the Korean Peninsula, a mass of refugees are expected to come to
Japan."
</P>
<P>
"Street or guerrilla wars are expected when they, with
organizations in Japan, are internally divided and equipped with
arms," he added, thus advocating a law to cope with what he images
might happen.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out, the law Kajiyama advocates is one
for war because Japan has made every preparation, except a law, to
legalize its new aggression and military expansion overseas.
</P>
<P>
The commentary recalled the visit to the Yasukuni shrine by
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and other senior
officials has drawn fierce condemnation from the Asian nations
that suffered greatly from Japanese imperialism during World War
II. Therefore, the Korean people are deeply concerned with
Kajiyama's remarks at this time, said the commentary.

<HEADLINE> BSE to Resume Debt Trade in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bombay Stock Exchange
(BSE) is all set to resume debt market operations in a big way
with 700 securities listed on the bourse in September, it is
learnt here today.
</P>
<P>
The BSE authorities have already firmed up plans for a separate
debt segment "F" in addition to the existing A, B1 and B2 groups.
"F" stands for fixed rate instrument.
</P>
<P>
Bonds, including bonds of the public sector undertakings (PSU)
and non-convertible debentures, will be listed initially in this
segment of the market. "The exchange is doing this to revive
trading in debt instruments and create a retail bond market," the
BSE sources said.
</P>
<P>
The BSE also plans trade in government securities. The
transparency and infrastructural strength of the Bombay on-line
trading system is likely to draw both retail and institutional
investors to the debt market.
</P>
<P>
Debt trading on BSE was discontinued in early 1994 when the
Reserve Bank of India issued a notification asking all
participants to trade on a screen-based exchange. This was at a
time when the Bombay bourse was far from going on-line.

</P>
<P>
After touring the APEC Secretariat's renovated premises on
Monday, the foreign minister reaffirmed Singapore's continued
support for the secretariat, the local newspaper The Straits Times

The three-year-old secretariat now occupies three floors in a
downtown building. Supporting a forum of 18 diverse members with
rapidly growing demands, the secretariat now has 21 professional
staff members seconded here by their governments and 18
locally-hired support staff.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said the permanent building for the APEC secretariat
was being built in Kent Ridge, close to the National University of
Singapore, and would be ready in 1998.

The new secretariat will be part of a 100 million Singapore
dollars (about 70 million US dollars) "brains center" which will
bring together the Institute of Southeast Asian studies, Institute
of Policy Studies, and Civil Service College, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said that as APEC moved towards the implementation of
its vision of free and open trade in the region, the secretariat
would have to play an increasingly important role.

minister said to the secretariat staff, "Let me assure you of our
continued support for the APEC Secretariat".

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sees Swelling External Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's external reserve stood
at 61.23 billion Naira (about 720 million U.S. Dollars) in May
this year, representing a sharp rise of 29.34 percent or 13.88
billion Naira (about 163 million Dollars) from 47.34 billion
Naira (about 557 million Dollars) in March.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bank of Nigeria, the big increase in
the external reserves, which represent a country's foreign
savings, is significant considering a reform carried out in the
Nigerian autonomous foreign exchange market during the month,
which shot up banks' demand for foreign exchange in the market.
</P>
<P>
With the increase, economic watchers said here on Monday that
the country was in a good stead to meet its external financial
obligations for at least four months consecutively.
</P>
<P>
Though figures for April are not yet available, the Central
Bank's return of assets and liabilities as at the cloye of
business on May 31 showed the country's external reserve position
was on the rise, except for March.
</P>
<P>
According to Central Bank statistics, the country's external
reserve stood at 38.53 billion Naira (about 453 million Dollars)
in January and went up to 50.23 billion Naira (about 591 million
Dollars) in February before it dropped to 47.34 billion naira in
March.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank report, which was made available on Monday,
attributed the increase in May to the improvement in the national
investment in foreign government securities and ballance with
foreign banks, apart from the appreciation of the Naira.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Finalizes Draft Law on Company Income Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Finance Ministry has
finalized a draft law on company income tax which will be
submitted to the national assembly for approval at its coming
session scheduled in October.
</P>
<P>
The draft law, if passed, will replace the current income tax
law and will be applied to all Vietnamese and foreign-invested
enterprises and companies with a uniform tax of 30-33 percent per
year, official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
In parallel with the law on foreign investment promulgated in
late 1987, Vietnam has applied two different income tax systems.
</P>
<P>
For foreign-invested businesses, a single annual tax level of
25 percent is levied on enterprises operating in all areas, except
those in the oil and gas sector and other rare and valuable
natural resource areas, which are subject to a tax of 50 percent
per year at maximum.
</P>
<P>
All foreign-invested enterprises, however, are exempted from
taxes on the import of machines and equipment, and means of
transport in favour of capital construction investment at the
beginning of the establishment of the businesses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vietnamese enterprises are liable to a higher level
of income taxes at 35-45 percent per year and tax exemption in
equipment import is only effective for those investment projects
given top priority.
</P>
<P>
The difference in tax tariffs between Vietnamese and
foreign-invested businesses is necessary at the beginning of the
enforcement of the foreign investment law in order to attract more
foreign investment to the country, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, it has not encouraged production for many
domestic enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The company tax bill will remove all differences between
Vietnamese and foreign-invested enterprises and companies in order
to create equal business environment for every enterprise and
company operating in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
While working out a uniform system of income taxes, some taxes
specifically levied on foreign-invested companies and enterprises
such as taxes on imports and reinvestment will be reconsidered in
order to narrow the current gap between foreign and domestic
investment.

The last-stage Israeli-Palestinian talks have been suspended
since the Israeli elections in May. The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) and the Arab world have repeatedly urged Israel
to resume the talks quickly in order to push forward the peace
process overshadowed by the formation of the hardline Likud
government in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Finance Minister Dan Meridor would hold economic talks
with his PNA counterpart Mohammed Zuhdi Nashashibi, while Major
General Oren Shahor would discuss civilian matters with PNA
negotiator Jamil Tarifi Wednesday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military officials and PNA security officials would
also meet Thursday to discuss security matters concerning the
construction of a PNA airstrip in Gaza's Dehaniya area.
</P>
<P>
However, no decision was made as to whether Mordechai would
meet soon with PNA President Yasser Arafat, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Media Reports said that Arafat, annoyed by Netanyahu's
disregard of him, was reluctant to meet any Israeli cabinet
minister before his meeting with the Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai is expected to present a plan for Israeli troops'
redeployment from Hebron, the volatile West Bank town where over
400 Jews live among 120,000 Palestinians, to Netanyahu later this
week.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo peace accords, Israel should
have completed the redeployment by the end of March, which has
been frozen since the suicide bombings by Islamic militants from
late February to early March.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government, under the excuse of protecting the
security of Jewish settlers, attempts to revise the original plan
for redeployment, which called for Israeli withdrawal from 80
percent of Hebron. But the PNA strongly opposes any revision of
the pullout.
</P>
<P>
The PNA welcomed Netanyahu's decision to resume some talks,
while demanding more peace initiatives by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"They are important meetings, but this should not be enough,
as the political issues are still frozen. President Arafat and
Prime Minister Netanyahu should meet to discuss political
issues," Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu Rudeineh was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"We would like a political liaison committee ... This is the
practical starting point for doing business, the sooner the
better," Rudeineh added.

<HEADLINE> Substitute of Medical Gauze to Save Money for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A carbon material replacement
for widely used medical gauze wound dressing will cut China's
health bill by more than 300 million yuan (36 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The material, which has already passed the state appraisal, has
been developed jointly by a hi-tech wear-resistant material
development company, and the Material Science and Engineering
Department of Beijing's famous Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
The material is made from graphite, a rich resource in China,
and can be used for both aseptic and bacterial wounds, scientists
said.
</P>
<P>
They said that it has proved harmless to human body and caused
no allergic reactions in patients.
</P>
<P>
At least 30,000 tons of medical gauze, worth at 1.68 billion
yuan (202 million US dollars), is consumed each year by over 2,000
hospitals at and above county level in China.
</P>
<P>
If 20 percent of the gauze is replaced by the new material, 336
million yuan can be saved each year as well as 8,000 hectares of
farmland.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the material will give good economic returns
after it is produced on a large-scale.

<HEADLINE> Over 300 People Arrested for Drug-Related </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 384 people were
arrested by the police for drug-related offences between January
and June this year, a police spokesperson said here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Inspector Andrew Kadungure of the Drugs Squad of the
Police Criminal Investigation Department said Zimbabwe, which
used to be a transit point for drugs, was slowly developing a
market for some hard drugs like cocains and heroin.
</P>
<P>
''Hard drugs of virtually all description are now available in
Zimbabwe in varying quantities, but mostly on transit to regional
and overseas destinations where lucrative markets exist,'' said
Kadungure.
</P>
<P>
He said of the 384 people arrested, seven were foreigners.
</P>
<P>
''The drug first surfaced in late 1990 with the influx of west
African nationals. Its trafficking has over the years remained in
the control of west Africans with Zimbabweans being used mostly
as local peddlers and to a lesser extent couriers to other
destinations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said because of the common practice amongst traffickers to
create new markets, as the traditional ones get saturated, there
had been an emergence of a cocaine market in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
''Despite meaningful seizures of cocaine by police,
intelligence indicates that the drug is being abused in the
country. However, its abuse has remained confined to the affluent
members of the Zimbabwean community, notably the white sector
where the problem is growing,'' said Kadungure.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Argentine sccoer star
Diego Maradona was travelling to a private clinic in Switzerland
for a 12-day treatment on his drug habit.
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing this for my daughters who mean more than anything
to me and I'm saying this so everyone knows I want to get totally
cured," Maradona told local television. "I'm told there's an 80
percent chance they will cure my addiction. I'll make up for the
rest with grit and courage."
</P>
<P>
The former Argentine captain, who announced he was quitting
Boca Juniors on Sunday, boarded a plane for Switzerland at 10
p.m. local time on Monday, according to the state news agency
Telam.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, 35, was twice suspended from soccer for using drugs
-- in 1992 when he was playing for Italian club Napoli and during
the 1994 World Cup in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He has also been arrested for cocaine possession in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
"The Swiss clinic was recommended to me by a friend and I'm
going because in Argentina many doctors instead of treating you
and curing you just take your money," Maradona said.

BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Two of China's top
anti-corruption bodies are to check how clean are the country's
top party and government officials.
</P>
<P>
The Central Commission for Disciplinary Inspection of the

The inspections will mostly target high-ranking officials,
especially those at the provincial and ministerial-levels.
</P>
<P>
The inspection drive, starting from Mid-August to early
September, will mainly focus on four aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- abuses of power by officials in housing-related affairs;
</P>
<P>
-- how rules restricting officials from dining and

<HEADLINE> S.African Police Supports National Convention on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The South African Police
Union (SAPU) on Monday expressed its support of a national
convention on crime, saying South Africans were losing faith in
the authorities' ability to deal with crime.
</P>
<P>
A local daity "The Citizen" today quoted the SAPU source as
saying that a national convention on crime would go a long way in
showing the South African community and the world that "our
country's leaders are serious in addressing this threat to our
future".
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria on Monday, the SAPU
suggested that such a convention should be followed with a
practical programme of action, but not vague plans or statements
of commitment.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday last week, former cabinet Minister Pik Botha urged
President Nelson Mandela and other South African leaders to call
a national convention on crime.
</P>
<P>
Botha said South Africa had to prove to the world that it had
the will to get rid of crime, and to make the country one of real
freedom, and a destination for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The SAPU statement also noted that the fact that it is
expected from " an underpaid, understaffed and poorly equipped
police service to deal with this (crime) situation is outrageous.
</P>
<P>
It appealed the government to improve the working and living
conditions of police officials in order to stop crime from
engulfing the country.
</P>
<P>
Due to the high crime rate in South Africa, police has
increasingly become the target of criminals when they are
performing their duties.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 200 police officials had been
murdered by criminals in the past two years.

exhibition in July, 1995 was regarded as the most successful,
attracting more than thirty thousand visitors in 18 days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local government is heavily promoting Tibetan
art in the province. A Tibetan art group was formed and sent on
tour to Canada and the United States.

BANGKOK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry has
submitted a notice to the World Trade Organization (WTO) saying it
intends to hire a group of attorneys from the European Union (EU)
to sue the US government for trade discrimination on shrimp
products from Thailand.
</P>

US shrimp regulations state that the US does not import shrimp
products manufactured by any environment-damaging process or

prevents sea turtles from being caught.
</P>
<P>
The regulations have been effective since July 1 this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar opposition
Civic United Front (CUF) must recongnize the government of
Zanzibar and Salmin Amour as the president before any
discussions to be held, the Zanzibar government said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
State House Spokesman Hafidh Ali told a Dar es Salaam
newspaper in a telephone interview from Zanzibar that CUF leader
Seif Sariff Hamad should not pursue the matter by holding rallies
on the Mainland.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were meant to signal the position of Amour's
government after Hamad addressed a public rally in Dar es Salaam
late last week. The Dar es Salaam rally was held after Hamad had
consistently been denied the opportuniy do hold a public meeting
in Zanzibar for what the police routinely allege as "security"
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Hamad said at the rally last week that the CUF was ready to
talk to the Isles government. He said that this position had been
made clear at the discussions between the CUF leadership
and Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Secretary General of the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
Chief Anyaoku last week urged the two parties in Zanzibar to
solve their differences amicably to ease political tension there
during his three-day tour of Zanzibar on investigating into
Zanzibar elections held last October.
</P>
<P>
The CUF has been boycotting the House of Representatives
sessions since last October general elections. It has refused the
results of presidential election, accusing that the election has
been "rigged". It has also been accusing the government of human
rights abuse.

<HEADLINE> Heroin Price in Thailand Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The price of heroin in Thailand
has risen sharply since drug warlord Khun Sa surrendered to the
Myanmar government early this year, according to the Thai
Narcotics Control Board.
</P>
<P>
In Bangkok, the price of number 4 grade is now about 5,000 baht
(200 US dollars) per 100-gram bag, the local newspaper The Bangkok
Post reported today, quoting deputy secretary-general of the board
Narong Suwanpien.
</P>
<P>
The price is about 15,000 baht (600 US dollars) in the south of
Thailand and 1,500 baht (60 US dollars) in the north of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa and his Mong Tai army surrendered to the Myanmar
government in January. At that time, a 100-gram bag of heroin was
only about 400 baht (16 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, 1,267,000 people are addicted to drugs -- 300,000
to heroin and the rest to amphetamines, solvents and marijuana,
the Thailand Development Research Institute estimates.
</P>
<P>
The illicit drug business almost came to a halt after the
Myanmar army overran Khun Sa's stronghold, but some ethnic
minorities are still manufacturing heroin near the Thai border,
Narong said.
</P>
<P>
According to Narong, the Thai Narcotics Control Board will seek
cabinet approval for 1.175 billion baht (47 million US dollars) of
funds to be used by some 45 agencies to solve the problem.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republicans Pledge to Fight Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN DIEGO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Republicans pledged
here today to fight against growing international terrorism at
home and abroad if they win the U.S. presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"A Republican president will forcefully lead the world
community to isolate and punish state sponsors of terrorism," the
Republicans said in a platform passed at the first day of the
four-day national convention in this western U.S. coastal city.
</P>
<P>
They said that if their presumptive candidate Bob Dole defeated
incumbent U.S. President Bill Clinton, the Republican
administration would "be proactive, not reactive, to strike the
hand of terrorism before it can be raised against the Americans."
</P>
<P>
The Republicans' announcement is triggered by a recent wave of
terrorist bombings in the U.S. During the Atlanta Olympic Games on
July 27, a pipe bomb exploded in the nearby Olympic Park, killing
two people and injuring 110. The U.S. police also suspect the TWA
Flight 800 explosion that killed all 230 passengers and crew as
terrorist attack though the cause is still to be investigated.
</P>
<P>
One of three candidates in the forthcoming presidential
election, Bob Dole arrived Sunday at San Diego to claim his
long-sought presidential nomination. Terrorism is among the most
concerned problems in the U.S. public.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has already taken actions in this
respect and, accusing Iran and Libya of being the world's leading
sponsors of state terrorism, signed a bill to impose sanctions on
foreign companies to invest in the two countries. But the
Republicans want to do more.
</P>
<P>
"We denounce terrorist attacks made on American citizens at
home or abroad. We must take all legitimate steps to swiftly
apprehend and severely punish persons committing terrorism," the
Republican declaration stressed.

<HEADLINE> Iran Conditionally Accepts Turkey-Proposed Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran has conditionally accepted
a Turkish proposal for a four-way regional security summit, in
which Iraq will be invited to join Iran, Turkey and Syria, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati made the statement
that is carried in today's English daily "Iran News."
</P>
<P>
However, Velayati stressed that "participation of Iraq or any
other party should be contingent upon the approval of the
three countries."
</P>
<P>
"We insist that tripartite consultations, which have long
been overdue, should immediately commence to tackle the issue of
Northern Iraq," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Baghdad government lost control of Northern Iraq in
1991 when the U.S.led coalition forces ousted the Iraqi forces from
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said "the issue of inclusion
of the Iraqi regime in such a parley should first be
discussed during the tripartite meeting and a final decision
should be made there."
</P>
<P>
Iran, Turkey and Syria are members of the tripartite
committee, which was formed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day visit, Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan proposed the four-way summit between Iran, Iraq, Turkey
and Syria be held to discuss the current deteriorating situation
in Northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the Turkish proposal is very clear that
Turkey wants to solve the problem of anti-government group of PKK
by resorting to military means in Northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Iran announced Monday that they have joined
hands in fighting Turkish anti-government group PKK, thereby settling
the thorny issue between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan stressed that the border regions must remain peaceful
and tranquil, saying that Turkey is willing to cooperate with Iran
to uproot terrorist activities throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
"Our cooperation in this respect will be important
bilaterally, regionally and internationally," he said.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources told Xinhua that Turkey has obtained
pledge from the Iranian side that Tehran will keep silent
over any military operation against PKK in northern Iraq.

Included in the package are the extension of land-leasing
periods, granting more autonomy to localities in approving the use
of land, encouraging business people to invest in land
exploitation, and purchasing more farm produce.
</P>
<P>
The multi-ethnic region, which has been designated as the

production base, covers one sixth of the country's territory, and
has about 10 million hectares of uncultivated areas suitable for
farming.
</P>
<P>
As a result, business people from Israel, Canada, the United
States and Hong Kong have joined Chinese pioneers to set up land
development projects in Xinjiang.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Open National Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN DIEGO, United States, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Republicans
opened their four-day National Convention today to nominate their
candidate for the November 5 presidential election in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting finalized the Republican platform, which
specifies GOP's (Grand Old Party) views on domestic and foreign
policies.
</P>
<P>
The document, entitled "Restoring the American Dream",
advocates an income tax cut as well as toughening national defense.
</P>
<P>
"American families deserve better," the platform says. "They
should be allowed to keep more of their hard-earned money so they
can spend on their priorities, as opposed to sending
ever-increasing amounts to Washington to be spent on the
priorities of federal bureaucrats."
</P>
<P>
The Republicans supported an across-the-board, 15-percent tax
cut to marginal tax rates, the platform says.
</P>
<P>
The 94-page document also calls for hardline defense and
foreign policies, including an immediate expansion of NATO,
development and deployment of a nationwide anti-missile system in
the U.S., continued nuclear testing, withdrawal of U.S. troops
from Bosnia, closer ties with Israel, toughened ties with Russia,
and tighter measures against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, who is widely
presumed to be the Republican candidate for the presidential race,
arrived in San Diego for the convention on Sunday after concluding
a busy week defining the course of his autumn campaign, and
formally announcing his vice-presidential choice, Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
Kemp was former secretary of housing and urban development.
Before his appointment, he represented the Buffalo area and
Western New York for 18 years, from 1971 to 1989, in the House of
Representatives. He served for seven years in the Republican
leadership as chairman of the house republican leadership
conference.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, Dole laid out an economic plan featuring, among
other measures, a 15-percent across-the-board cut in income tax
rates and a halving of capital gains taxes.
</P>
<P>
The Republican presidential challenger's proposal is expected
to spur the economic growth and revive his campaign.
</P>
<P>
Dole said earlier: "My mission in running for president is to
give our nation a new birth of freedom, starting with a historic,
across-the-board tax cut for every man, woman and child in
America."
</P>
<P>
Dole's plan has become the focus of the ongoing Republican
convention, which is being attended by party officials and 1,990
delegates, chosen in primaries and caucuses across the country.
</P>
<P>
The number of delegates needed for the official nomination of
the presidential candidacy is 996.

convention in Long Beach, California. Perot and former Colorado
Governor Richard Lamm are vying for the party's nomination.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Attract More Japanese Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) has targeted to achieve one million Japanese
tourists this year.
</P>
<P>
To attain the goal, a research made with support from the
government's Thailand Research Fund, suggested that the country
should focus its marketing approaches on the segments of tourists
whose activities are not dangerous to the local ecology.
</P>
<P>
These segments include family travelers, young working women,
elderly people, students and repeaters of these groups.
</P>
<P>
Currently Thailand has a too large percentage of single male
travelers, which is believed possibly related to prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The research also calls upon private Thai tour operators to
join hands with small service providers at local destinations to
develop environmentally and ecologically-concerned programs for
these quality Japanese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Last year 900,000 Japanese arrived in Thailand, the second
largest number of foreign arrivals, behind only Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Japanese travelers recorded the highest average spending of
about 173 U.S. dollars per head per day, according to TAT
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's total foreign tourist arrivals last year were 6.9
million, who spent nearly 8 billion dollars during their stays in
the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN DIEGO, United States, August 12 (Xinhua)-- The Republicans
are insisting that the United States develop and deploy a
nationwide anti-missile system, despite repeated rejections by the
Bill Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to deploy a land- and sea-based missile
defense as soon as possible, and a national system thereafter,"
said a Republican platform passed today for the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2,000 Republican delegates from across the United States
gathered here for a four-day convention in this port city to
nominate the party's candidate for the White House.
</P>
<P>
The 94-page platform, entitled "Restoring the American Dream",
criticized incumbent President Clinton for slashing the funding
budgeted by the last two Republican administrations for building
the nationwide missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
"America will be increasingly threatened by long-range
ballistic missiles in the future," the platform said.
</P>
<P>
It also called for continued nuclear testing and rejection of
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the danger of a missile attack with nuclear,
chemical or biological weapons "is the most serious threat" to
U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
But the Clinton administration would hardly agree.
</P>
<P>
It has said that at least for 10 or 15 years the United States
would not face the danger of being attacked by ballistic missiles
from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration warned that the Republican plan for
the deployment of the nationwide anti-ballistic missile system
violates the U.S.-Russia Anti-Ballistic Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Republican platform also called for a supply-side tax-cut
economic plan and the restoration of American world leadership.
</P>
<P>
Bob Dole, who has won most of the Republican presidential
primaries in the past few months, is widely expected to be
formally accepted as the party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Dole flew in on Sunday from his hometown, Russell, Kansas.
Dole and his newly-chosen vice-president running mate, Jack Kemp,
hopped a harbor ferry to the convention site.
</P>
<P>
Dole announced Kemp as his running mate late Friday. The
choice, which the former U.S. Senate majority leader described as
the most important decision in his campaign, has reportedly
provided a dramatic boost to the Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
Dole's former campaign rival, radio commentator Pat Buchanan,
also endorsed him for the presidential bid.

<TEXT>
<P>
New Delhi, August 13 ( Xinhua ) -- Airbus Industrie has
launched a new, multi-million crore advertising campaign in India,
which it considers an important strategic market.
</P>
<P>
The new campaign is Airbus Industrie's first in India to
feature television and includes print advertising in a number of
key daily newspapers and weekly magazines.
</P>
<P>
All of the advertisements feature Airbus Industrie's flagship
A340 airliner, which has the longest range in the world. The
ability of the A 340 to fly non-stop from India to America, one of
the features of interest to flag-carrier Air-India, is an
important theme of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
"The quietest cabin in the sky" is one of the messages of the
television ads, which features an aircraft of Airbus Industrie's
largest A340 customer, Singapore Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Airbus Industrie forecasts a market for 275 airlines worth 30
million US dollars up to the year 2014. Potential customers for
Airbus Industrie's aircraft, which currently account for 60
percent of the fleets of Air-India and India Airlines, include
these two carriers as well as private airlines.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Reaffirms Stand on Open Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) reaffirms its stand on opening its
airspace to all international civil aircraft by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Central News Agency quoted a spokesman of the DPRK
General Bureau of Civil Aviation as saying on Monday that the DPRK
"will welcome and actively help the passage of all civil airliners
through its airspace."
</P>
<P>
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced on
August 2 that the DPRK will allow all international civil
aircraft to pass through its airspace as of December this year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that since joining the International Air
Passage Agreement in January last year, the DPRK has discussed
with the IATA guarantees of safe passage for international civil
aircraft through DPRK airspace and measures on other practical
issues.
</P>
<P>
"This is patent proof that our measures to open the airspace
are being promoted in real earnest at the practical stage," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, he denounced some "dishonest forces" for slandering
the DPRK by spreading false information about its stand on open
airspace.
</P>
<P>
The IATA and world civil aviation companies believe the opening
of DPRK airspace will greatly cut the flight time, fuel
consumption and help save expenses.

<HEADLINE> Colombia to Continue Eradicating Drug Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government will stick to its policy to eradicate coca and poppy
crops despite a compromise reached with the striking peasants,
Defense Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra said today.
</P>
<P>
In order to end the three-week strike by the farmers in the
province of Putumayo, the government agreed on Sunday to set up 12
subcommittees to study the various aspects concerning the
establishment of a coca-free Putumayo.
</P>
<P>
The government promised that the farmers of nine municipalities
in central and northern Putumayo who voluntarily join a crop
substitution program will receive 375 dollars each hectare for the
illegal crops eradicated.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said that the agreement will in no way
prevent the national government and the security forces from the
commitment to eradicate coca crops by aerial fumigation.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Esguerra also denied rumors that the army cheated coca
farmers who requested to withdraw from growing drug crops.
</P>
<P>
The army has always kept its word to help those who wanted to
quit from drug trafficking, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Allows Food Aid to Reach Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has permitted the World
Food Program (WFP) to send humanitarian food aid through its
territory to the more than 700,000 war refugees in the landlocked
Burundi which is now under regional economic sanctions, a WFP
official confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's decision means that some humanitarian aid can get
moved almost immediately. Under a contingency plan, the WFP has
prepositioned six trucks of aid materials at Isaka, about 350
kilometers from its border with Burundi, said a WFP press release.
</P>
<P>
They are not expected to enter Burundi until this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's decision was welcomed by WFP Executive Director
Catherine Bertini.
</P>
<P>
She hoped that the same spirit of cooperation will prevail
among the other countries of the region to ensure that
humanitarian relief operations are not derailed.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 2,000 tons of WFP relief materials have been
blocked at Kigoma on the shore of Lake Tanganyika. This aid was
destined for the refugees in eastern Zaire and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
An additional 3,000 tons of WFP aid materials were delayed in
Dar es Salaam and Isaka.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, together with Kenya, has imposed a tight air, road,
rail and water embargo on the tiny central African country to try
to return the country to constitutional order.
</P>
<P>
In order to let WFP aid to reach Burundi, the United Nations
sent letters to Tanzania and Kenya on August 6, saying that unless
a special permission was granted under the embargo, the plight of
those in need would dramatically deteriorate.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Romania has launched its
biggest seagoing vessel, a mineral carrier of 170,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The mineral carrier equipped with advanced navigation
facilities was built by the Constanta Shipyard, based on a foreign
patent, and launched on the shores of the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
It is 298 meters long, 46 meters wide and 24.4 meters high and
has a deck area three times the size of a soccer field. It draws
18 meters and cruises 13.6 knots.
</P>
<P>
The vessel was ordered by a Dutchman and it will be registered
in Hong Kong after sea trials.
</P>
<P>
The Constanta Shipyard is one of the largest among 12 shipyards
in Romania. They are designed to build mineral carriers, oil
tankers, cargo vessels and tugboats of various types and
tonnages. The biggest oil carrier Romania has built had a tonnage
of 150,000.
</P>
<P>
As Romania is in a transitional economic period, the shipyards
don't have enough orders. The government is working hard to help
them gain domestic and foreign orders.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republicans Urge Tax Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN DIEGO, United States, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Republicans are
urging the U.S. government to relieve Americans of "near-record"
income taxes to build a better future for families and communities.
</P>
<P>
A platform passed at the Republican National Convention, which
began here on Monday, says American families are suffering from
the twin burdens of stagnant incomes and near-record taxes.
</P>
<P>
The tax burdens, described as "the key cause of middle-class
anxiety" by the platform, were said to have made people feel they
were working harder, but falling further behind.
</P>
<P>
There was also fear that the current generation would not be as
successful as the previous and its children would be worse off.
</P>
<P>
The platform set forth the Republican formula for growth,
opportunity and a better family life: "Trust the people, cut their
taxes, scale back the size and scope of government, foster jobs
creation, and get out of the way."
</P>
<P>
Federal, state, and local taxes took more than 38 cents in
every dollar the American family earned, and the federal tax
burden alone was now approaching a record 25 percent of family
income, the platform said.
</P>
<P>
American families deserved better. They should be allowed to
keep more of their hard-earned money so they could spend on their
priorities, as opposed to sending ever-increasing amounts to
Washington to be spent on the priorities of federal bureaucrats,
it added.

<P>
MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 300 MORO National Liberation
Front (MNLF) rebels have occupied four towns in Zamboanga Del
Norte province in the second such incident which apparently
violates the ceasefire agreement it signed with the Philippine
government, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas landed over the weekend in the coastal towns of
Sirawal, Sibuco, Siocon and Baliguian in the province and were
moving freely in the towns, but no terrorist acts have been
reported.
</P>
<P>
Superintendent Merlito Te, the Zamboanga police director, said
he would report the incident to higher headquarters. He said a
protest may be filed over the violation of the ceasefire before
the joint ceasefire committee of the country.
</P>
<P>
The committee had earlier persuaded some 200 MNLF fighters who
occupied Lanmong island off Zamboanga city since July 26 to pull
out, averting what could have been a bloody confrontation with
government troops who were ready to storm the island.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Renato De Villa warned after the withdrawal
that the MNLF were not allowed to expand the territories under its
control by repeating such an incident.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Austrian President Thomas Klestil
and Prime Minister Franz Vranitzky today sent condolences to
Austrian peacekeepers injured in Sunday's bloody clashes between
Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
In the bloodshed, one Greek Cypriot was beaten to death and
about 70 Cypriot civilians on both sides were injured.
</P>
<P>
Nine Austrian soldiers were wounded after being pelted with
stones by the demonstrators, who broke into the United
Nations-policed buffer zone dividing Greek and Turkish citizens in
the island state.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian defense ministry said that the soldiers were not
badly injured and had returned to their mission.
</P>
<P>
Three other peacekeepers, one from Hungary and two from
Ireland, were also injured in the riot.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister urged the two sides on the island to support
the work of the U.N. peacekeepers and make every effort for a
peaceful solution to their problem.
</P>
<P>
Austria sent a 314-member contingent as part of the
1,200-strong U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Of 37,000 military men sent by Austria for U.N. peacekeeping
missions since 1960, 32 have died in operations.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Greek Cypriot motorcyclists pushed through the
U.N.-controlled Green Line in Cyprus and clashed with Turkish
troops and Turkish Cypriots who also broke into the buffer zone.

<HEADLINE> NATO Takes Precautions Against Bosnian Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led implementation
force (IFOR) has taken precautions against Bosnian Serbs to
protect its personnel and other internationals although the Serbs
promised not to block IFOR inspection of its military facilities.
</P>
<P>
IFOR introduced the precautions code-named "Operation Fear
Naught" beginning at 2:00 p.m. local time Monday after the Serbs
refused to allow NATO inspection of a military facility at the
Serb army headquarters of Hans Pijesak.
</P>
<P>
The precautions, aimed at protecting Western personnel from
being attacked by Serbs if IFOR uses force against Serbs, are
bringing isolated military units to defensible bases and
evacuating U.N. police and international workers out of the Serb
territory.
</P>
<P>
The intension was later scaled down after NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana won the Serbs' consent to allow
inspection in the next 24 hours in a meeting with acting Bosnian
Serb President Biljana Plavsic in Pale, the Serb mountain
stronghold outside Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
However, IFOR said the operation would continue at least until
the Han Pijesak facility has had been inspected satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
"Fear Naught is still under way," said NATO's Major Brett
Boudreau. "Until we are certain that the inspection regime is
back on track we will continue to have Operation Fear Naught in
place."
</P>
<P>
Han Pijesak is the headquarters of the Serb army commander
General Ratko Mladic, indicted as "war criminal" by the
international tribunal in The Hague, who could face the danger of
being arrested by IFOR, if running into an IFOR inspection team.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Exports to S. America to Reach 5.2 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's exports to Latin
American countries totalled 4.452 billion U.S. dollars in 1995 and
will increase by 17.5 percent this year to 5.2 billion dollars,
says a bank report published today.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by the state-owned National Foreign Trade
Bank, said that Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela were the
most important markets in Latin America for Mexican products in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, which had not signed a free trade agreement with
Mexico, was the biggest buyer of Mexican products taking 18
percent of Mexico's exports to Latin America last year.
</P>
<P>
Chile, which had a trade agreement with Mexico, was the second
biggest customer of Mexican merchandise, accounting for 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Colombia and Venezuela, Mexico's free trade partners in the
Group of Three, represented 10 and 9 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The report said Argentina, Guatemala and Cuba each took eight
percent and Peru four percent of Mexico's exports to that region.
</P>
<P>
The report also highlighted the importance of free trade
agreements signed by Mexico with Costa Rica, Bolivia, Chile,
Venezuela and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Mexico was negotiating similar joint agreements with Guatemala,
Honduras and El Salvador, and individual ones with Ecuador and
Nicaragua, it added.
</P>
<P>
Mexico formalized a multilateral agreement with the Latin
American Free Trade Association countries and signed the Act of
Trade Cooperation with the 25-member Association of Caribbean
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's trade with the South American Common Market (Mercosur)
countries reached two billion dollars a year. Mercosur groups
Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown on Fake Renminbi Planned in Shanghai and Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Officials in Guangzhou and
Shanghai have called for closer inspection of currency in the face
of rising numbers and value of fake renminbi, reported today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, Guangzhou City checked out
105,726 pieces of counterfeit renminbi, with a total value of more
than 5.53 million yuan (666,000 US dollars), according to the
Guangzhou branch of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Criminal cases involving fake renminbi are increasing
nationwide, and traffickers in illegal money are using Guangzhou
as a hub to spread the fake paper inland.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 18 months, Guangzhou Public Security Bureau has
invested 169 cases of fake renminbi.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent of the fake paper discovered in Guangzhou was
either 100 yuan (12.05 US dollars) or 50 yuan (6.02 US dollars)
denominations, but smaller denominations -- notes for ten yuan,
five yuan, two yuan and one yuan -- are also pervading the city.
</P>
<P>
Local bus firms, 80 percent of which use automatic
ticket-vending machines, were the first to suffer from the smaller
fake notes. On the average, each big bus company was losing about
10,000 yuan (1,200 US dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials also warned people not to exchange foreign
currency in the street, as counterfeit foreign money is also on
the increase.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou authorities have found fake US dollars, Hong Kong
dollars, Japanese yan, German marks, French franc and British
pounds. The US dollars is the most frequently copied currency,
said Ling Fengjuan, director of the cashier department of BOC
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the fake money is brought into China by overseas
counterfeiters or their agents," said Ling.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, too, is co-ordinating a thorough-going crack-down on
counterfeit bank notes and those who make and distribute them.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Mayor Hua Jianmin told a meeting of the Shanghai Working
Conference against Counterfeit Money last week that discoveries of
fake bank notes increased by about 14 percent in the city during
the first half of this year, while the face value of the
counterfeit bills increased by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city's financial organizations will implement a system
based on certifying bank tellers to ferret out counterfeit
money. The tellers will have to pass an examination to get a
certificate.

MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The MORO National Liberation
Front (MNLF) and the Philippine government will sign here on
September 2 the final peace accord to resolve the 26-year-old
Muslim rebellion in Mindanao, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
"A few days (from now) I will be travailing to Jakarta for the
final accord. On September 2 I will go to Malacanang (the
presidential palace in Manila) to sign the final text of the

</P>
<P>
Misuari said the signing ceremony will be attended by
representatives of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
which has more than 40 Muslim countries in its membership, and

August 28 to initial the peace pact and then the final agreement
will go to Manila for signing.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decades, the MNLF has been fighting for autonomy

<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Sunday will be a big day for
people in the beauty and hair-dressing business as the '96 Beijing
International Hair and Beauty Festival opens at the Beijing
International Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" reports that the festival will bring
together people from the beauty and hair-dressing service sector,
the research sector and the manufacturing sector for cosmetics and
make-up products and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The festival will include international contests between
Chinese and foreign specialists, exchanges of techniques on beauty
and hair-dressing, lectures by Chinese and foreign experts and
exhibitions of Chinese and foreign products and equipment, the
paper quoted an official with the organizing committee as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 people from Asian countries and regions will
participated in this event, which has been approved by the
Ministry of Internal Trade and will be sponsored by the China
Hair-dressers and Beauticians Association and the Hong Kong-based
CK Hair International Ltd, the official said.
</P>
<P>
As the country's economy improves, people are more attentive to
diet and "self-image" and the changing face of beauty is becoming
big busness in China, with the number of make-up manufacturers and
beauty salons in the country rising sharply.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the number of beauty and
hairdressing outlets jumped from 10,000 in 1979 to more than
700,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of people employed in the sector has risen from
100,000 fifteen years ago to over 1 million last year.
</P>
<P>
There were only 288 cosmetics manufacturers in 1956 with annual
sales of 56.78 million yuan (6.84 million US dollars). The number
of producers has increased to 3,000 with sales of 11 billion yuan
(1.325 billion US dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official today
said that his country and Chile are looking for ways to solve the
seven-year-old grape trade problem between them.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Davidow, U.S. assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, said: "We have an excellent dialogue with
Chile and we are going to find a way to solve the problem."
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after meeting Chilean Foreign Minister
Jose Miguel Insulza and Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma.
</P>
<P>
In March 1989, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration detected
some imported Chilean grapes poisoned with cyanide and suspended
all imports of grape from Chile, causing more than 200 million
U.S. dollars in loss to Chilean exporters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. justice department later denied payment of
compensation to Chilean exporters of grape.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed assistant secretary of state, who arrived
here on a three-day visit, brought with him a proposal related to
the promotion of sales of Chilean fruits in the United States.

LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal club manager Bruce Rioch

<P>
The dismissal, coming on the eve of the Premiership season, has

It is believed the club board has already found a replacement

Highbury.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Stewart Houston and Pat Rice have been placed
in charge of the club, which placed in the fifth position last
season with even the Dutch star Dennis Bergkamp and England ace
David Platt to the club.
</P>
<P>
Rioch was fired after criticism involving Arsenal's failure to

<HEADLINE> Republicans Urge Tax Relief for Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN DIEGO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Republicans have called for
tax relief for economic growth in order to build a better future
for families and communities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
American families are suffering from the twin burdens of
stagnant incomes and near-record taxes, says the platform passed
at the Republican National Convention which began here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Calling the two burdens of the "key cause of middle-class
anxiety," the platform says it is why people feel they are working
harder, but falling further behind; why they fear the current
generation will not be as successful as the last generation; why
they believe their children will be worse off; and why they feel
so anxious about their own economic future.
</P>
<P>
For millions of families, the American Dream is fading, the
platform says. "Our goal is to revive it, renew it, and extend it
to all who reach for it."
</P>
<P>
The platform sets forth the Republican formula for "growth,
opportunity, and a better family life as: "Trust the people, cut
their taxes, scale back the size and scope of government, foster
jobs creation, and get out of the way."
</P>
<P>
Federal, state, and local taxes take more than 38 cents out of
every dollar the American family earns, and the federal burden
alone is now approaching a record 25 percent of family income, the
platform says.
</P>
<P>
American families deserve better, the platform says. They
should be allowed to keep more of their hard-earned money so they
can spend on their priorities, as opposed to sending
ever-increasing amounts to Washington to be spent on the
priorities of federal bureaucrats.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Troops Placed on Heigh Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- IFOR troops in Bosnia went on
high security alert after receiving indications that American
troops could come under attack from Islamic terrorists, a NATO
official said today.
</P>
<P>
The official who was speaking on condition of anonymity said
the alert level had been raised late last week, and U.S. soldiers
had stepped up control along roads throughout Bosnia, according to
Tanjug news agency report.
</P>
<P>
The threat appeared to pertain to troops stationed in territory
controlled by Muslims, Tanjug added.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Brett Boudreau, a spokesman for the NATO-led force, said:
"We had a reason to believe that there may be elements who
potentially have made threats against IFOR."
</P>
<P>
Boudreau also announced that NATO had banned flights by the
Bosnian Serbs following their refusal to allow the peace force to
inspect a military site on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the disagreement was settled today after a meeting between
acting Serb President Biljana Plavsic and Peter Feith, political
adviser to IFOR commander, in Serb capital Pale, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
Boudreau described the current state of alert as "medium,"
which obliges all soldiers to wear flak jackets and helmets all
the time and not to travel alone.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Michael Walker, Commander of the NATO ground force this
afternoon initiated an operation code-named "Fear Naught" to
protect all IFOR troops in Bosnia, Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
The alert announcement coincided with the arrival of NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana and Supreme allied commander in
Europe, Gen. George Joulwan in Sarajevo today, who had held talks
with leaders of both Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb
republic.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republicans Insists on Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego, August 12 (Xinhua)-- The U.S. Republicans today
insisted to develop and deploy nation-wide anti-missile systems
despite repeated rejections of their calls by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to deploy land-based and sea-based theater
missile defense as soon as possible, and a national system
thereafter," according to a Republican platform for the
presidential campaign passed here today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2000 Republican delegates from across the United States
started a four-day convention in this Western U.S. harbor city to
nominate the party's candidate for the White House. The 94-page
platform entitled "Restoring the American Dream" calls for a
supply-side tax-cut economic plan and the restoration of American
world leadership.
</P>
<P>
The document criticized U.S. President Bill Clinton for
slashing the funding budgeted by the last two Republican
administrations for building the nation-wide missile system.
</P>
<P>
"America will be increasingly threatened by long-range ballistic
missiles in the future," the platform said. "We therefor endorse
the Defend America Act of 1996, introduced by (former U.S.
Senator) Bob Dole which calls for a national missile system for
all fifty States by the year of 2003," it added.
</P>
<P>
The platform stressed that the danger of a missile attack with
nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons "is the most serious
threat" to the U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
But the Clinton administration has said that at least in ten to
fifteen years the United States would not face the danger of being
attacked by ballistic missiles of foreign nations.
</P>
<P>
It also warned that the Republican plan for the deployment of
the nation-wide anti-ballistic missile system violates the 1973
U.S.-Russia Anti-Ballistic Treaty.

<HEADLINE> UN Hopes People in Cyprus May Start Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations hoped
that the violence which erupted between Greek and Turkish Cypriots
on Sunday might bring people quickly to their senses and they
might take the advantage of this tragedy to sit down and start
talks, according to a U.N. spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the incident in the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in
which a Greek Cypriot was killed and more than 70 people on both
sides were injured, Spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said that it was not
the task of the United Nations to control demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. limited resources were stretched to the fullest on
Sunday as hundreds of Greek Cypriot motorcyclists defied an order
by authorities and pushed across the U.N.-patrolled line, clashing
with Turkish troops and Turkish Cypriot counter-demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
She noted that some of the demonstrators were armed and they
entered the U.N. buffer zone in several areas at the same time.
</P>
<P>
"This responsibility belongs to the authorities on the island,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP),
which was established by the Security Council in March 1964, was
present to make sure that the two sides stay apart, she said.
</P>
<P>
"When you have huge groups of people, -- despite pleas from the
government, despite a plea from the Secretary-General, despite
everybody knowing that such an action could lead to tragedy -- and
these guys go ahead and go after each other with rocks and sticks
and pipes and God only knows what else," she said.
</P>
<P>
UNFICYP was pursuing its investigation of the clashes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. concerned over Iran-turkey Fuel Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department,
showing its regret over a $20-billion fuel deal between turkey and
Iran, said on Monday that the pact send the "wrong message".
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Turkish Prime minister Necmettin Erbakan
struck the 22-year gas supply agreement with Iran in Tehran, under
which Iran will sell 140 billion cubic feet of gas a year to
Turkey, which poses a direct challenge to U.S. attempts to further
isolate Iran.
</P>
<P>
State Department Spokesman Glyn Davies said: "Our general
reaction is that we believe that this deal's conclusion sends the
wrong message to Iran."
</P>
<P>
But the Turkish prime minister, who left for Pakistan after
signing the agreement, claimed that it did not violate the new
U.S. law, which imposes sanctions on any foreign firms investing
more than $40 million a year in the energy section of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Davis admitted that the United States did not know all aspects
of the agreement. But the United States will "evaluate whether the
provisions of the Iran/Libya Sanctions Act will be brought into
play" when the details of the Iran-Turkey pact is available, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Davis said that despite Washington's concern, the United States
"certainly don't expect that this will cause a major rift in our
relationship".
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a NATO ally, has strong ties with the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 soldiers, airmen
and other military specialists are heading to the Persian Gulf to
take part in land, sea and air exercises in a way to show off U.S.
military power in the region.
</P>
<P>

The exercises include:
</P>
<P>
1, "Intrinsic Action 96-3", in which 1,200 army soldiers from
Fort McPherson, Georgia, and Fort Hood, Texas, rush to the former
battlefields of Kuwait to show how quickly they can deploy the
armored tanks and weaponry stored there.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, one of a series of maneuvers conducted by U.S.
troops since Saddam Hussein's forces were driven from Kuwait
during the 1991 Gulf war, began over the weekend and will last
through December.

<P>
Iran has said such exercises are "provocative acts", and
claimed last week that U.S. warplanes violated its air space twice
during the ongoing activities, but Washington denied the
complaints.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Allow IFOR Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb authority
today agreed to allow the IFOR troops to inspect a Serb military
site near Han Pijesak, a move to ease tension between the Serbs
and IFOR.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a meeting between Serb acting
President Biljana Plavsic and NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
in Serb stronghold Pale, said Peter Feith, political adviser to
the IFOR commander.
</P>
<P>
Solana arrived in Sarajevo earlier today with NATO supreme
allied commander, General George Joulwan, to urge the local
parties to create conditions for the upcoming elections in the
country.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Solana told reporters that the IFOR will
inspect the Serb arms site in Han Pijesak within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb soldiers blocked the IFOR troops on Saturday while
the latter were trying to inspect a military site in Han Pijesak,
the headquarters of the Serb army, thus causing tension between
the Serbs and the IFOR.
</P>
<P>
As part of its pressure, NATO evacuated its liaison officer in
Pale and threatened to resort to military action to show their
displeasure. On Monday, NATO banned all Bosnian Serb helicopter
over Bosnia until the inspection issue was resolved.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authority and IFOR representatives also reached an
agreement today on the reopening of the IFOR office in Pale,
Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic expressed satisfaction with the reached agreement and
reiterated that the Serbs were ready to fully implement the Dayton
agreement, Tanjug said.
