government and rebel factions which are involved in a civil war,
President Nelson Mandela announced in Cape Town today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting could occur as early as Thursday, Mandela told
reporters, after an African crisis summit attended by presidents
of Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique and Uganda, a report reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said a Zairean government representative is already in
South Africa and that rebel leader Laurent-desire Kabila is in
the Rwandan capital Kigali ready to come here.

South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki is making the
necessary arrangements for the proposed meeting, Mandela noted.

crisis in the region.
</P>

<HEADLINE> PLO Faction Turns to Support Peace Process With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A radical PLO faction has
decided to halt opposition to the peace process with Israel,
according to the Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem
today.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Front for Liberation of Palestine (DFLP)
announced its decision through a political initiative at a press
conference held in Ramallah, West Bank, this morning, a JMCC
report said.
</P>
<P>
DFLP said in the initiative that issues concerning permanent
status in the peace process are very decisive and should not be
dealt with by one Palestinian faction alone, adding a popular and
national unanimity is needed.
</P>
<P>
Tayseer Khaled, DFLP Politburo and PLO Executive Committee
member, explained at the press conference that DFLP's political
initiative has come amidst difficult conditions of the
Palestinian people and national struggle in light of the
increasing activities of Jewish settlement in the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Secretary of the Palestinian Cabinet Tayeb Abdel
Rahim said the Palestinian National Authority had received a phone
from the Damascus-based DFLP asserting that it will participate in
the forthcoming meeting of national dialog. President Yasser
Arafat will chair the meeting to be held in Nablus, West Bank, on
February 26, Rahim said.
</P>
<P>
Rahim said that the meeting is aimed at coordinating efforts
for "achieving the national goal of establishing an independent
Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
Khaled pointed out that any national dialog should be held in a
"serious and very responsible" way and no political maneuvers
should be allowed.
</P>
<P>
DFLP, founded in 1969, is a member of the PLO. It joined other
nine Palestinian groups in opposing the Oslo agreement the
Arafat-led PLO mainstream signed with Israel in 1993 and has
boycotted PLO activities ever since.

<HEADLINE> France Appeals for Stop of Fighting in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed its hope
that the international initiatives aimed at bringing about an
ending of the hostilities in Zaire will be followed by the two
belligerent sides of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of several European countries and the United
States in charge of African affairs stressed in Paris on Tuesday
the "emergency need for an ending of hostilities and the
withdrawal of all foreign forces" from Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly hope that these convergent efforts will rapidly
bring about their fruits," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman
Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council also made a five-point plan
on Zaire asking for "the immediate ending of hostilities" in
eastern Zaire and the "withdrawal of exterior forces, including
mercenaries."
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry spokesman said that the convergence of
views between Europeans and Americans showed that the "past
differences (over Zaire) have been overcome" by Washington and
Paris.
</P>
<P>
He said that European and American officials meeting in Paris
on Tuesday also expressed their support to the diplomatic mission
of the United Nations envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mohamed
Sahnoun.
</P>
<P>
"All the participants (of the meeting) have reaffirmed without
ambiguity their attachment to the principles which should guide
the action of the international community to help Zaire return to
peace and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kinshasa said that Zairean government forces are
continuing to exert pressure on the rebels today, after air
raiding rebel positions in eastern Zaire for two consecutive days
Monday and Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> UK Public Finances Show Sharp Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The British Government raised
5.8 billion pounds (9.28 billion US dollars) more in tax revenues
than it spent last month, showing it is on track to meet its
public borrowing target for this year.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that
Britain's repayment last month was the largest monthly total since
the height of the boom in January 1989.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that soaring VAT receipts and a healthy inflow
of corporation tax payments were the main factors behind the
improvement.
</P>
<P>
The performance put borrowing in the first ten months of the
1996-97 financial year at 10.3 billion pounds (16.48 billion US
dollars) compared to 19.3 billion pounds (30.88 billion US
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury has forecast a public borrowing requirement of
26.4 billion pounds (42.24 billion US dollars) for the year to the
end of March 1997, which should be comfortably achieved in the
light of the latest figures.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, welcomed the figures, saying
"This has been an excellent month for the public finances. the
figures are further confirmation that borrowing is on a clear
downward path."
</P>
<P>
"It shows we are running a very successful economy that is
going to continue to do well for many years to come," he added.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that the improvement of the
repayment gives the Tory government a remarkably strong economic
platform on which to fight the General Election, which now looks
certain to be held on May 1.
</P>
<P>
However, one economist in an accountancy firm said: "It is far
too soon to say we are out of the woods on the public finances.
Whoever is the next chancellor will have to raise taxes."

<HEADLINE> Strength of U.S. Dollar to Continue, Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The overvaluation of the U.S.
dollar will continue into 1998, according to a research group in
New York.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen will reach a low of 125 against the dollar in
the second quarter as the magnitude of Japan's trade reversal
becomes apparent, the Conference Board reported today.
</P>
<P>
It also said its latest economic forecast calls for the
Deutsche mark to fall to 1.75 by the end of 1997 and even further
in 1998 because of the turmoil surrounding the launch of the Euro.
The mark's relative weakness against the dollar will approximate
that of the yen, which could reduce the mark by as much as 20
percent to 1.85 level in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board research shows that the dollar tends to
become substantially overvalued before a correction occurs. In
the current case, the yen has reached a level that is more
undervalued relative to the dollar as it was overvalued in early
1995. As a consequence, it said, dollar decline is likely to occur
first against the yen. But the dollar rate appears to be headed
for still greater strength against the mark.

BRUSSELS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament has

<HEADLINE> New Resettlement Program Launched in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Local Government,
Rural and Urban Development Minister John Nkomo today said his
ministry will from now on concentrate on the resettlement of the
landless and those in congested communal areas.
</P>
<P>
Officially launching the new resettlement policy in Zimbabwe,
Nkomo said commercial farming-oriented Zimbabweans would be
catered for under the Ministry of Lands and Water Resources' land
distribution and indigenization programs.
</P>
<P>
He said the program would also provide an administrative
system for the social management of the new settlers and reduce
squatting and other disorderly settlements in both urban and
rural environments.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo said resettlement schemes would remain on state land
since they were implemented by the government for the benefit of
the generality of Zimbabwe's disadvantaged rural majority.
</P>
<P>
Each settler family would have a registration certificate for
arable and residential use while the registration certificate for
grazing and other common uses would be held in trust by the
village head, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The police were officially launched in the presence of the
country's eight provincial governors, chiefs, members of
parliament, representatives of farming organizations, the War
Veterans Association and provincial development committees.
</P>
<P>
The government needs at least 100 million U.S. Dollars a year
over the next 10 years to buy enough land to resettle some 92,000
landless families, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has since independence in 1980 acquired a total
of 3.4 million hectares which have benefited over 70,000
families.

<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Up to Highest Level in 8 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. foreign trade deficit
surged to 114.2 billion dollars last year, the highest level in
eight years, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that the deficit in goods and
services for all of 1996 was up by 8.7 percent from an imbalance
of 105.1 billion dollars in 1995. In December alone, the deficit
jumped 29.6 percent to 10.3 billion dollars, the worst showing
since September.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade deficit with Japan declined to 47.7 billion dollars
in 1996, a decrease of 19 percent from the 1995 figure and also
the second year of decline in a row. It was the smallest gap since
1991.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade deficit with Mexico increased to a record high of
16.2 billion dollars last year, up by 5.3 percent from 1995. The
U.S. government said the rising deficit with Mexico resulted from
the severe economic troubles triggered by the devaluation of the
currency in Mexico in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
For the year of 1996, the 114.2 billion-dollar deficit in U.S.
was the largest imbalance since a trade gap of 115.5 billion
dollars in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Total U.S. exports of goods climbed by 6.2 percent to a record
611.7 billion dollars last year. But imports of goods also surged
by 6.6 percent to a record 799.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in goods reached to an all-time high 187.6 billion
dollars last year. However, it was offset by a record surplus in
services which hit 73.4 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The record-high trade deficit in U.S. resulted mainly from the
increasing imports of crude oil which rose by 18.1 percent in 1996
to 50.6 billion dollars, reflecting higher oil prices.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade deficit stood at 38.8 billion dollars in 1992 and
has risen every year that President Clinton has been in office.
</P>
<P>
The administration said that the continued increase in U.S.
exports shows that efforts to break down foreign barriers is
working. It blames the overall deficit on broader economic forces
such as the disparity between America's higher economic growth and
the sluggish performances of many of its major trading partners.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM: Current Guarantee System Ineffective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government
believes the current system of guarantees of the independence
and integrity of Cyprus, as defined in the 1960 Treaty of
Guarantee, is not effective, Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides
said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in reply to comments made earlier today by
British High commissioner in Cyprus David Madden, who said
Britain wishes to maintain its status in relation to Cyprus (as a
guarantor power), enshrined in the Treaty of Guarantee.
</P>
<P>
Madden also indicated that his government would favor the
maintenance of the treaty and is ready to contribute to a
process of reconciliating the security needs of both the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
"We are now talking about the demilitarization of Cyprus and
the deployment of a multinational force on the island,"
Michaelides said.
</P>
<P>
The guarantee, which Ankara interprets as giving it the
unilateral right of military intervention, cannot be effective,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The 1960 Treaty of Guarantee stipulates that Greece, Turkey
and Britain undertake to guarantee the independence, territorial
integrity and security of the Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
It also provides that in the event of any breach of the
provisions of the treaty, all three undertake "to consult
together to ensure observance of those provisions."
</P>
<P>
"In so far as common or concerted action may prove
impossible, each of the three guaranteeing powers reserves the
right to take action with the sole aim of re-establishing the
state of affairs established by the present treaty," it says.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, citing this article, claimed it had the right to
intervene militarily in Cyprus in 1974 when a military coup
staged by the Junta ruling Greece at the time in an attempt to
topple the legally elected government of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Some 35,000 Turkish troops have been stationed at the
island's northern areas since 1974.

<HEADLINE> Large Amount of Contraband Cigarettes Seized in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Greek customs officers have
seized over one million packets of contraband cigarettes and 2,200
shirts on a Honduras-flagged vessel in the northern Greek port of
Nea Moudania in Chalkidiki.
</P>
<P>
According to the police today, the contraband cigarettes, which
was discovered in four containers on the freighter "dig", would
have been liable to duty totaling 1 billion drachmas (about 4
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The captain of the vessel, Ukrainian Volodimir Kosevcuk, 56,
was arrested.
</P>
<P>
He told customs officers that the cargo had been loaded in
Limassol, Cyprus and their destination was Nea Moudania.
</P>
<P>
The vessel arrived in the Greek port Tuesday morning without
reporting to the local harbor police office and without
presenting shipping documents for the cargo.
</P>
<P>
Customs officers searched the vessel and found 1,325,000
packets of cigarettes, Greek and foreign, packed in cartons of 50,
and the shirts of unknown origin.
</P>
<P>
Kosevcuk is due to appear in court at local court in Chalkidiki
later today.

PARIS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Algerian government will offer
100,000 to 450,000 francs (20,000 to 90,000 U.S. dollars) of bonus
for providing information which will help "the arrest or
elimination of the chief terrorists," according to a report by

</P>
<P>
He said that the terrorists have been defeated and their effort
to overthrow the state institutions foiled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Algerian parliament, the Conseil National de
Transition, adopted on Tuesday a new law on the creation of

<HEADLINE> IBRD Promises Egypt Insurance for Joint Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- An elite international
investment guarantee institution will provide insurance coverage
for foreign joint projects operating in and outside Egypt, said a
senior Egyptian trade official today.
</P>
<P>
The International Investment Guarantees Agency, an affiliate of
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
made the offer recently.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Fawzy, Chairman of the Executive Agency of the General
Investment Authority in Egypt, told the Egyptian MENA news
agency that the coverage will be limited to non-commercial ones,
such as medical and social insurances.
</P>
<P>
He said the coverage provided by the IBRD agency for Egyptian
ventures abroad will help Egyptian investors benefit from the same
facilities offered to the African states, especially raw
materials, tools, and other production necessities.
</P>
<P>
The agency also agreed to promote investments in Egypt via its
huge information network, said Fawzy.
</P>
<P>
It also agreed to consider Egypt's request to attend some of
the conferences organized by the agency in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The International Investment Guarantees Agency was founded in
1988. Its investments top 15 billion U.S. dollars and it extends
data and aid to over 90 countries.

<HEADLINE> Canada Beefs Up Flight Checks for Illegal Entrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian immigration officials
have started to board international flights arriving in the
country every day in a bid to catch illegal entrants.
</P>
<P>
The officials, along with customs and the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, are also trying to link airlines to passengers
traveling without legitimate papers, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Immigration used to do spot checks every week of flights
arriving in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
However, a decision was made last October to step up the effort
in light of increased passengers arriving without documents,
according to Immigration Department spokeswoman Paula Bennett.
</P>
<P>
Now, a six-member team boards a plane as it lands and asks all
passengers to produce their passports. Suspicious ones are
thoroughly screened.
</P>
<P>
The team can check a Boeing 747 with 400 people aboard in 10
minutes, and there is little inconvenience to passengers, the
spokeswoman noted.
</P>
<P>
The on-board checks give immigration officials more data on
those smuggling people into Canada, and on the airlines that are
allowing such people to travel, she said.
</P>
<P>
Without the checks, passengers with false documents usually
destroy them or pass them back on to the smuggler or his contact.
</P>
<P>
They also refuse to tell immigration officials in the terminal
which carrier brought them to Canada.
</P>
<P>
An airline must pay a fine of about 2,370 U.S. dollars for each
person that boards a plane without legitimate documents, even if
the person is accepted in the end as a refugee in Canada.
</P>
<P>
And if the person is denied refugee status, the airline is
responsible for paying his or her return fare to the country where
the flight originated, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, she did not give a figure of how many illegal entrants
have been caught under current program.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Prices Up 0.1 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices in the U.S.
increased by 0.1 percent in January as declining fruit and other
food prices helped offset an increase in energy costs, the U.S.
Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that energy prices in U.S. rose by 0.8
percent in January, the fifth consecutive monthly gain. That was
propelled by a 4.8 percent increase in natural gas prices, the
steepest increase since the department began keeping track in
1952. U.S. natural gas prices have increased by 15.9 percent over
10 months.
</P>
<P>
However, food prices slipped by 0.3 percent, the largest
decline in three and an half years. The seasonally adjusted price
of fresh fruit fell 5.3 percent, the biggest drop in more than
four years.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the so-called
core-rate prices also increased by 0.1 percent, the best showing
in five months.
</P>
<P>
Last year, U.S. consumer prices by rose 3.3 percent, the
biggest increase in six years, pushed up by higher food and energy
costs. But, excluding food and energy, the underlying inflation
rate was 2.6 percent, the best in 31 years.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economists are looking for overall inflation to ease and
the core rate to edge higher as crude oil prices are starting to
decline. That would make 1997 the seventh consecutive year with
inflation of around 3 percent in the country.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Promises to Approve E. Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today promised that he would approve a
controversial building project in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the promise during his meetings with coalition
and opposition lawmakers in his office in the Knesset
(Parliament), the Prime Minister's Office announced.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was apparently trying to ease the mounting pressure
on him from within the coalition to go ahead immediately the
building project in Har Homa neighborhood in southeastern
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He promised that a decision on the timing of beginning Har
Homa building project would be made at another meeting of the
Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem Affairs next week. In the
first such meeting Tuesday, Netanyahu approved plans of building
two new roads in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
To calm the anger of the Palestinians, Netanyahu at the same
time pledged that he would also build houses for Arab residents
in part of Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
Under the original plan, which was favored but not carried
out by the previous Labor government, 6,500 housing units were
planned in the area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of right-wing coalition lawmakers continued
pressuring Netanyahu on the Har Homa issue. They toured the Har
Homa site today and warned of toppling the government if
Netanyahu rejected their request.
</P>
<P>
"This depends on Mr. Netanyahu. We will give him a security
bail if he build in Har Homa. If he doesn't fulfill his ideology,
this is a problem," Gesher's lawmaker Michael Kleiner said.
</P>
<P>
There are fears that the Har Homa project could spark new
Palestinian violence similar to the bloodshed last September
caused by Israel's opening of an eastern Jerusalem underground
tunnel. About 75 people were killed in the three-day widespread
clashes.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have repeatedly warned of dire
consquences of the Har Homa project, while Israeli security
service also cautioned the government against going ahead with
the plan.
</P>
<P>
Fearing the recent events could endanger the peace process
that has just been back on track since the Hebron deal, the
U.S. State Department criticized Tuesday Israel's decision of
building in eastern Jerusalem and called for caution.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem has been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian
disputes. While Israel has declared Jerusalem as its eternal and
indivisible capital, the Palestinians want eastern Jerusalem,
captured by Israel in the 1967 War, to be the capital of a
future Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> PNA: Trade Taken Hostage by Israeli Border Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) senior official said today the Palestinian-Egyptian trade
has become hostage of the prolonged Israeli security closures on
the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel's security checks have created many obstacles for the
transfer of Egyptian goods to the Palestinian self-rule areas, PNA
Minister of Economic Cooperation Nabil Shaath said after a meeting
with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Israel sealed off the Gaza Strip and West Bank in the wake of
violent attacks by Palestinian extremists since a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"We can get one billion U.S. dollars worth of Egyptian goods
the next day once the Israeli authorities lift the ban imposed on
the Palestinian borders," said the Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians import 2.7 billion dollars worth of goods from
Israel annually, while they only imported 50 million dollars of
commodities from Egypt last year.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian markets have become captives of Israel's
hegemony," he added.
</P>
<P>
Shaath, together with Egyptian Minister of Economy and
International Economy Nawal al-Tatawy, is co-chairman of the
ongoing session of the Egyptian-Palestinian Trade Cooperation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Shaath expressed the hope that the joint committee would double
the volume of Palestine's imports from Egypt to 100 million
dollars within the coming six months and one billion dollars
annually over the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between Egypt and the PNA should go beyond the
level of trade to joint investments and establishing free zone, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Palestinian Trade Committee, which convened here
Tuesday, is expected to announce their recommendations for
facilitating two-way trade flows in the final session tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Under scrutiny are granting preferential treatment to exports
between the two sides, eliminating administrative barriers to good
exchange and creating a cross-border free zone to encourage
investments.
</P>
<P>
The committee meets every year since its first session in April
1995 within the framework of an agreement on economic and
technical cooperation signed on January 25, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The trade committee is responsible for setting up branches for
the Egyptian financial institutions and banks in the West Bank and
Gaza and encouraging trade and investment between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have said that restrictions on Palestinian
laborers in Israel cost their economy 6 million dollars a day and
have driven up the unemployment rates, which stand at 40 percent in
Gaza and 30 percent in the West Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Bill Richardson, the
new permanent representative of the United States to the United
Nations, said on Tuesday that there is a new era between the
United Nations and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks to reporters after presenting his

</P>
<P>
"My message is one of paying our arrears, reform, but also to
say that U.N. is important to the United States," he said, adding
that he is going to travel around the country, explaining the
importance of the world organization.
</P>
<P>
Saying that there is a new era of cooperation between the
Clinton Administration and the Congress in the United Nations,
Richardson pledged support for Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"Kofi Annan has been a reformer," he said. "We intend to
support him. We're interested in quick reform. But at the same
time we are interested in assuring that U.S. pays its arrears.
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be difficult negotiation with the congress. But
I think we will prevail."
</P>
<P>
Prior to this appointment, Richardson was a congressman
representing New Mexico's Third Congressional District, from 1982
to 1996. During that time he also served as a special envoy to
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 he met with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and
negotiated the release of two imprisoned Americans. A year
earlier, two U.S. pilots were freed by the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea due to Mr. Rechardson's efforts.

</P>
<P>
Paulo Matos, the head of the Angolan Electricity Company, said

In the first stage of the 20-year implementation of the plan
from 1997 to 2001, 400 million Dollars would be spent on
restoring those war-damaged power facilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Between 2001 and 2016, the plan would focus on building new

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for Emergency Humanitarian Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
appealed on Tuesday for 120.8 million U.S. dollars to meet the
emergency humanitarian needs of the war-affected and displaced
persons in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the United Nations said that
persistent insecurity combined with natural disasters, including
crop failures and floods in the Sudan, have worsened the plight of
almost all vulnerable groups who are already living below
subsistence levels.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 4.2 million people will require assistance in
the form of medical and health care, basic education, emergency
shelter, as well as agriculture, livestock and fishing inputs.
</P>
<P>
To meet the emergency needs of vulnerable groups including
630,000 children under the age of five, the United Nations is
appealing for 120.8 million U.S. dollars to fund 33 projects
during 1997.
</P>
<P>
The largest request is from the United Nations Children's Fund
which requires more than 46 million U.S. dollars to help improve
the health, nutrition and overall household food security of the
war's main victims -- women, children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Most emergency assistance to the Sudan is channeled through
Operation Lifeline Sudan under which seven United Nations
agencies and more than 50 non-governmental organizations operate
to bring assistance to war-affected displaced camps and
settlement areas around Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
The Operation works in close partnership with all the parties
to the conflict including the government of Sudan and the southern
movements.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Urged to Curb Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Consumer Council of
Zimbabwe (CCZ) today said the latest price increase needs urgent
government intervention or it will plunge consumers into poverty.
</P>
<P>
CCZ Managing Director Muchaneta Nyambuya said his organization
believes that the 10 percent price rise of maize-meal and other
essential goods were excessive and not justified for Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the prices of beef, milk and soft drinks
will rise respectively by 22, 10.2 and 15 percent before the
end of February in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rural bus fares were also expected to rise by 15.5
percent around the country.
</P>
<P>
"It appears the business sector is wrongly adopting the
'Consumer Pay Principle' whereby consumers are made to pay
through the nose for the inefficiences and mismanagement of firms
and local authorities," Nyambuya said.
</P>
<P>
"At CCZ, our position is that the business community must not
always resort to blind price increases hoping to increase their
revenue base," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted it is the government's obligation to adopt measures
such as reintroducing subsidies on basic goods and services to
guarantee consumers' rights. enditem

UNITED NATIONS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan brought to the attention of the Security Council a
five-point peace plan by his special envoy to the Great Lakes

<P>
In a letter to the council president Njuguna M. Mahugu of

Unity Special Representative for the Great Lakes region, Mohammed
Sahnoun, is working on a five-point peace plan:
</P>
<P>
1) immediate cessation of hostilities;
</P>
<P>
2) withdrawal of all external forces, including mercenaries;
</P>
<P>
3) reaffirmation of respect for the national sovereignty and
the territorial integrity of Zaire and other states of the Great
Lakes region;
</P>
<P>
4) protection and security for all refugees and displaced
persons and facilitation of access to humanitarian assistance;
</P>
<P>
5) rapid and peaceful settlement of the crisis through
dialogue, the electoral process and the convening of an
international conference on peace, security and development in
the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
"It would greatly assist the efforts of the joint United
Nations/Organization of African Unity Special Representative if
consideration were to be given by the Security Council, on an
urgent basis, to an appropriate acknowledgment and support of his
initiative," said Annan in the letter.

David Levy today called on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
release an Israeli citizen charged with espionage in Egypt,
reported the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli citizen, Azam Azam, was formally charged with
spying for Israel Monday. Israel maintains that the man,
an engineer and member of Arab Druse community in Israel, is
entirely innocent.
</P>
<P>
Appearing before the Knesset (parliament) Interior Committee,
Levy called on the U.S. to intervene with Egypt to help secure
the release of the Israeli Arab. He said he will also approach
other countries for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
The committee demanded that the government recall Israel's
ambassador for consultations and make it clear that the incident
could sour bilateral ties and damage the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry today also summoned Egyptian Ambassador
Mohammed Bassiouni to express anger at Egypt's decision to
prosecute Azam on spy charge.
</P>
<P>
During his last visit to Cairo, Levy personally asked

<HEADLINE> Turkish Deputy PM Survives Corruption Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller today averted another possible
trial in the Supreme Court again after the Parliament rejected
three corruption reports against the female politician.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday and Tuesday, the Parliament voted 270 to 263, 327
to 172 and 271 to 257 against the opposition's attempts to bring
Ciller to a Supreme Court trial.
</P>
<P>
Ciller has been accused of committing irregularities in the
privatization of TEDAS company and in the sale of the
state-owned TOFAS car company shares.
</P>
<P>
She is also accused of acquiring "funds of an uncertain
origin" as part of her millions dollars worth of personal assets.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that Ciller was once again rescued by the
alliance of senior coalition Welfare Party (RP) led by Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan and her own True Path Party (DYP).
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the corruption motion againt Ciller was first put
forward by the RP when it was in the opposition.
</P>
<P>
After the RP-DYP coalition was set up, the RP took a U-turn on
the issue and joined hands with the DYP to block the adoption of
the motion by the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
All the three parliamentary reports cleared Ciller of the
corruption charges as a result of the dominance of the coalition
deputies in the inquiry commissions, making the opposition very
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
Although the RP-DYP alliance, with 279 seats in the
parliament, still has a slim majority, it has shown somewhat
shaky with the defection of some coalition deputies.
</P>
<P>
Mehmet Korkmaz, a deputy of the DYP, announced his withdrawal
from his party on Tuesday, regarded as a fresh blow on
Ciller.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today expressed strong opposition to
making European Union (EU) a superstate, which he said "would be a
nightmare for Britain".
</P>
<P>
He said this in a speech delivered at the Konrad Adenauer
Foundation in Bonn, while reiterating that Britain has always
expected EU to be a framework for working together "in a close but
decentralized partnership".
</P>
<P>
Rifkind also told reporters that London's position on the
single European currency, the euro, remained unchanged, and that
the government would decide whether to join the single currency
union or not at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
London was not concerned about a possible delay to the euro's
start-up, he added.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is unlikely that currency union will begin on
time," he said in an interview with Germany's the Bild tabloid
daily.
</P>
<P>
The euro is due to be launched from January 1, 1999, if EU
states would meet the admission criteria including limits on
public debt and budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation which is
linked to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU), Rifkind also criticized most proposals Bonn offered
to EU's reform Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) as aiming at
creating a highly centralized European state.

He also headed several delegations to Moscow for negotiations
with the Soviet Communist Party, during which he firmly
safeguarded the principle of independence of the CPC, and opposed
any inequality in party-to-party relations. During the "Cultural
Revolution" period, he was wrongfully criticized and persecuted,
and stripped of all official posts.
</P>
<P>
In 1973 he was rehabilitated, and in 1975 became vice chairman
of the CPC Central Committee, vice premier of the State Council,
vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, and chief of the
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, taking
charge of the day-to-day affairs of the Party, the state, and the
military.
</P>
<P>
He made vigorous efforts to turn the tide, introdued bold
rectification measures to change the difficult situation China
faced as a result of the "Cultural Revolution", and waged a
tit-for-tat struggle against the Gang of Four.
</P>
<P>
This kind of rectification and struggle reflected the
aspirations of the cadres and the general public, stood for the
Party's correct leadership, and won warm support throughout the
country for achieving marked results within a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
Though he was soon wrongfully stripped of all official posts
again, his efforts laid a broad mass foundation within the Party
and without for the crushing of the Gang of Four.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Doctors Popular in Sao Tome &AMP; </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- In Sao Tome &AMP; Principe, an
island state in the Atlantic Ocean, a group of Chinese doctors
are popular for their high medical skills and strong sense of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Chinese medical team arrived in the beautiful
country late last July and started working in the only national
hospital Sao Tome Center early last August. By the end of last
year, it had received 10,773 out-patients, 3,019 in-patients,
2,710 emergency calls, and performed 1,928 operations.
</P>
<P>
In the five-month period, they also treated 560 critical
patients, among whom 509 were saved from death. More than 90
percent of the in-patients were also cured by the Chinese
doctors.
</P>
<P>
However, it has not been easy for them to achieve such an
great success, because the country's serious economic
difficulties have also affected its hospitals, of course
including Sao Tome Center.
</P>
<P>
As the highest level hospital in the country, the center has
18 departments and a staff of about 200. It is also the only
hospital which has surgeons and provides surgical services in the
country. In its surgical department, only one doctor is a Korean,
while the others are all from China.
</P>
<P>
Even in the only national hospital, shortage of medicine and
medical appliance is very common. Even spirits are in short
supply, let alone wonder drugs and sophisticated equipment.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese medical team has braved the difficulties and
tried their best to serve the local people and remove their pains
and diseases.
</P>
<P>
It is under such poor working conditions that the Chinese
doctors have made wonders.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after they arrived in the country last year, the
Chinese doctors received a 22-year-old patient named Trindade Da
Mata, whose arteria femoralis in his leg was broken in an
industrial accident, with blood streaming down.
</P>
<P>
In such a case, the Chinese doctors had only two options: to
perform an amputation operation or to transplant a vein for
Trindade da Mata.
</P>
<P>
To perform such an major operation of vein transplanting, the
doctors would take very high risks because the center has no
blood, no microscope and other necessary appliances.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese doctors opted the latter choice out of
consideration for the patient, without considering any risks they
would take.
</P>
<P>
After undergoing the operation and a three-month treatment and
nursing, the wounded leg of Da Mata was saved and recovered.
</P>
<P>
Just on the day he was discharged from hospital after
recovery, he was so excited that he wrote a letter of thanks to
Chinese Ambassador Zuo Shusen based in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, he expressed his boundless gratitude to the
Chinese doctors for their wonderful art of healing and strong
sense of responsibility and hoped that the ambassador would
convey his thanks to the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The serious economic difficulties and bad living conditions
have scared off other foreign doctors whose number has fallen
from 20 to six in the hospital, but never the Chinese doctors.
</P>
<P>
After diplomatic relations was established between China and
Sao Tome &AMP; Principe in 1975, the first Chinese medical team was
assigned to the west African country in the following year.
</P>
<P>
So far, 11 medical teams from Sichuan Province have been sent
to the country by the Chinese government consecutively in the
past more than two decades. And more than 100 Chinese doctors
have watered the tree of bilateral friendship with their blood
and sweat.
</P>
<P>
However, the reduction of other foreign doctors in the
hospital has added burden to the Chinese doctors.
</P>
<P>
In some departments such as the departments of general
surgery, urology and ENT, only one Chinese doctor is left on
duty. A 55-year-old Chinese doctor in the department of general
surgery had once been on duty around the clock for five months.
</P>
<P>
Besides the heavy workload, the Chinese doctors are also
threatened by local diseases, such as malaria. In less than half
a year after they reached the country, more than half of the
Chinese doctors had suffered from malaria, and some of them
suffered from it more than once.
</P>
<P>
Yin Zhengshu, head of the medical team, was infected with
malignant malaria in less than two months in the country.
</P>
<P>
As she was in a critical condition and the medical facilities
are poor in Sao Tome &AMP; Principe, the Chinese Ministry of Health
and the Chinese Embassy agreed to send her back home for
treatment after her receiving initial treatment in Gabon.
</P>
<P>
But after her disease was controled, she returned from Gabon
to Sao Tome &AMP; Principe to continue to treat local people instead
of going back to China.
</P>
<P>
Such stories happening to these Chinese doctors cannot be
counted.
</P>
<P>
Their wonderful medical skills and strong sense of
responsibility have earned them popularity and love among local
patients. Most of the local patients have trust in Chinese doctors.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Minister of Health of Sao Tome &AMP; Principe Fernando
Silveira spoke highly of the contributions of the Chinese medical
teams to his country and its people, hoping to see bilateral
cooperation improved further.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government to Restart Administration in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government said
today it is to formally restart administration in areas
controlled by the opposition National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) from March 4.
</P>
<P>
Under a plan called "First Actions on Rebuilding National
Administration Branches Countrywide", which was issued today, the
government will restore its rule in Mbanza-Congo, the capital
city of Angola's northwestern Zaire Province.
</P>
<P>
The city is also the sole provincial capital seized by UNITA
since 1992 when war was escalated in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
Zaire Province's legal authorities, having been run in the oil
hub of Soyo of the province since a peace accord was signed by
warring parties in November, 1994, will move to Mbanza-Congo on
March 4 when a ceremony will be held, said the plan.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the government, UNITA, the U.N. Angolan
Verification Mission and the seven countries in charge of monitoring
Angola's peace process will arrive at the city on Saturday for
preparations.
</P>
<P>
The first group of pro-government policemen, accompanied by
the peacekeeping force, were scheduled to arrive there on
February 28, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The government said in the plan that the restoration of
national administration mainly aims to help local residents
have a normal life with access to water, electricity and other
necessary public services. enditem

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies Opposition of NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu
Ciller said here today that her country does not oppose the
expansion of NATO and European institutions.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, also the Turkish deputy premier, who returned from a
NATO meeting in Brussels, said that NATO, the European Union (EU)
as well as the Western European Union (WEU) should expand
together.
</P>
<P>
Ciller's remarks are believed to be an obvious revision of
Turkey's former position under the pressure of the United States
and NATO.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday in
Brussels that all the NATO members should remain united in face of
Russian propaganda offensive against the alliance enlargement,
adding NATO's expansion program should be respected by all its
member states.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana paid a one-day visit to
Ankara on February 6, but failed to persuade Turkish leaders to
drop its original stand linking NATO expansion with Turkey's EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to veto NATO's expansion plan if it
is not allowed to become a full member of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has made efforts for the full EU membership since 1987,
but it is still kept outside the European organization due to
some controversial issues.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Meets Croatian FM on Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic held talks with visiting Croatian Deputy Premier and
Foreign minister Mate Granic here today, with the main focus on
the Eastern Slavonia issue.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two sides stressed the importance of the
due implementation of the Erdut agreement, which should secure the
lasting normalization of the situation in the Eastern Slavonia
region, in particular conditions for the free and equal life of
all citizens in these lands and for the restoration of mutual
confidence, a government statement said.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonia, located in northeastern Croatia bordering
Yugoslavia, is the last area still controlled by the Serbs. Under
the Erdut agreement signed in November 1995, the region is under
the U.N. Transitional Administration until July this year.
</P>
<P>
General elections to be held in April in Croatia are stirring
uncertainty in the Serb-dominated area and some Serbs have begun
to flee into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic and Granic also expressed interest in the promotion
of Yugoslav-Croatian relations and the development of cooperation
between the two countries, the official Tanjug news agency quoted
the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, both sides agreed there was progress in
bilateral relations, in spite of obstacles and limiting factors,
primarily in the realization of dialogue which creates conditions
for resolving open issues, reaching agreement, and the speedier
establishment of ties in areas of common interest.
</P>
<P>
"In this respect, it is necessary to step up activities on the
implementation of the agreement on a normalization of relations,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The successful development of Yugoslav-Croatian relations and
the resolving of outstanding issues in the spirit of the mutually
expressed readiness to develop good-neighborly relations are in
the best interest not only of Yugoslavia, Croatia, but also in the
interest of cementing peace and stabilizing the political
situation in the region, it said.
</P>
<P>
Granic arrived here this morning for a one-day working visit at
the invitation of Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic.
Yugoslavia and Croatia, the two most powerful countries in the
Balkans, normalized relations in August 1996, easing tension in
the region.

<HEADLINE> Deng Xiaoping Passes Away-6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the Gang of Four was smashed and the "Cultural
Revolution" ended, he reassumed all the original posts under the
urgent demand of both the Party members and the people.
</P>
<P>
At that time, however, China faced a very serious situation and
extremely arduous tasks not only to shake off the grave disasters
caused by the "Cultural Revolution", but also need to sum up the
historical experience and lessons. Facing the development of the
world situation, China needed to reconsider the way of developing
its socialism, and to draw a new blueprint for its advancement in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping did not fail to live up to the expectations of
the Party and the people. From among a multitude of things, he
seized the key link by starting to bring the Party ideology and
line back onto the right track in the first place.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that seeking truth from facts is the essence of Mao
Zedong thought, Deng opposed the erroneous idea of
"two-Whatever's", that is, "we firmly uphold whatever policy
decisions Chairman Mao made, and we unswervingly adhere to
whatever instructions Chairman Mao gave." He supported the
discussions on the criterion for judging truth and reaffirmed the
ideology and political line of emancipating mind and seeking truth
from facts. The correction of the erroneous ideology and political
line became the guide to the third plenum of the 11th CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The plenum marked a great historical turn since the founding of
New China, and ushered in a new historical period of reform and
opening up and of concentrating forces on socialist modernization
construction. It was after this plenum that Comrade Deng Xiaoping
became the core of the second generation of the central
collective leadership.
</P>
<P>
In the new period, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, along with the
central collective leadership, made two major historic
contributions that have a vital bearing on the future and
fate of the Party and the country.
</P>
<P>
One of his contributions is to lead the whole Party to
summarize the historical experience since the founding of New
China, correct the mistakes of the "Cultural Revolution", and
adhere to a scientific understanding and evaluation of Comrade
Mao Zedong's historical status and the scientific system of Mao
Zedong thought.
</P>
<P>
The other contribution is to initiate and develop the theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, formulating the
Party's basic line of "one focus, two basic points" at the primary
stage of socialism, and outlining a whole set of principles and
policies for the Party in the fields of economy, politics,
diplomacy, education, science and technology, culture, military
affairs, reunification of the motherland, and Party building, thus
successfully developing a new way of achieving socialist
modernization through reforms and opening up.

country's outlook has undergone profound changes, winning
whole-hearted support from the people. This has covered efforts
from bringing order out of chaos to overall reform, from rural
reform to urban reform, from economic reform to reforms in various
sectors, from the establishment of special economic zones in
coastal areas to overall opening-up across the country, from
promoting material development and cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
Amid domestic and international political disturbances in late
1980s and early 1990s, the Party and government, with the staunch
and powerful support from comrade Deng Xiaoping and other
veterans, and relying on the people as well, maintained a
clear-cut stand on the Four Cardinal Principles, and safeguarded
the country's independence, dignity, security and stability, while
unswervingly taking economic growth as the central task, and
adhering to the reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the facts that the Party and government have kept a
firm and sober-minded position and that the achievements of
reform, opening-up and modernization drive have taken root in the
hearts of the people, we have stood severe tests, and the
socialism with Chinese characteristics has demonstrated even
greater vitality, which makes the Chinese people happy and
attracts the world's attention.

<HEADLINE> Germany Exports Torpedoes to Seven States Since 1980 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- German arms manufacturers
exported torpedoes to seven states between 1980 and 1996, said the
Bonn government today in reply to a question in parliament.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said Germany sold torpedoes to
Argentina, Chile, Greece, India and Peru between 1980 and 1988, to
Norway and South Korea during the period from 1989 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia purchased torpedo components over the 16 years.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not specify the volume or which exact type of
systems had been sold.
</P>
<P>
The government said it has no information about the sales to
Pakistan and Taiwan, and German law prohibits arms exports to
conflict regions.
</P>
<P>
Official data showed that German arms exports totaled nearly 2
billion marks (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Hinders Bonn From Meeting Budget Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Germany will
force the government to seek a further 20 billion mark (11.8
billion U.S. dollar) cuts in spending this year to meet the
criteria set for the launching of the single European currency,
the euro, a newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily Berliner Zeitung said that the number of jobless
people in January rose by 12.2 percent to a record 4.66 million,
and this would cost the state an extra 20 billion marks this year
to fund unemployment benefits.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, this would mean that the budget
deficits would soar to over 3.5 percent of the annual gross
domestic product (GDP), compared with the 2.9 percent officially
predicted, if without cuts.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU's Masstricht Treaty, a state must keep budget
deficits under 3 percent of GDP in order to join the single
currency union.
</P>
<P>
The euro is due to be launched on January 1, 1999. However,
countries will be selected to take part in early 1998 based on
full economic data from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government imposed a freeze on public spending last
March in an effort to meet the budget target, trimming 1996
federal spending by 1 percent to 456 billion marks (269 billion
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Radical Reform Proposed for Turkey's Coal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- In a radical reform, Turkey's
state-owned Turkish Coal Company proposed massive lay-offs in its
non-coal mining sectors, the Anatolia news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
A company report, which was presented to State Minister Teoman
Riza Guneri responsible for the mining industry, also suggested
that more mining workers be recruited to make the industry more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
The coal company now has a total of 21,000 employees, but 5,000
of whom work in the loss-making non-mining branches.
</P>
<P>
If approved, the company is expected to withdraw from all
non-coal mining sectors, including social services, construction,
road transportation and other technical fields.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that most employees in these sectors will be
fired, while about 4,000 workers are to be hired to work in the
coal mines.
</P>
<P>
The company's non-coal mining sectors have suffered a loss of
275 million U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report has also put forward the suggestions of
privatization and abolition of a number of small mines in a bid
to prevent the further increase of losses.

significantly shaped the course of Chinese history," Ong

by the Gang of Four in 1976. But his spirit and courage never
failed. he returned to Beijing and brought China to its present
progress with his Open Policy in 1978," Lee said.

JAKARTA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Good relations between
Indonesia and China would remain despite the death of China's

</P>

"Deng's death would not cause changes in the ongoing

<HEADLINE> Israel Worried About Alleged Involvement in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Health Minister
Yehoshua Matza expressed hope today that Israel's involvement
in a Federal Bureau of Intelligence (FBI) case would not affect
its relations with the United States, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Matza was referring to the current FBI investigation of a
U.S. engineer who admitted to inadvertently pass on classified
military information to Israeli liaison officers (ILOs) at a base in
Michigan, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The FBI is continuing the investigation, which has revolved
around statements made last week by David A. Tenenbaum, civilian
mechanical engineer, during a polygraph test he took to gain a
security clearance upgrade.
</P>
<P>
Tenenbaum is employed at the Tank Automotive Research and
Development Engineering Center of the U.S. Army Tank and
Armaments Command, in Warren, Michigan, said The Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
According to an affidavit filed in a U.S. district Court in
Detroit last Friday and publicized on the Internet edition of the
Detroit Free Press, which broke the story Wednesday, Tenenbaum
"admitted to divulging non-releasable classified information" to
Israeli liaison officers over the last ten years.
</P>
<P>
Tenenbaum further stated that he "inadvertently provided his
Israeli contacts, specifically to the ILOs and Dr. Reuven Granot,
scientific deputy director of the Israeli Ministry of Defense,
classified information from the three special access program
projects to which he had access."
</P>
<P>
A FBI spokesman in Detroit, Thomans Mailey, said Wednesday
that a "search warrant has been executed" by the bureau of
Tenenbaum's home in suburban Southfield (of the U.S.). However,
He emphasized that "no arrests have been made."
</P>
<P>
The Israel Radio said that Israeli defense establishment and
the Israeli embassy in Washington had held consultations on how to
respond to the matter.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Wednesday, the Israeli Defense Ministry said it
had not been asked for any details regarding the report. "The
defense establishment personnel in the United States
have clear and unequivocal instructions barring them from
receiving classified information unless it comes from proper
channels between the two countries and in an authorized and
agreed upon manner," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy spokesman Gadi Baltiansky said Wednesday that no
Israeli official has been approached by the U.S. authorities,
adding that if it comes to pass, "their request will be treated
in the spirit of full cooperation (and) we will check it out."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is a Pollard 2," Baltiansky said,
referring to Johnathan Pollard, U.S. Naval analyst, convicted of
spying for Israel and now serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, FBI Director Louis Freeh is currently in Israel
for an official visit. But the FBI investigation did not come up
in the meeting Wednesday between Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and Freeh, U.S. officials were quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Bans Anti-Personnel Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa announced
today the imposition of a comprehensive and immediate ban on
anti-personnel land mines while calling on other countries to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Joe Modise told reporters in Cape Town that
the government troops would destroy its stockpile of 160,000
mines, retaining only a limited number for training personnel in
de-mining techniques.
</P>
<P>
The ban on the use, development, production and stockpiling of
anti-personnel mines follows a 1996 ban on the export of all
forms of land mines.
</P>
<P>
The latest decision on banning anti-personnel mines was taken
at Wednesday's cabinet meeting, South African Press Association
(SAPA) said.
</P>
<P>
According to Modise, anti-personnel mines killed or maimed
some 2,000 people every month around the world, the vast majority
of them being civilians.
</P>
<P>
"This grave international problem can only be addressed by
concerted international action to restrict the availability and
use of land-mines," Modise noted.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said the South African government would
resolutely seek a complete ban on anti-personnel mines and would
do everything possible to encourage other governments and
international institutions to comply.
</P>
<P>
While South Africa is promising to destruct anti-personnel
mines, it still keeps a stockpile and research of anti-vehicle
land-mines which are said to be used for self-defense, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Some countries, including Scandinavian nations and Canada,
have banned the mines, but others such as Britain, France and the
United States are resisting.

<HEADLINE> Uzbek, Lithuanian Presidents Speak Highly of Deng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TASHKENT, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Uzbek President Islam Karimov
and his Lithuanian counterpart, Algirdas Brazauskas, spoke highly
here today of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Karimov told a press conference after his talks with the
visiting Lithuanian president that he was saddened at the passing
away of the Chinese leader in Beijing Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Deng was one of the greatest leaders of the world in the 20th
century, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Karimov said: "Deng Xiaoping drafted China's policies of reform
and opening up, under which the country has attracted 26 percent
of international investment and has gained splendid achievements
in economic development."
</P>
<P>
Deng has enabled the 1.2 billion Chinese people to be well-fed
and well-clothed and this is a great contribution to the
development of the human kind, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his trips to some Chinese cities including Shanghai,
the country's biggest city, the president said that he had seen
with his own eyes the achievements of China's economic development
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
Deng deserves the title as the chief architect and the helmsman
of China's economic reforms, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the same press conference, Brazauskas, who is on an
official visit to this central Asian nation, described Deng as a
great and intelligent statesman.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders from different countries whom I had met all spoke
highly of Deng's contributions to the economic development of
China," Brazauskas said.
</P>
<P>
Deng not only opened China's door to the outside world but also
made the rest of the world understand China, Brazauskas noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that Lithuania is willing to learn from Deng's mode of
economic reform and successful experience about the establishment
of special economic zones.
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas, who arrived here on Wednesday, held talks with
Karimov this morning on bilateral relations and economic
cooperation between Lithuania and Uzbekistan.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Year Expects 53 Million Overseas Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XISHUANGBANNA (Yunnan), February 20 (Xinhua) -- China expects
to have 53 million overseas tourists this year, the
director-general of the China National Tourism Administration
(CNTA) He Guangwei announced here today.
</P>
<P>
This will be the seventh straight year China's tourism industry
has maintained a rapid growth rate in the world tourism
market. Statistics show that the number of overseas tourists
reached 51.12 million last year, hitting a historic record.
</P>
<P>
Overseas tourism is expected to earn 11 billion US dollars in
foreign exchange for China in 1997, a rise from last year's 10.2
billion US dollars, which was also a new high.
</P>
<P>
In October of 1978, China's late leader Deng Xiaoping, who died
on Wednesday, set the goal of earning 10 billion US dollars from
overseas tourism annually. The CNTA later re-set the same target
for the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The CNTA predicts the number of overseas tourists from major
source countries will grow steadily.
</P>
<P>
The number of travelers from Japan, which sends the largest
amount of tourists to China, will be up ten to 15 percent this
year. The number of visitors from countries in southeast Asia will
increase by seven to eight percent.
</P>
<P>
North American countries will also witness a continuous
increase in the number of tourists to China. In Europe, Britain's
Chinese tourist growth rate will remain at about ten percent, and
that of other countries will also remain steady.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced the start of "Visit
China 97" during this year's Spring Festival celebration -- the
Chinese Lunar New Year, and the country's travel services,
airlines, and governments of different levels are going all out to
accommodate the tide of tourists.
</P>
<P>
China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1, and tourism officials predict more and more Hong Kong
tourists will come to visit the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Another factor contributing to China's tourism boom is its
sound relationship with foreign countries. The year 1997 is also
the 25th anniversary of the diplomatic ties between China and
Japan. Mutual high-level visits are scheduled between the country
and the United States, France, and India.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Political Leaders Express Sorrow Over Deng's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Japanese political leaders
joined Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto today in expressing
condolences on the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto visited the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo to express
sorrow over Deng's death.
</P>
<P>
"I really want to express heartfelt sorrow, all the more
because his existence was great," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He hailed Deng's achievements in creating the foundations for
the current stable Sino-Japanese relationship, which the prime
minister said has been handed down to the present generations.
</P>
<P>
Other political leaders also voiced memories of the late
Chinese leader.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Deng Xiaoping was a pioneer of China's new reforms and
open-door economic policy and I'm sure this line will continue and
become much more certain to help develop the country," Susumu
Nikkaido, an 87-year-old veteran politician, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Nikkaido served as chief cabinet secretary for the
administration of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka at a time when
Japan and China normalized diplomatic relations in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said Deng was a great
Chinese leader in the postwar era, in addition to Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Deng Xiaoping was very devoted to cooperation among Japan,
the United States and China," Nakasone said.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he appreciated
Deng's unusual ability to have made remarkable progress both in
the lives of the Chinese people and the country's power.
</P>
<P>
Yoshiro Hayashi, chairman of the Japanese Deitmen's League for
Japan-China Friendship, praised Deng's achievements in concluding
the 1978 Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty and in
promoting friendly and cooperative relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"I will continue my efforts toward much better Japan-China ties
in accordance with his last wishes," Hayashi said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Deng Xiaoping's Pass-Away Mourned in Macao (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Along with the slow rhythm of the
dirge, officials of the Macao Government and celebrities in Macao
queued in, stood still and bowed their heads, before a huge
portrait of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Among those who paid their last respect to the late Chinese
leader were Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio, who is on a visit
to Macao prior to his state visit to Beijing next week, Macao
Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira, top officials of the Macao
government, all members of the Macao Legislative Assembly (LA),
and heads of leading local communities.
</P>
<P>
The mourning hall was instantly set up by noon today in the
building of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch. Deng passed away
last night.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch, was
among the first to pay the last homage. All top officials of the
agency were present at the mourning ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The director praised Deng as an outstanding leader, the "chief
architect of China's policy of reform and opening to the outside
world", "creator of the theory of building socialism with China
characteristics" and a "great patriot."
</P>
<P>
"The great idea of 'one country, two systems' pioneered by Deng
is an everlasting contribution to the handling of the issues of Hong
Kong, Macao and of Taiwan, to the peaceful reunification of the
motherland," Wang said in a speech this morning. "While mourning
over his pass-away, we should work hard to implement the policy of
'one country, two systems' and ensure a stable transition of Macao
so that his great idea would come into reality."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Deng Xiaoping's Pass-Away Mourned in Macao (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That praise was echoed by most local residents here in Macao.
Ordinary citizens and officials agree that Deng was one of the
greatest leaders not only in China, but throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
"Deng's theory of 'one country, two systems' in solving the Hong
Kong and Macao issues created a good example in handling historical
disputes among different nations in the world," said Ma Man Kei,
president of the Macao Chamber of Commerce. "His pass-away is a huge
loss to all people in China."
</P>
<P>
Another well-known local businessman, Ng Fok, deeply grieved
over the pass-away of Deng, saying people should not forget the one
who brought them good life.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people are living an ever-improving life under
Deng's policy of reform and opening to the outside world over the
past dozen years," said Ng, who is also member of the standing
committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). "All Chinese people
should carry on his will and make China stronger day by day."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most people are optimistic about China's political
stability, economic growth and the continuity of the policy of "one
country, two systems' in post-Deng era.
</P>
<P>
Hau-Wah Ho, president of the Macao Association of Banks and
member of the Standing Committee of the 8th National People's
Congress (NPC), believed that Deng's pass-away would bring no
negative effect to China.
</P>
<P>
"The pass-away of Mr. Deng Xiaoping is most saddenly although he
is a very-old man," he said while offering his condolences at the
Xinhua branch. "But I deeply believe that his pass-away will have no
effect on the policy of the Chinese Government or any negative
influences on the policy on Macao and on Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
He said that although the policy on Hong Kong and Macao originated
from Deng, it has constituted the policy of the Chinese government.
"So I don't think the pass-away of Mr. Deng Xiaoping would have any
adverse adjustment on the policy on Macao."
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the Chinese government has been under Jiang
Zemin for a few years after Deng retired. Politically, the Chinese
Government would remain stable after Deng's pass-away.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Venezuelan Foreign Ministers Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks here this afternoon with
visiting Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel A. Burelli Rivas, and
both later co-chaired the second political consultation between
the two foreign ministries.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Venezuelan government and people, Burelli
first expressed his profound sympathies over the death of Deng
Xiaoping, the former revolutionary leader who died on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Deng made great contributions not only to the
prosperity of China, but also to world peace, and that he will be
remembered forever.
</P>
<P>
Expressing thanks for Burelli's comment, Qian said that the
Chinese people will continue along the path of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, a path initiated by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Qian welcomed Burelli to China, saying that
in the past few years the friendship and cooperation between China
and Venezuela has been healthy and developed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
There have been more high-level exchanges and mutual trust has
deepened, Qian went on to say, adding that Chinese Premier Li
Peng's successful visit to Venezuela last November promoted
bilateral relations to a new level.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic and trade cooperation, Qian noted that
the two economies are highly complementary, and the development
momentum is good.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side is interested in conducting cooperation with
Venezuela in fields of energy, mining, agriculture and forestry,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the cooperation in cut oil, holding that
bilateral involvement in this regard will lead to a brighter
future for Sino-Venezuelan ties.
</P>
<P>
Praising bilateral ties in international affairs, Qian said
that China and Venezuela, as two developing countries, share the
same or similar views on many important international issues and
have experienced very good cooperation in international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government appreciates the Venezuelan
government's support for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization and the Inter-American Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the Chinese government's appreciation for
Venezuelan government's "one China" position on the question of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Saying he is satisfied with the development of Venezuela-China
relations, Burelli said that the two countries have had frequent
exchanges and bilateral relations are becoming ever closer,
especially in light of Li Peng's visit to Venezuela last year,
which greatly pushed forward the further development of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
He continued that the two countries have much in common in
bilateral and multi-lateral affairs, and the prospect for
bilateral cooperation in energy is encouraging.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela, China Should Strengthen Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Venezuelan Foreign
Minister Miguel A. Burelli Rivas said that both Venezuela and
China have rich oil resources, and the two sides should strengthen
technological and economic exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Burelli made the remark here this morning at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences in his speech titled "Venezuelan
Agenda."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that his country is the second largest oil
producer and exporter in Latin America, and its reserve of
super-heavy oil tops the world, adding that the cut oil made from
this heavy oil is Venezuela's patent product.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China is rich in heavy oil reserves, Burelli said
that the two countries have a broad prospect for oil recovering
and processing, and they should strengthen economic contacts.
</P>
<P>
On the Venezuelan agenda, Burelli said that his country
initiated this new economic open policy last April.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this agenda has drawn many foreign investors to
Venezuela to explore oil and minerals, which has helped the
Venezuelan economy to recover from the crisis in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China ordered eight million tons of cut oil from
Venezuela, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian political and
business leaders today expressed their condolences over the death
of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping who died in Beijing on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, including Prime Minister John Howard, highly
praised Deng's historic contributions over the past decades and
his leadership of turning China into an economic powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
"Deng's lasting legacy is the opening up and reform policies he
championed and which enabled a new and dynamic economic
relationship to develop between Australia and China," Deputy Prime
Minister Tim Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"Deng was very much the architect of modern China, his push for
economic reform created what is known in China as socialism with
Chinese characteristics, the opening of the economy has been an
enormous achievement that has yielded economic growth rates at
about 10 percent per annum," Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Kim Beazley said Deng was a truly historic
figure who made a pivotal contribution to the modernization of
China.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese leadership appears fully committed to ongoing
economic reform, and that will translate into higher disposable
incomes for the bulk of the population," said a leading business
figure.
</P>
<P>
Australia has invested 4.9 billion Australian dollars (about
3.82 billion U.S. dollars) in China since the late 1970s when Deng
opened up the most populous country to the outside world.

<HEADLINE> Mahdi on Peace in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader Ali
Mahdi Mohamed today accused Hussein Mohamed Aidid of making
obstacles to the Banadir region peace process initiated by
Italian special envoy to Somalia Giuseppe Cassini.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists in his office in north Mogadishu, Ali
Mahdi charged that Hussein Aidid has failed to honor the
trilateral peace accord he signed in Nairobi to achieve peace in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi said Aidid agreed to sit down with him over a solution
to Mogadishu, but rejected the participation of Osman Ali Atto in
such talks.
</P>
<P>
Otto, formerly a financier of the senior Aidid who later fell
out and left his faction, fought bitterly against Aidid, and was
said to have caused him to die of bullet wounds last August.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Otto becomes a bitter enemy of junior Aidid who has
vowed to take revenge on him and refused to negotiate with him on
peace in the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi described the refusal of Aidid as "an unfortunate
obstacle" to the peace process, saying, "i consider Osman Atto as
major back bone for any solution to Banadir region including the
opening of Mogadishu's air and seaport."
</P>
<P>
However, Mahdi said he will continue to make contact with
Hussein Aidid through the Italian envoy in order to minimize the
gap between the factions of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Cassini left Mogadishu two days ago after holding a week-long
discussion with Ali Mahdi and other community leaders in the
capital. Cassini who met Aidid and Ali Atto in Nairobi is
expected to return to Mogadishu during the first week of March to
further continue his peace shuttle.

<HEADLINE> Pseudo-Science Seminar in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The China Association of
Science and Technology, China's largest science NGO, held a
seminar on superstition and pseudo-science in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the seminar was to discuss trends and dangers of
those who believe in witchcraft and what should be done to deal
with it.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 people from the fields of medicine, psychology,
religion, history, and the social sciences attended the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Witchcraft has become popular in recent years after having been
dormant for a rather long period of time, since the founding of
the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Compared with traditional witchcraft, the modern version is
practiced under the cloak of science and traditional culture, and
thus is strongly suggestive, according to participants, who noted
that witches and sorcerers have markedly undermined national
economic construction, social development, and people's lives, and
there must be a crack-down to stop them.
</P>
<P>
They called on science workers to beef up efforts to promote
public understanding of science and to endeavor to root out
various superstitious activities with the people.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Business Circles Saddened by Deng's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Chinese
Chamber of Commerce &AMP; Industry (SCCCI) said here today that it was
saddened by the passing of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and hoped
that the Sino-Singapore relationship will further strengthen in
the post-Deng era.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the SCCCI said, "Mr. Deng Xiaoping will be
remembered in world history as a great statesman of extraordinary
vision who has led China on its path to modernization," it said.
</P>
<P>
The SCCCI also said that at the height of his political career
in the early 1980s, Deng Xiaoping "took bold measures to open up
China's economy and introduce major economic reforms which have
set in motion China's spectacular progress to be a world
superpower in the political, economic and other arenas."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Singapore has always enjoyed strong ties with
China, the chamber said, with China's modernization policy,
Sino-Singapore relations have also strengthened particularly in
the fields of commerce and investment.
</P>
<P>
"With the firm commitment of China's leadership to continue
with the reforms introduced by the late Mr. Deng, the
international community can look forward to China's active and
constructive participation in the world's affairs," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Against this backdrop, the chamber expects the Sino-Singapore
relationship to further strengthen in the post-Deng era based on
the solid foundations that have been laid," it said.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the death of Deng Xiaoping, the government Economic
Development Board (EDB) said it was confident that investments
between China and Singapore would continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the EDB said that through its regionalization
program, it would continue to assist companies to venture into
China and the region. Singapore is now the fifth largest foreign
investor in China with 1.86 billion U.S. dollars as at the end of
1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) advocates the adoption of "a new
constitution, a new state symbol and new law for elections" and
decentralized administrative power.
</P>
<P>
This is contained in the political program UNITA dished out by
a senior official here late last night for the national
government of unity and reconciliation to be set up here soon.
</P>
<P>
Politically, UNITA stands for the "consolidation of peace,
safeguard national independence, territorial integrity and
national unity," and "strengthen the democracy for the state's
political life," according to the program.
</P>
<P>
It favors readjustment of the legislative structure and
freedom of the press, Isaias Samakuva, UNITA team leader to the
joint commission with the government, made known the
above-mentioned program at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Economically, he noted, UNITA stands for "a market economy
with the private sector as the powerhouse", a transparent budget
and a readjusted public monetary order.
</P>
<P>
State revenues and expenditure should be made known to the
public, corruption fought against and priority of investment
should go to agriculture, education, health and infrastructure,
he said.
</P>
<P>
If the government accepts this political program, the main
obstacles impeding the formation of the national government of
unity and reconciliation and the assumption of posts by UNITA
members of parliament would be removed, Samakuva said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Issues New High-tech IDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Within a few days, more
Egyptians could get their new state-of-the-art identity (ID) cards
which would be hard to forge but easy to distinguish the
namesakes, Egypt's Al-Ahram daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 45 million Egyptians are expected to obtain their ID
cards from a number of mobile electronic registration offices
massed all over the country, the paper quoted Interior Minister
Hassan al-Alfy as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new national code system applies a unique number that the
person will have from his birth to his death.
</P>
<P>
It provides an easy approach to identify people with similar
names by including 14 figures for their birthdays, governorate
codes, insurance codes made by the computer.
</P>
<P>
The new ID machines can issue the code in less than one minute
according to the latest international specifications which
guarantee protection against forgery, according to the Arabic
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
This is certainly good news to the security authority that has
been constantly baffled by the swarms of criminals that usually
carry false passports and IDs.
</P>
<P>
The new ID system will also help facilitate procedures and
guarantee an easy and quick service for citizens.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has purchased about 75 electronically-equipped vehicles
which will tour various districts to collect IDs and issue
documents for citizens.
</P>
<P>
This project will enable Egypt for the first time to make an
accurate mapping of its demographic data and distribution and thus
to facilitate the government's decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
After the Interior Ministry finalized preparations for the
issuance of 12 million ID cards in Greater Cairo and some 33
million cards in other governorates, the first test ID card was
issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Within three years, all citizens will hold the new IDs
according to the government plan, said the Egyptian daily.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Rules Out Links of Captured Japanese with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese judicial
authority today ruled out links of several Japanese, arrested by
the police at the weekend, with the so-called "Red Army," a
radical Japanese organization allegedly involved in 1970s'
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Adnan Addoum, the Lebanese state prosecutor, stressed that
the detained Japanese have no ties with the Japanese "Red
Army."
</P>
<P>
This was the first official statement made by the judicial
authority clarifying the doubts raised since the police took a
sudden action against several Japanese citizens in the capital
of Beirut last Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
No words have been given by Lebanese officials on how
many Japanese were locked up, and the Beirut media said up
to seven persons, including a Lebanese woman, were arrested.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in the Judicial Ministry, Addoum
described recent media reports on the issue were "groundless."
</P>
<P>
He said that those Japanese who were captured by the
security forces "do not have links with the Red Army, but
have relations with some cases different from that of the Red
Army."
</P>
<P>
"Some Japanese are arrested, that does not necessarily mean
that they are members of the Red Army," he said, "if you
go into a Japanese restaurant, you will find dozens of
Japanese there."
</P>
<P>
He said that Omaya Aboud, a female, was the only Lebanese
who is currently in custody, and investigations are underway
with her about her visits to Japan in the past years.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Lebanese National News Agency reported that
Japanese ambassador to Lebanon Yasuji Ishikagi, accompanying two
officers of Tokyo's anti-terrorism department, held a meeting
here this morning with Bahij Tabbara, Minister of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources said that only one of the Japanese
arrested in West Beirut at the weekend has a Japanese
passport, and all others carry forged passports of foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the information on the arrest was first disclosed in
Japan Tuesday, some 50 Japanese journalists have arrived in
Beirut to cover what they regard as a major story for their
audiences back home.
</P>
<P>
Some a dozen of the Japanese "Red Army" members are reportedly
 still at large and they are supposedly hiding in some place in
the Middle East, very possibly in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The radical "Red Army", founded in 1971, is accused of
involvement in a series of terrorist activities in the region,
including the May 1972 shootout at Tel Aviv's Lodd Airport in
which 24 people were killed and some 100 wounded.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Opposition Mounts Anti-Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' biggest
opposition party, the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP), today
officially launched a nationwide drive against constitutional
amendments.
</P>
<P>
LDP Chairman Edgardo Angara and other party bigwigs led a
protest rally attended by at least 2,000 members from all sectors
in Legazpi city in Albay province in the central Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The rally was reportedly held in compliance with the LDP's
National Executive Council's mandate to prevent "power hungered'
politicians from toying with the country's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
During the rally, Angara appealed to the public to preserve the
Charter which guards against resurgence of dictatorship and
forbids President Fidel Ramos and other elective officials to seek
second terms of office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senator Juan Flavier said the ruling party
Lakas-NUCD is likely to put to a vote in response to House Speaker
Jose de Venecia's call for the party to keep a hands-off policy to
Charter change movements.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia said earlier that he has convinced 35 Lakas-NUCD
senior officials to distance themselves from and discourage moves
to convene Congress into a Constituent Assembly to amend the
Charter.
</P>
<P>
Flavier said a resolution which clearly states the party's
support to Charter changes would soon be submitted to the party's
National Directorate for approval.
</P>
<P>
If the resolution was approved, the ruling party would continue
to pursue amendments to the Constitution either through a
Constituent Assembly or a people's initiative, Flavier said.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos, also chairman of the Lakas-NUCD party,
recently called for changes in the Constitution after the
country's judiciary meddled in some of the government's
businesses.

BAGHDAD, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) Rolf Ekeus arrived here today on a
routine visit to the sanctions-hit country.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus, Chairman of the UNSCOM in charge of disarming Iraq,
arrived here from Moscow, from where he pays a regular visit to
Iraq every two months.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Ekeus will try to solve the lingering
problems between his commission and the Iraqi side, western
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus must certify that Iraq has dismantled its biological
and chemical weapons along with missiles with a range of
more than 150 kilometers before the U.N. Security Council can
lift the crippling oil embargo imposed following Iraq's August
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>

The UNSCOM still suspects Iraq is hidding between six to 16 Scud
missiles like those fired on Saudi Arabia and Israel during the

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Killing Accident to Delay Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, February 20 (Xinhua) -- For most of the residents living
in the trouble-torn Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), their
just-soaring peace hopes were quickly dashed by some tribal rebels
trying to scuttle the peace process of the forested areas.
</P>
<P>
On February 15, a group of insurgents killed three policemen in
the Bandarban district in a surprise attack. They struck again the
following day, ambushing an army patrol scouting the area for the
armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
The attacks, which were attributed to a hard-line faction of
the so-called Shanti Bahini insurgents, threw the nearly
five-year-old ceasefire in the CHT off-balance.
</P>
<P>
They are sending a signal, forcing their political wing, the
Parbatya Chattragram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS), currently
negotiating with the government for peace, to extract more
concessions, said Shehab Ahmed, an influential political analyst.
</P>
<P>
The killing incident also defied the ceasefire between the
security forces and the Buddhist Chakma rebels, who have been
fighting a bush war since 1973 for autonomy of the 14,200
square-kilometer three hill districts.
</P>
<P>
Since the truce was reached on August 1992, although the rebels
have never hold that much value, ten rounds of peace talks have
been held for a permanent solution to the resource-rich hill
districts in southeast Bangladesh bordering India and Burma.
</P>
<P>
During the last round of talks late last month, taking place in
the capital Dhaka for the first time, the government and the PCJSS
reached consensus on many issues such as formation of a regional
council and withdrawal of troops from the hill districts.
</P>
<P>
However, the peace talks hit a snag when they could not
overcome the issue of the withdrawal of the Muslim settlers from
the tribal areas, which is linked with the land dispute.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, claiming their land was forcefully occupied, want
expulsion of all settlers from the over-crowded plains, who make
up about half of the hill regions population of about 800,000,
spilt in 13 ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The government, although promising no fresh migration, insisted
that those who had settled there could not be forced out.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a delegation of the National Committee
on the CHT is visiting northeast India's Tripura state, trying to
persuade about 50,000 tribes people, living in squalid refugee
camps, to return home.
</P>
<P>
Though New Delhi has always denied its involvement, it is clear
that the Shanti Bahini were offered sanctuary in India, said a
South Asia diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The recent Indo-Bangladesh honeymoon, however, is likely to be
a big factor in bringing the rebels to an agreement, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina also expressed her
optimism that the CHT problems would be solved and a just solution
would be found.
</P>
<P>
"Such incident took place as some vested groups, including
drugs and arms dealers, are active to foil the government's peace
efforts and keep the problem alive," she said.
</P>
<P>
"But nothing could stop our move towards bringing back peace
and stability in the hill tracts. I'm hopeful about a solution
soon," she added.
</P>
<P>
The killing incident, however, shows that the peace efforts
will not go as smooth as silk, though the next round of peace
talks is expected to be held on March 12.

<HEADLINE> First Aircraft Landing Performed at HK New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A small aircraft of the Hong
Kong Government Flying Service (GFS) performed a successful
landing today at the southern runway of the Chek Lap Kok new
airport.
</P>
<P>
Carrying five passengers headed by Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang, this was the first ever landing by a fixed-wing aircraft at
the new airport, and "marks a significant milestone in the
progress of its construction," said the Civil Aviation Department.
</P>
<P>
The plane took off from Kai Tak airport and eased onto the
first of the two runways of Chek Lap Kok after a journey of
15 to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Tsang disembarked from the aircraft at about 12:45 p.m.,
accompanied by Chairman of the Airport Authority Wong Po-yan,
Secretary for Economic Services Stephen Ip, Director of the New
Airport Projects Coordination Office Billy Lam, and Director of
Civil Aviation Richard Siegel.
</P>
<P>
The first landing set the stage for commencement at the end of
the month of calibration flight checks for the newly installed
Instrument Landing System (ILS).
</P>
<P>
A CAD spokesman said a number of approaches and landings will
be made on the runway during the process of calibration which will
last for six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
The ILS is a navigational aid which provides accurate azimuth
and descending guidance information to pilots to ensure a safe
landing under all weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with the one installed at Kai Tak, the ILS at Chek
Lap Kok can allow aircraft to land on the runway even under poorer
visibility condition," the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
In parallel with the landing, two access expressways to the new
airport were opened to traffic at 10:00 a.m. today. Both were
constructed under one of the world's largest infrastructure
programs, the Airport Core Program (ACP).
</P>
<P>
Officiating at Wednesday's opening ceremony of the West Kowloon
Expressway and Kwai Chung Viaduct, Chief Secretary Anson Chan
revealed that 76 percent of the program had been finished by the
end of January this year.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the ten ACP projects, including the world's largest
road and rail suspension bridge, cross-harbor and road tunnels as
well as expressways, are expected to be opened for public use in
the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Together they will form a 34-kilometer transport corridor
linking Hong Kong Island to the new airport and Tung Chung new
town.
</P>
<P>
A series of events are being arranged by the government to
celebrate the opening of the corridor.
</P>
<P>
The Chek Lap Kok airport proper is expected to be put into use
in April 1998, and the airport railway two months later.
</P>
<P>
The new airport will replace Kai Tak literally overnight, with
a handling capacity of 87 million passengers and nine million tons
of cargo per year after both runways are opened.
</P>
<P>
The latest ACP budget estimate was 156 billion HK dollars (20
billion U.S. dollars).

NEW DELHI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Shankar
Dayal Sharma today declared that India was "ready" for a dialogue
with the new government of Pakistan and committed to ending
confrontation while hoping for an early resumption of the stalled
bilateral talks, Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the joint session of parliament marking the
commencement of the budget session, Sharma said that India wanted
to establish a harmonious relationship and durable peace with
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
This was President Sharma's first address to parliament after

assumed office last June.
</P>
<P>
Referring to domestic issues, Sharma voiced the government's
concern over corruption in public life and expressed its
determination to take effective steps to eradicate "this evil."
</P>
<P>
He said an action plan will be placed soon before a conference
of chief ministers to take necessary steps to increase
transparency and accountability in the administration at all
levels as part of a strategy to have an effective and responsive
administration.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the economic liberalization policy, he said the
government was committed to economic reforms aimed at faster
economic growth and action has also been initiated to create the
confidence that investors will get fair and equal treatment.
</P>
<P>
Sharma further said India was committed to achieving its goal
of attracting foreign direct investment to the tune of at least 10
billion U.S. dollars a year.

Commenting on these figures, a government spokesman said that
labor market conditions showed further improvement in the most
recent months.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines, Japan to Hold Air Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Air talks between the
Philippines and Japan are scheduled to start in Tokyo in the first
week of March, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Philippine delegation is expected to ask
for the inclusion of additional all-cargo entitlements in the Air
Services Agreement (ASA).
</P>
<P>
The Pacific East Asia Cargo Airlines (PEAC), owned jointly by
the Philippine government and an Australian firm, is the country's
official all-cargo carrier.
</P>
<P>
PEAC chief executive officer Captain Benjamin Solis said they
will press for more all-cargo frequencies since Japan's Nippon
Cargo Airlines Ltd. (NCA) is already using all the entitlements
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have long wanted to operate in the RP-Japan route but there
are no more entitlements left for us. Japan is a big market,"
Solis said.
</P>
<P>
PEAC earlier opposed NCA's application to the Civil Aeronautics
Board (CAB) to operate all-cargo flights because of the Japanese
Civil Aviation Bureau's refusal to give PEAC a similar authority.
</P>
<P>
PEAC has been seeking a foreign carrier's permit from the
Japanese government since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Japan rejected the PEAC's application on the ground that
neither the Philippine-Japan ASA nor the memorandum of agreement
(MOA) between the two countries provides for all-cargo air traffic
rights.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine-Japan ASA was signed in January 1992 while the
MOA, which contains the detailed entitlement provided for in the
ASA, was inked in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, Japan granted NCA an authority to operate one weekly
all-cargo flight which has a capacity of about 100 tons. At the
same time, the CAB also issued a Temporary Operating Permit (TOP)
to NCA despite PEAC's opposition.
</P>
<P>
"Actually we are not opposing the NCA's services. What we want
is an equal opportunity to operate similar services. That is why
we will lobby for an all-cargo entitlement during the air talks,"
Solis said.

<HEADLINE> Guerrillas, Israeli Forces Clash in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces opened violent
artillery fire at suspected guerrilla targets in south Lebanon
this morning in an apparent retaliation for a guerrilla attack
at an Israeli patrol in the so-called "security zone."
</P>
<P>
Police sources in south Lebanon reported that the "Israeli
occupation forces," from their positions in the "security zone,"
bombarded a number of targets at Iglim Al-Toffah, a height some
60 kilometers southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces fired 155mm heavy artillery shells and
burning bombs at Jabel Al-Rafih, Wadi Akhdar and the basin of the
Litani river in Iglim Al-Toffah, which is often used by the
Lebanese Muslim guerrillas as a springboard to launch attacks at
the Israeli forces, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli artillery also shelled the vicinities of some
villages in the Nabatiyeh area, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were caused in the bombardment, in which the
Israelis also used flechettes, the anti-personnel shells which
spray hundreds of darts when exploding, the anonymous sources
noted.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses coming from inside the occupied border strip said
that they heard a series of powerful explosions in the central
sector of the buffer zone earlier this morning without
identifying the causes.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syrian Amal Movement announced that its guerrillas
ambushed this morning an Israeli patrol near the crusade castle
of Shaqif in the central sector of the so-called "security
zone."
</P>
<P>
Amal, headed by Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri, said in a
statement that the guerrillas planted a number of bombs on the
road which the "Israeli occupation forces" usually used to
transfer troops to the position of Shaqif.
</P>
<P>
It said that the guerrillas detonated bombs at 4:15 a.m. (0215
GMT) when an Israeli Merkava tank carrying Israeli foot soldiers
arrived at the site of ambush.
</P>
<P>
The dawn attack led to the killing and wounding of several
Israeli soldiers, the Shiite Muslim group said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that some half an hour after the operation, Israeli
helicopters flew to the scene and moved the wounded and bodies to
the Shaqif position, then from there to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli reinforcing troops also rushed to the fighting place
and carried out a sweep around the area, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
However, neither the attack nor the casualties have been
officially confirmed by the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
also announced that they launched an attack at a position of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia at Tomat Niha in the
border strip at 6:00 p.m. (0400 GMT) this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, said
in a statement that its guerrillas used machineguns and
rocket-propelled grenades in the clash with the SLA Militia.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas and
bombardments by Israeli forces constitute a daily scene in south
Lebanon, the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese guerrillas have killed one Israeli soldier and
wounded 22 others since the beginning of this year, and in Israeli
retaliatory actions, one Lebanese civilian was killed and several
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attacks. Enitem

<P>
Hong Kong is presently administered by the British Hong Kong

which is safeguarded by the Director reporting directly to the
Legislative Council; the Independent Commission Against Corruption
and the Office of the Commissioner for Administrative Complaints,
whose independence is safeguarded by having the Commissioners
report directly to the Governor; the Judiciary, which is the
responsibility of the Chief Justice; and the Legal Department,
which is the responsibility of the Attorney General.
</P>
<P>
When Hong Kong returns to the motherland on July 1, 1997, the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will be
established.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Pandemic Declines in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of HIV infection
cases have obviously declined in Uganda during the last five
years, according to an official report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by Uganda's AIDS Control Program, was based
on serial collection of data on HIV prevalence in six selected
sites in the country among pregnant women attending antenatal
clinic and patients attending sexually transmitted disease (STD)
clinics.
</P>
<P>
"A steady decline of HIV cases has been witnessed since 1991,"
said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said infection rate in the districts of Nsambya and Rubaga
in the capital of Kampala, dropped separately from 27.8 and 27.4
percent in 1991 to 16.8 and 20.2 percent by 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the eastern city of Jinja, the rate dropped from 22.0 to
13.2 percent. In the eastern border city of Tororo, it dropped
from 12.8 to 12.4 percent. In another eastern city of Mbale, it
dropped from 12.1 to 7.7 percent. And in the southwest city of
Mbarara, it dropped from 24.4 to 16.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another medical survey, done in 1994/1995 among 400 blood
samples, also confirmed the decline of HIV infection, a local
newspaper, "the Monitor", reported today.
</P>

<P>
MACAO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio, who arrived here Tuesday on a six-day visit, made an
official statement today to mourn the loss of Deng Xiaoping,
praising him as a man as great as "Dr. Sun yat-sen and Mao Zedong."
</P>
<P>
"Deng conquered a place of major significance in the 20th
century of China," said Sampaio, who canceled his scheduled plans
of visit for today for Deng's death. "He was as great as Dr. Sun
Yat-sen and Mao Zedong. His life and political course were
unseparable from the history of China."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it was Deng's policies that made it possible
for the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the
Question of Macao in 1987.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of 'One Country, Two Systems' is closely linked
with the policy of reform and opening to the outside world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Macao government has ordered that all its departments fly
their flags at half-mast.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian, Israeli Experts Meet on Joint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 20 (Xinhua) - Technical experts from Jordan and
Israel met in Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba today to discuss the
feasibility of constructing a joint Israeli-Jordanian airport
there, Jordan's news agency, Petra, reported today.
</P>
<P>
The participants are expected to approve designs and studies for
the project, which is estimated to cost 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-financed feasibility study was finalized last July at a
cost of 500,000 dollars, but since then no technical meeting has
been held for more detailed discussions.
</P>
<P>
Aqaba is the only port in Jordan and Iraq began to use it to
import food and medicine from the beginning of year.
</P>
<P>
One of the problems facing the construction of an airport in
Aqaba was an Israeli demand that the future airport be confined
to international flights, but Jordan opposes the demand.
</P>
<P>
Once the agreement is finalized, the two sides will invite bids
from private sector firms for the airport's construction.
</P>
<P>
Flights between Jordanian capital Amman and Israeli city Tel
Aviv, and between Amman and Israeli port Haifa is operating
according to earlier agreements, and occupancy on board of the
shuttle planes is estimated at 60 to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Royal Wings, an affiliate of Royal Jordanian,
initiated semi-weekly flights between Amman and Haifa.

<HEADLINE> Food to Arrive at Kenya for Disaster Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Food cargo ships will dock at
Mombasa Port of Kenya, delivering about 150,000 tons of maize and
wheat to arrest the looming famine crisis in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian Embassy to Kenya, the first batch
of maize, imported from Ethiopia and totaling 14,000 tons, is due
at the port this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Contracts for a total of 49,000 tons of maize have been
finalized between three Kenyan companies and Ethiopia Grain Trade
Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, six cargo ships are expected at the port to deliver
100,000 tons of maize and wheat imported from Zimbabwe and
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Last week, two ships completed discharging consignments of
23,000 tons of yellow and white maize, and 7,300 tons of sugar at
the port.
</P>
<P>
These are the first food consignments to arrive in Kenya after
President Daniel arap Moi declared the famine a national disaster
last month.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is set to import some 640,000 tons of
maize, wheat and other foodstuff to cover the current production
shortfall caused by prolonged drought in most parts of the
country, according to government officials.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has lifted a ban on maize imports and removed all duties
and taxes on imported maize, wheat and other classified food
commodities.
</P>
<P>
The current famine has seriously affected people in parts of
Eastern, Northeastern, Coast, Rift Valley, Western and Central
provinces, making emergency food relief a priority.

<HEADLINE> Deng Family's Letter To Jiang Zemin And Party Central Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The funeral committee for
Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who passed away Wednesday night in Beijing,
today released a letter sent by Deng's family to Jiang Zemin,
General Secretary of the Communist Party of China's Central
Committee, and to the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Following is the text of the letter, dated February 15, in
full:
</P>
<P>
General Secretary Jiang and the Party Central Committee:
</P>
<P>
Recently the illness of Comrade Xiaoping has turned serious,
and we, as his family members, have very heavy hearts. We know
that the Party Central Committee comrades have all been greatly
concerned about Comrade Xiaoping, and must have begun to consider
arrangements for his funeral, as have we.
</P>
<P>
As a complete materialist, Comrade Xiaoping always has a
philosophical view of life and death, and has talked many times
with us about his own funeral affairs. To illustrate Comrade
Xiaoping's lifelong pursuits and beliefs and to perfectly close
the last chapter of his life, we make the following suggestions in
accordance with his will:
</P>
<P>
First, there should be no farewell ceremony for his
remains. Comrade Xiaoping always believed in simple and frugal
funerals, and it is in keeping with his ideas that no farewell
ceremony be held.
</P>
<P>
Second, the memorial meeting should be held after the
cremation. The casket will be covered by a Party flag of the CPC,
with a color photo that displays the superb mental outlook of
Comrade Xiaoping above it, to express the solemn atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Third, there should be no mourning hall at home.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, Comrade Xiaoping's corneas should be donated to an
eyebank and his body be dissected for the purpose of medical
research.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, No ashes should be preserved. It is the wish of Comrade
Xiaoping himself that his ashes be cast into the sea.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Xiaoping has devoted his entire life to the motherland
and the people without any reservation. We hope that the last
thing we do for him will reflect the essence of his mental
outlook, and express our grief in an utterly plain and solemn way.
</P>
<P>
Please consider our suggestions.

<HEADLINE> Thai government Mourns Deng's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government issued a
statement today, expressing condolences over the death of Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Thai government had learned the news of
Deng's death with sadness and viewed his demise as "a great loss
to the world."
</P>
<P>
Since Thailand and China established diplomatic ties in 1975,
Deng has been a main figure to promote friendly relations and
cooperation between the two countries in various fields, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Deng's 1978 visit to Thailand not only strengthened Sino-Thai
ties but also helped promote peace and stability in the region, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government praised Deng for pioneering economic
reforms in China. The success of his reform policy reflected in
the country's achieving economic growth rate of more than 10
percent during the past years.
</P>
<P>
Deng was also behind successful negotiations on the return of
Hong Kong to China under the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle,
said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Contagious Diseases in Vietnamese Children Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 20 (Xinhua) - The number of children
contracting the six major child killer diseases reduced sharply
last year, public health ministry said in a report to review the
expanded immunisation vaccination programme in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report revealed that the rate of diptheria dropped by 14.4
percent whooping cough, 37.1 percent tetanus, 22.1 percent
measles, 16.4 percent and polio, 83.3 percent. with only two cases
of wild polio detected in lam dong and vinh long provinces, the
disease rate dropped six times compared to 1995. Anti-natal
tetanus was eliminated in 556 out of 557 districts across the
country last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of children contracting measles and whooping cough
steadily dropped in northern provinces while the trend seemed to
increase in southern provinces last year.
</P>
<P>
Reduction of these diseases' recurrence was attributed to high
rates of children receiving vaccinations against the six child
killer diseases: whooping cough, measles, polio, tetanus,
diptheria, and tuberculosis in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year, nearly 1.81 million or 95.4 per cent of the children
under one year were immunised against the six child killer
diseases. Over 1.64 million pregnant women, accounting for 82.11
percent of such women were vaccinated against
tetanus. Vaccinations against tetanus were also given to 97.7
percent of women in the reproductive age group.
</P>
<P>
Elaine Furniss, acting representative of the United Nations
Children Fund (UNICEF) in Vietnam, said that his organisation has
paid special attention to immunisation work in remote highlands,
and high risk areas.

MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate leaders
today joined the entire nation in mourning the passing away of
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"We regret the loss of a Chinese leader who has led the opening
up of the People's Republic of China to the rest of the world,"

Senate President Pro Tempore Blas Ople said not only China but
even the whole of Asia lost a great leader with Deng's passing
away.
</P>
<P>
Blas Ople said Deng, as the architect of China's reforms, has
also served the cause of world peace and stability by steering the
world's largest nation on a course of opening up to the world and
cooperation with the international community.
</P>

outlook, without abandoning China's ideological essence," Ople
said.

affect China's diplomatic ties with other countries, stressing

<HEADLINE> Steady Growth In Chinese Economy For January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China's economy maintained its
steady upward move in January, with most macro-economic indices
showing smooth increases and the overall economic situation
staying healthy, according to a monthly economic report released
today by the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The report said that, the country's industrial growth rate
slowed down slightly in the first month for "some seasonal factors
and other effects caused by the structural readjustment in
industrial sectors."
</P>
<P>
Last month saw China's industrial growth increment rise by 10.3
percent over the same period of 1996, representing a 2.8
percentage points decrease from last year's average.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of output to sales in industrial products stood at
92.4 percent, up 0.53 percentage points over the same period of
1996.
</P>
<P>
Consumer goods sales appeared brisk last month due to purchases
from New Year's Day through Spring Festival. Retail sales of
consumer goods reached 228.9 billion yuan, up 19.8 percent over
the same month last year, or up 16 percent at 1996 prices.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign trade volume was 21.7 billion US dollars
last month, 12.4 percent higher than for the same period of
1996. The export volume jumped by 27.5 percent, to 11.7 billion
dollars in January, while imports were down by 1.2 percent, at 10
billion dollars. The monthly trade surplus was 1.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's price increases continued to lose some steam in
January, with the national retail price index up 3.3 percent and
the consumer price index up 5.9 percent, representing the smallest
increase in recent years.
</P>
<P>
SSB analysts say that the January economic performance signaled
a good start for the year and laid a solid foundation for sound
and steady development.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches PR Campaign Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Foreign
Ministry has launched a public relations (PR) campaign by
disseminating a six-page document this week to its diplomatic
missions around the world to neutralize Palestinian accusations
that Israel is violating the Oslo Accords, The Jerusalem Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials say they want to counter a document
distributed by Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat on
February 2 to PLO missions abroad, listing specific
complaints. The Palestinian document has been forwarded to foreign
governments and the media.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with the London-based Al-Hayat
newspaper, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat noted
that Israel has suspended a total of 34 points from Oslo 1 and
Oslo 2 accords, including those related to the release of
thousands of Palestinian prisoners and the safe passage between
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Prime Minister's Office has frequently called on
the Foreign Ministry in the past to carry out an active PR
drive to offset Palestinian complaints abroad.
</P>
<P>
The document covers different subjects concerning Palestinian
construction in Hebron, removal of Bedouin herdsmen in the West
Bank, and confiscation of ID cards of Palestinians in East
Jerusalem with U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
On the subject of Palestinian ID cards, the document reads:
"Israel has not revoked the residency of any Palestinian who
is legally resident in Jerusalem. These Palestinians, like any
other individual who has lived in Israel continuously, can
continue to do so without loss of any benefit to which he
or she is entitled."
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. consular officials have protested the withdrawal
by Israeli authorities of the ID cards of the Palestinians with
American citizenship.

climates.

the same time, has more projects to offer in small and medium
scale industries.

In response to this allegations, the mayor told Jordan Times in

by the municipality, then they can take their complaints to the
court."

<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos issued a statement here today on the death of chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping, saying "We share with China, with his family,
relatives and loved ones a deep sense of loss over the passing of
the great man."
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Ramos said "We have learned with great
sadness" of the death Wednesday night of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the Philippine government and the Filipino

China, with his family, relatives and loved ones a deep sense of
loss over the passing of this great man," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping opened China to the world and brought
modernization and prosperity to the most populous country on
earth. He brought China closer to all its neighbors by setting
aside all barriers that had separated China from the rest of the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that Deng Xiaoping's dream of development at home
was reinforced by a vision of amity and cooperation within the

On this basis, Ramos said, he transformed his country into a
great state supporting regional and global stability, security,
harmony and peace.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines will always remember with gratitude that, as
Vice Premier of the State Council, Deng Xiaoping stood at the
center of events that led to the establishment of diplomatic
relations between our two countries in 1975. Since then, under his
wise counsel, our bilateral relations have deepened and
diversified," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The admirable achievements of Deng Xiaoping shaped a new
China. Their impact throughout China and in all of Asia-Pacific
will be felt long after his demise and far into the next
century. They have earned for him a prominent place in the world
history as one of the great leaders of our time," Ramos said.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Hopes for the Swazi
government and jailed leaders of the Swaziland Federation of
Trade Unions (SFTU) to reach a compromise have faded as the
leaders' trial went ahead on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This came after the Swazi government's talks on Monday with a
10-member delegation of International Trade Unions, South African
Press Association (SAPA) said.
</P>
<P>
The four trade union leaders, including SFTU President Richard
Nxumalo and Secretary-General Jan Sithole, pleaded not guilty to
a court charge of stirring up trouble in the public.
</P>
<P>
Tense situation in Swaziland began ever since the beginning of
February when the four union leaders were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The SFTU, which has launched an indefinite national strike,
demands Swazi King Mswati III reinstate constitutional rule and
lift a 24-year-old ban on all political activity in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The trial will continue today when more witnesses, believed to
be police officers supported by video footage, are expected to
give evidence.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Papers Lament Deng's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- All major Hong Kong
newspapers today carried out black banner headlines in the
frontages to lament the death of Deng Xiaoping, who passed away in
Beijing at around nine o'clock last night.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese and English papers devoted full pages to tracing
the 93-year life path of the Chinese paramount leader, his
contributions to China's economic and political reforms and his
strategic farsightedness in the reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
South China Morning Post carried out a streamer headline titled
 "Master strategist who changed the destiny of China". The English
 paper said that Deng's reform and open-door policy lead to
rebirth of a global powerhouse both in economic and diplomatic
arena.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Daily Mews says in today's commentary that Deng
changed the history of China and the destiny of Hong Kong
people. It was Deng who devised the unprecedented concept of "One
country, two systems", which successfully solved the problems
concerning Hong Kong and Macao. The commentary regrets that Deng
could not fulfill his long-cherished wish to be present at the
handover ceremony on June 30, 1997, when China resumes its
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po's commentary says that one of the Deng's great feats
 and historic contributions is to put forward the principle of
"one country, two systems", aimed at peaceful reunification of
China. Under the guidance of this strategic concept, Hong Kong is
undergoing smooth transition and will return to the motherland in
less than five months' time, say the Chinese paper.
</P>
<P>
The article finally says that the great man did not only belong
 to China, but also belonged to the world since the rejuvenation
of China is a great contribution to the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Immortal is Deng Xiaoping, the son of the Chinese
people", Ta Kung Pao's commentary praises Deng as the general
architect of China's reform and opening policy and modernization
process, and the founder of the theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics. The article says that Hong Kong people
are grateful to Deng because his scientific concept of "One
country, two systems" has laid down a solid basis for the
long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The paper also says that under the support of Deng, China has
formed the third-generation leadership with President Jiang Zemin
at the core. The group of new leaders has adhered to Deng's
political line and demonstrated the capability in reining the
general situation.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Saddened by Deng's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I really want to express heartfelt sorrow, all the more
because his existence was great," Hashimoto was quoted Kyodo News
as saying at his official residence.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I think his line has been bequeathed to the present
China. We should make mutual efforts to promote this relationship."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister hailed Deng's achievements in
creating the foundations of the current stable relationship
between the two countries, which he said were handed down to the
existing generations, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Deng contributed to developing China as a leader in one era and
enhancing its status in the international community with his
reform and open-door policy, Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Hashimoto said in a statement released by
his office, "I have learned with profound sadness of the death of
his excellency Deng Xiaoping."
</P>
<P>
Deng not only drew up and promoted China's modernization
policy, but also made "great accomplishments" in the development
of friendly and cooperative relations between Japan and China, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister specifically praised Deng's role in
concluding the 1978 bilateral peace and amity treaty between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Deng's visits to Japan in 1978 and 1979 showed the
importance the Chinese leader placed on "developing relations with
our country and increasing mutual understanding."
</P>
<P>
"Amid major changes in the international situation, good
Japan-China relations have become more and more important for
peace and stability, not only in the Asia-Pacific region but also
in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I will continue, while cooperating with Chinese leaders, to
make further efforts for the lasting and stable development of the
friendly relations between Japan and China," Hashimoto said.

Entitled "Immortal is Deng Xiaoping, the son of the Chinese
people", Ta Kung Pao's commentary praises Deng as the general
architect of China's reform and opening policy and modernization
process, and the founder of the theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics. The article says that Hong Kong people
are grateful to Deng because his scientific concept of "One
country, two systems" has laid down a solid basis for the
long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The paper also says that under the support of Deng, China has
formed the third-generation leadership with President Jiang Zemin
at the core. The group of new leaders has adhered to Deng's
political line and demonstrated the capability in reining the
general situation.

</P>
<P>
This came in a presidential statement in which he said he was
saddened to learn of the 93-year-old Deng's death.

<P>
"Over the past two decades, Mr. Deng was an extraordinary
figure on the world stage and the driving force behind China's
decision to normalize relations with the United States," Clinton

The "historic visit" by Deng to the United States in 1979,

relations and cooperation" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Deng's long life spanned a century of turmoil, tribulation
and remarkable change in China," Clinton said. "He spurred China's
historic economic reform program, which greatly improved living
standards in China and modernized much of the nation."
</P>
<P>
Clinton stressed, "China today plays an important role in world
affairs in no small part because of Mr. Deng's decision to open
his country to the outside world."

Meanwhile, Clinton expressed his condolences to Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and to the Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Investigate Nuclear Waste Dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Environment Minister
Ziyaettin Tokar has announced that his ministry would investigate
the allegations that nuclear waste from Germany was buried in
Turkey in 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
The allegations by former director of the Turkish Atomic Energy
Agency (TAEK) Ahmet Yuksel Ozemre said that about 1,150 tonnes of
 nuclear waste from Germany had been buried in Isparta,
southwestern Turkey, and another 800 tonnes in the central
Anatolian city of Konya, local newspaper Daily News reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Tokar said the Environment Ministry was trying to contact
Ozemre to specify when he said so and an expert team was
preparing to leave for the two cities for investigations.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking into Ozemre's claims. If we discover a
problem, we will impose sanctions on the country the waste was
transferred from and those responsible for this would be
punished," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey started a ban on nuclear waste shipment into the
country in 1994.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Turkish authorities concerned generally
think that Ozemre's allegations are suspectful.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted TAEK director Mehmet Ergin as saying that
he thought it was unlikely to prove the truth of Ozemre's
claims.
</P>
<P>
If the investigations failed to justify the allegations,
Ozemre will face the accusations himself, Ergin added.

JOHANNESBURG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
opposition National Party (NP) leader F. W. de Klerk has
announced a major restructuring of the party's top leadership in
a bid to establish a new political movement, said source here
today.
</P>
<P>
The shake-up, made at an emergency federal council meeting in
Cape Town on Wednesday, included the disbandment of the NP's
secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NP's Secretary-General Roelf Meyer was once again
asked by De Klerk to head a task team whose sole function would
be to establish a possible realignment in South Africa's
opposition politics.
</P>
<P>
The NP, a ruling party since 1948, became South Africa's
official opposition party in May last year when it withdrew from
the African National Congress-led government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
NP's Wednesday reshuffle also includes a set-up of a separate
task team, headed by Assistant Secretary-General Marthinus Van
Schalkwyk, to concentrate on building the NP and improving its
image.
</P>
<P>
NP Executive Director Fanus Schoeman was named as political
head in De Klerk's office to act as a link between the task teams
and the party's federal structures.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said the NP would remain a "vibrant force" after the
shake-up and would not "disband into a void".

<HEADLINE> Indian Industry Growth Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The industrial output of 24
select industries in India grew only 4.8 percent during the first
nine months of the 1996-97 fiscal year compared with 10.3 percent
in the corresponding period last year, the Times of India said
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the official data issued on Wednesday as
saying that the industrial growth rate for the whole fiscal year
of 1995-96 is 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 24 industries have a weight of 50.37 percent in the overall
index of industrial production and include electricity, cement,
cars, sugar, crude petroleum, cloth and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate in the output of infrastructure industries has
also slumped to 3.3 percent during April-December 1996. It was 8.8
percent in the previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
If industries with a weight of 50.37 percent showed a growth
rate of 4.8 percent, an Indian economist said, in order to achieve
an overall growth rate of 10 percent in 1996-97, the rest of the
industrial sector would have to grow at more than 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has maintained that overall industrial
growth rate will be double-digit during the current fiscal year
from April 1996 to March 1997.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliamentary Re-Elections End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 20 (Xinhua)-- Kuwait's parliamentary
re-elections, which were aimed to elect two of the three
candidates in the 21st Constituency to the 50-member National
Assembly, completed Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The re-elections ended a controversy for months over the
legality of the two parliamentary members elected last October in
the nation's general elections.
</P>
<P>
The two winners, former MP Walid Al-Jeri and new face Khaled
Al-Adwa won the victory with 3,854 votes and 3,804 votes
respectively, while Saadoun Hammad Al-Oteibi, who was defeated in
the October election, lost again with 3545 votes.
</P>
<P>
The elections were called after the Kuwaiti Constitutional
Court, the supreme court in the small Gulf state, accepted the
contestation of the previous results, which was filed by
candidate Al-Oteibi.
</P>
<P>
The October election results gave victory to candidate Walid
Al-Jeri (3,379 votes) and Khaled Al-Adwa (3,359 votes) while
Al-Oteibi got 3,242 votes.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled in a verdict on January 11 that the election
of Islamist parliamentary members Khaled Al-Adwalh and Waleed
Al-Jeri were illegal as 193 voters illegally cast their ballots
in the 21st constituency either because they were not residents
in the area or because they were servicemen. Therefore, the court
ordered the re-elections.
</P>
<P>
Military servicemen, governmental functionaries, women and male
citizens under the age of 18 are not allowed to vote in
the country which has the only parliament in the Gulf
region.
</P>
<P>
About 110,000 eligible Kuwaiti voters exercised their
franchise on October 7, 1996, to elect the 8th National
Assembly from 25 constituencies across the country.

<HEADLINE> Singapore External Trade Up Marginally in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total external
trade increased marginally by 0.4 percent in January on a
three-month moving average basis at current prices, registering
the third consecutive month of positive growth, the Singapore
Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's non-oil domestic exports declined by 4.2
percent in January, while re-exports rose by 0.5 percent and oil
domestic exports increased by 18.1 percent in the month, the TDB
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that on a monthly basis, the total trade was flat in
January this year, with non-oil domestic exports remaining
"volatile".
</P>
<P>
The TDB said that the non-oil domestic exports recorded a
decline of 3.1 percent in January following a marginal fall of 0.5
percent in December 1996 and 8.8 percent decline in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, re-exports decreased by 1.7 percent, while the
growth in domestic exports of oil moderated to 7.6 percent in the
wake of four consecutive months of double-digit growth, it said.
</P>
<P>
For exports breakdowns, non-oil domestic exports decreased by
4.2 percent to a level of 7.4 billion Singapore dollars (about
5.29 billion US dollars) in January, as exports to the United
States, Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong remained weak in the month.
</P>
<P>
Oil domestic exports recorded a growth of 18.1 percent to reach
1.5 billion Singapore dollars (about 1.07 billion US dollars) in
January as the growth came from an increase in oil price. In
volume terms exports fell by 0.8 percent as oil exports to China
through Hong Kong slowed, it said.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports increased marginally by 0.5 percent to a level of
6.2 billion Singapore dollars (about 4.43 billion US dollars) in
January, reflecting increases in re-exports of disk drives,

<HEADLINE> Ads Removed from Shanghai's Weather Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- When Shanghai's meteorology
bureau opened a special "121" phone line to provide weather
information, it also inserted three advertisements to cover the
expense of the service.
</P>
<P>
But the people of Shanghai expressed their displeasure, with
some residents complaining of being bombarded by three ads when
all they really wanted was just a small piece of information.
</P>
<P>
So, the ads were cut down to just one, until the telephone
bureau made the decision to cancel them completely.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, Shanghai said it welcomed local
residents' comments about the telephone bureau's services, and
many residents said that it was unfair for them to pay just to
listen to ads. Other people said they were not pleased to have to
listen to an ad saying, "Your stomach feels uncomfortable? Drink
X or Y!", so the ad was rewritten to read, "If your stomach feels
uncomfortable, please drink X or Y," but the results were the same.
</P>
<P>
As a kind of public service, the weather report should not look
for financial return, but for social effect, said an official of
the telephone bureau. He went on to explain that once the service
begins to satisfy people, its increased use will make "121"
profitable.

<HEADLINE> China's Capital Focusing On Low-Income Family Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Jia Qinglin, the acting mayor
of Beijing, told a session of the local legislature recently that
the city government will attempt to create more jobs and improve
salaries and income through accelerated economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said the standard of living and culture will be improved,
urban and rural areas coordinated, and the income gap between
different social groups dealt with.
</P>
<P>
According to the local labor bureau, low-income means the
following: working for a money-losing company; living below the
poverty line; being laid-off, jobless, or retired; being poor in
rural or remote regions; and being poor even on a temporary basis.
</P>
<P>
Jia noted that some state-owned enterprises in Beijing are
having difficulties and that there are still 140,000 to 150,000
laid-off workers, meaning a lot of work if the municipal
government is to help them make their two ends meet.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, some 30,000 laid-off workers have
received technical training, and 43,900 unemployed and 38,000
laid-off workers have gotten new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Jia pointed out that the government will speed up its
"Re-employment Project" to find jobs for 60 percent of the
laid-off workers and to keep the unemployment rate to below two
percent in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 1996, the city started a "minimum income guarantee
system", setting it at 170 yuan (about 20 US dollars) a month and
later the lowest monthly salary raised to 270 yuan. By the end of
last year, 45,000 people benefited from the system.
</P>
<P>
Of 60 important issues that the government will deal with in
1997, eleven involve low-incomes and people's daily lives.

<HEADLINE> Ousted Ecuadoran President Offers "Conspiracy" Tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Deposed Ecuadoran
President Abdalal Bucaram today revealed a tape which he claimed
contains a conversation between "conspirators" planning to remove
him from power.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in the Panamanian capital,
Bucaram said the police and military took part in what he called a
"coup d'etat" to overthrow him early this month.
</P>
<P>
Without providing any details of the recording, he said that
15,000 municipal employees, "with the help of several members of
the police", effectively trapped him in the presidential palace
after Congress voted to oust him and swore in its leader Fabian
Alarcon on February 6.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram said a tiny group of joint command servicemen assisted
in the coup, telling him the situation was unsustainable and
demanding his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram, popularly known as "El Loco" (madman), was removed
from office by Congress on the grounds of "mental incompetence."
He has rejected the move as "unconstitutional".
</P>
<P>
However, he left the Carondelet palace on February 7 after riot
police clashed with demonstrators who threatened to take the
palace by force.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, during his stopover in Colombia as part of his bid
to drum up support among Latin American countries, Bucaram said
that he would have been assassinated if he had refused to leave
the palace in Quito.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram started his tour in Panama on February 11, the day
Alarcon was sworn in as acting president. Alarcon will run the
country until 1998 when new elections are held.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram said Wednesday that he will issue a report confirming
the existence of a plot to drive him out of government just six
months after he was elected president in July, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Panama, Argentina and Colombia had voiced support for
him as the only legitimate Ecuadoran president and rejecting
Alarcon.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, when Bucaram returned to Panama from Colombia,
Panamanian Foreign Minister Ricardo Arias said Panama welcomed
Bucaram to stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister said earlier Panama does not recognize the
government of Fabian Alarcon as that would necessitate the
breaking off of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
He said Panama continued to watch the Ecuadoran situation with
great concern.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram is to travel to Bolivia Friday to meet with President
Gonzalo Lozada.

<HEADLINE> EX-Gurkhas' Group Hails Britain's Decision on Equal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- An ex-Gurkha soldiers' group
in Nepal has welcomed Britain's decision to pay same salaries to
serving Gurkha soldiers in the British Army as their British
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Padma Gurung, Chairman of the Ex-Gurkha Association here, said
Wednesday that Britain's decision has effectively removed the
mercenary stigma of Gurkha recruitment in Nepal for the British
Army.
</P>
<P>
British Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames Monday announced
before the British House of Commons a one-million-pound package
for Gurkha soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that from July all Gurkha soldiers on a
three-year duty to Britain will be accompanied by their families.
</P>
<P>
He told the House that the development recognizes and gives
substance to the Gurkha position as an integral and valued
component of the British Army.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ex-Gurkha Association here Wednesday urged the
British government to make similar arrangements to solve the
welfare problems of thousands of retired Gurkha soldiers in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Retired Gurkhas here have demanded same pensions as retired
British servicemen, working opportunities for their children and
rights to live in Britain from the British government.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba took up the
Ex-Gurkhas' welfare demands with his British counterpart John
Major last November during his visit to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Deuba recently said that he is confident that Britain will
declare a solution to the problems of ex-Gurkhas in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nepali Embassy in London, of the 3,400-man
Gurkha Brigade of the British Army, 2,386 are based in Britain,
830 in Brunei and about 100 still in Hong Kong at present.
</P>
<P>
The final batch of Gurkha soldiers in Hong Kong will be
transferred to Britain before the territory returns to China by
July this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
During over 180-year-history of the Gurkha Brigade, hundreds
and thousands of Nepali soldiers, mostly from poverty-stricken
mountainous regions in northern Nepal, had served in the British
Army and about 15,000 of them lost their lives in World War I and
II.

<P>
OTTAWA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada reaped a record trade
surplus of 25.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, well above the 21
billion dollars level in 1995, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Exports value in 1996 rose by 5.3 percent to a total of 197.6
billion dollars and that of imports by 3.4 percent to 172.4

</P>
<P>
The report said that the increase in exports resulted mainly
from the growth in the sales of machinery, energy products and
lumber.
</P>
<P>
But the fall in the prices of pulp and paper, Canada's
traditional export products, in the international market affected
the overall gains in exports, the report pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Reforms Save FAO 25 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Rome-based United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said today ongoing reforms
are saving the organization at least 25 million U.S. dollars a
year.
</P>
<P>
A report said the reforms, including the elimination of many
posts, travel cost reductions, fewer and shorter meetings and
fewer publications, made the FAO a significantly slimmed-down and
re-focused organization.
</P>
<P>
The FAO had cut 456 positions throughout the organization by
mid-1996, out of a total staff of 4,185 three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The FAO Director-General, Jacques Diouf, said: "The reform
program has broadened the FAO's links embracing the private sector
and non-governmental organizations (NGO), leading to the creation
of the Unit for Cooperation with the private sector and NGOs."
This would expand contacts with associations and companies and
develop prototype cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
He noted the reform program had been unanimously approved by
the FAO's governing conference both in 1993 and 1996.

</P>
<P>
Directors and managers in Shanghai say they hope to become

<P>
Fudan University, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Tongji

degree requirements call for 50 credits, and most people complete
their studies in two and a half years or three years, taking
courses of marketing, international management, finance, and
science, technology, and information industry administration.
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing these courses and lectures by
well-known foreign business people, the universities also make
students analyze real cases and let them participate in

Fudan and the US's Massachusetts Institute of Technology
have a joint program promoting the MBA in China.
</P>
<P>
Major corporations like Shanghai Coca Cola, Bell Telephone, and

<P>
BUCHAREST, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Romania will join the
Central Europe Free Trade Zone (CEFTZ) in July, becoming the trade
bloc's sixth member, a foreign ministry spokesman said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Gilda Lazar said at a press conference that Romania
and five CEFTZ member countries had agreed on the final documents
for an accord following the last round of talks in Ljubljana,
capital of Slovenia, on February 13-14.
</P>
<P>
The CEFTZ, set up in 1992 and now comprising the Czech
Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia, also agreed on
protocols allowing Romania into CEFTZ markets for industrial and
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Commerce ministers of Romania and CEFTZ member countries will
sign the documents by April 10, Lazar said.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Minister of Trade and Industry Mircea Roader said in a
statement published in a local newspaper on February 13 that
joining the CEFTZ would enable Romania to expand its foreign trade
through a gradual reduction of tariffs on industrial products.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hungary would be Romania's main trade partner in
the CEFTZ since the country currently accounts for half of
Romania's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Toader said Romania is expected to sign a free trade accord
with Bulgaria at the end of this month and another one with Turkey
is under negotiation.

NEW YORK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Toronto Raptors coach
Darrell Walker's action of slamming the ball to the court at the
end of his club's 103-105 loss to the Indiana Pacers caused a

following his ejection with one-tenth of a second remaining.
</P>
<P>
The Raptors led 103-102 with 1.8 seconds left when the Pacers
inbounded the ball to Reggie Miller, who tried a
three-pointer. Toronto guard Doug Christie blocked the shot but
was called for a foul, giving Miller three free throws.

<HEADLINE> OAS Legal Committee To Analyze Ecuadoran Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The political situation in
Ecuador, which recently ousted its former president, will be
analyzed by a seminar to be held this Friday by the Organization
of American States (OAS).
</P>
<P>
The OAS Secretary General, Cesar Gaviria and Eduardo Vio, the
Chilean chairman of the Inter-American Legal Committee of that
organization, will be the key speakers at the forum, "Democracy in
the Inter-American system," said Chile's foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
The forum, organized by the Inter-American Legal Committee,
will be attended by representatives of all the OAS states and
special guests.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Ecuador will inevitably follow the recent
ousting of Abdala Bucaram as president of that country.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-American Legal Committee of the OAS will hand down an
opinion from a study made by its chairman who traveled to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The study confirms that OAS member states have an international
and legal obligation to the OAS to exercise representative
democracy effectively.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, the OAS may adopt measures of a political
nature in cases where that obligation is violated so as to procure
the prompt re-establishment of institutionality where it is
breached.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-American Legal Committee is considered the most
important organ in the OAS charter and is the oldest of the system.
</P>
<P>
The main duty of this committee is to promote the progressive
development and the codification, on a legal plane, of
international law in the American continent.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Be Ready for EMU: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Italy will meet the conditions
set by the Maastricht Treaty for European Monetary Union and will
adopt long-lasting measures for economic convergence in public
finance, Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting with visiting Dutch Finance
Minister Gerrit Zalm.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the ministry quoted Ciampi as saying Rome's
principal objective is to ensure that Italy, a founding member of
the European Community, is among the founding countries of the
euro, the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed on the need to respect both the
criteria and the timetable laid out in the Maastricht Treaty
because "any delay from the establishment deadline would cast a
shadow on the credibility of the process towards economic and
monetary union," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting took place within the framework of
consultations the Netherlands is making during its six-month
European Union presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch finance minister is among the firmest supporters of a
strong Euro. But he has in the past openly expressed his doubts
over the ambitions of nations like Italy, Spain and Portugal to
meet EMU requirements in time.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's FDI Approves Increase in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
approved 5.2 billion US dollars of foreign direct investment (FDI)
in January this year, compared with 3.9 billion US dollars in the
same period of last year, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"We approved 80 new foreign direct investment projects worth
5.2 billion US dollars in January," Investment Minister Sanyoto
Sastrowardoyo said Wednesday after attending a seminar on trade
and investment organized by the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia-Pacific (ESCAP) and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Antara news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said foreign investment approvals for 1996
amounted to 959 projects worth 29.9 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia posted its highest level of foreign investment
approvals of 39.9 billion US dollars in 1995 compared with 23.7
billion US dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official of Indonesia's capital investment
coordinating board (BKPM) said that the BKPM has approved both
domestic and foreign investments totaling 21 trillion rupiah (9.1
billion US dollars in January.
</P>
<P>
"The relatively large investment proves that Indonesia is one
of the Asian countries experiencing high investment growth," the
official said on Tuesday in Medan, north Sumatra.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Mostly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar closed mostly
higher today, getting strength from a German central bank report
that cast more uncertainty over Europe's single currency plan.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 1.6963 marks,
up from 1.6839 marks Tuesday. The dollar cost 124.46 yen, up from
123.88 yen. The pound cost 1.6161 U.S. dollars, up from 1.6084
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The dollar once again tested the 1.7000-mark level today, but
quickly retreated.
</P>
<P>
Some investors still see 1.7000 marks as the level where
central banks of the leading industrialized nations might
intervene by selling dollars to keep the U.S. currency from going
higher.
</P>
<P>
News of a widening trade deficit had little impact on the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Tuesday:
1.4825 Swiss francs, up from 1.4699; 5.7260 French francs, up from

<HEADLINE> 2 Charged in Germany for Corruption in Auto Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Two people were charged in the
German city of Braunschweig today for unfair competition and other
irregularities in auto business as the scandal over kickbacks and
extortion in the world car industry deepens.
</P>
<P>
The charges followed detailed information received from the
giant Swedish-Swiss engineering concern Asea Brown Boveri AG in
Mannheim, Germany. The corporation last month alleged extortion of
20 million marks (nearly 12 million U.S. dollars) in link with a
contract with Volkswagen to build a 400 million mark paint plant
at its Czech Skoda unit.
</P>
<P>
The complaint and reports in the latest edition of the German
news weekly Der Spiegel that car industry officials extract bribes
from companies seeking contracts have triggered off legal
investigations in Germany as well as in the United States and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Spiegel Monday said that an international network of car
industry purchasing managers has been paid several hundred million
marks over years from suppliers seeking contracts with auto groups
including Germany's Volkswagen and the giant U.S. car firm General
Motor Corp.
</P>
<P>
According to it, the FBI is already investigating about 120
people on suspicion of taking kickbacks, and among those at the
center of inquiries is Jose Ignacio Lopez, a former GM top
purchasing manager, who defected to VW and was charged by GM for
having stolen company secrets.
</P>
<P>
Lopez was forced to stand down from his top post at VW last
year following GM's allegations.
</P>
<P>
VW itself is now also probing the ABB complaint. On Tuesday, it
announced that it had suspended three executives from the
purchasing department as part of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is also aimed to make clear whether the death
of Ludvig Klama, chief of VW's Czech Skoda unit, was linked to his
discovery of evidence of corruption there. The Skoda boss was
killed in a car crash last November.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Newspaper Employees End 19-Month Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Detroit's newspapers today
accepted a back-to-work offer from striking unions, ending a
19-month-long walkout.
</P>
<P>
The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press said they will bring
back the 2,500 employees including pressmen, truck drivers,
reporters and editors, who went on strike in July 1995 over issues
of wages, work rules, union jurisdiction, job cuts and health
care costs.
</P>
<P>
"Our acceptance of the unconditional offer from the unions
brings this 19-month labor dispute to an end," News editor and
publisher Robert Giles was quoted by the Associated Press as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Giles called it a "positive step," which helped former
strikers.
</P>
<P>
The unions last week began offering to return to work
unconditionally in what they said was a legal maneuver and not a
surrender.
</P>
<P>
Some 450 striking employees went back to work and replacements
were made by the daily newspapers to keep the papers continue
during the strike.

<HEADLINE> German Central Banker Dismisses Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- German central bank president
Hans Tietmeyer today rejected criticism that the bank's
price-stabilizing policy has contributed to the country's sluggish
economy.
</P>
<P>
In response to two economic reports published today predicting
that the German economy would remain stagnant, an economic expert
of the German opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), Ernst
Schwanhold, unleashed criticism at the central bank Bundesbank,
saying that it had single-mindedly pursued its long-standing
policy of price control.
</P>
<P>
"The real interest rate level in Germany is still too high,"
Schwanhold said. He urged the Bundesbank to lower its key interest
rates further.
</P>
<P>
In response, Tietmeyer said that Bundesbank's policy had
provided stability for the German industry, low interest rates and
thus favorable conditions for investment.
</P>
<P>
If the central bank policy had been different, Germany would
currently be confronted with even greater difficulties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer did not rule out the possibility of further cuts in
interest rates, but he pointed out that the current rates were
already at a historic low and therefore did not constitute an
obstacle to further economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Economic Institutes Paint Grim Picture for German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Adding up to the great
disappointment aroused by a post-war record unemployment, two
economic reports issued by the German central bank and a leading
economic institute today again dimmed people's hope for any major
growth in the German economy in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of the German Economy (DIW) in Berlin said in its
latest economic forecast report that it was revising its January
projection of a slight increase for the German economy and now
expected a gross domestic product (GDP) decline of 0.25 percent in
the first quarter of 1997 compared with the last quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the DIW, one of Germany's six leading independent
economic research institutes, Germany's industry orders had
dropped both at home and from abroad. Other disappointing data
include a post-war record of nearly 4.66 million unemployed in
January, a decline in domestic demand for capital investment goods
and a further fall in private consumption.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report for February issued today, the German
central bank also painted a grim picture, mentioning the overall
stagnation in the fourth quarter of 1996, declining consumption, a
recession in the building sector and sluggish investments.
</P>
<P>
The central bank urged the government to implement its tax and
social welfare reforms which aimed at improving companies
competitively as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Creating security in this area quickly could considerably
contribute to increasing the investment activity of companies and
thereby create new jobs," the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Germany's GDP registered virtually
zero growth and possibly a decline in the last quarter of 1996
when compared with the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics of the DIW put the German GDP growth for
1996 as a whole at a real 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
For 1997, it said that it was still unclear whether German
economy would register another decline in the second quarter, thus
dropping into a recession. "All depend on the development of
export," the DIW said.

WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
provide 10 million dollars in food aid to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) in response to an appeal by the United
Nations, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said in a statement that "the United

The United States will provide corn-soy blend for children

the State Department said in the statement flooding in 1995 and
1996 had destroyed considerable farm land resulting in "widespread
food shortages and malnutrition."

U.S. officials said Japan and South Korea will also provide the
bulk of the remaining food assistance to the DPRK.

<P>
The death of Comrade Deng Xiaoping is an immeasurable loss to
our Party, our army and the people of various ethnic groups
throughout the country, and will certainly cause tremendous grief
among the Chinese people. The Party Central Committee calls on the
whole Party, the whole army and the people of various ethnic
groups to turn grief into strength, carry forward Comrade Deng
Xiaoping's behest and express our mourning with our concrete
actions in redoubling our efforts to do work well in various
aspects.
</P>
<P>
We must unswervingly adhere to the Party's basic line set by
Comrade Deng Xiaoping for us since the Third Plenum of the 11th
Party Central Committee, persist in taking economic construction
as the central task, carry out the economic restructuring and the
system reforms in other areas, adhere to the opening up to the
outside world and the four cardinal principles. Under the guidance
of this line, we must pioneer new undertakings, surmount all kinds
of difficulties, withstand various storms and constantly push
forward the socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
We must uphold and safeguard Party's unity and unification,
unite more conscientiously around the Party Central Committee with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, and strengthen Party's

the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, develop
the broad patriotic united front, strengthen the great unity among
the people of various ethnic groups throughout the country,
safeguard social stability, work hard and build the country
thriftily.
</P>
<P>
We must adhere to the independent foreign policy of peace,
actively develop friendly relations with various countries in the
world on the basis of Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existance,
and contribute to safeguarding world peace, promoting world
development, opposing hegemonism and power politics, and
establishing a new international political order and a new
international economic order.
</P>
<P>
We must conscientiously study Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, learn from
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's revolutionary style and his scientific
attitude and creative spirit in applying Marxist stand, viewpoints
and methods to studying new circumstances and solving new
problems, and strive to build our country into a powerful,
prosperous, democratic and civilized modern socialist country.
</P>
<P>
Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, the whole Party, the whole army
and the people of various ethnic groups all over the country,
holding high the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, firm and unshakable and
full of confidence, will certainly be able to carry out the great
cause of the socialist reform, opening up and modernization drive
pioneered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and triumphantly reach our
destination.
</P>

Eternal glory to Comrade Deng Xiaoping!

<HEADLINE> Former East German Spies on Trial for Giving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Four members of the former East
German intelligence service Stasi were on trial in a Berlin court
today for giving refuge to 10 top members of the terrorist Red
Army Faction (RAF) between 1980 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
They were charged with undermining justice for providing the
RAF terrorists with new East German identity documents, false
curriculum vitaes and financial support.
</P>
<P>
However, one of the accused, Harry Dahl, the former head of the
anti-terrorism unit of the Stasi, said West German authorities
were informed and from remarks made by one of his superiors, "an
understanding had been reached between Erich Honecker (former East
German leader) and the chancellor (of West Germany)."
</P>
<P>
He told the court that by giving refuge to the terrorists,
"further crimes were prevented." According to him, the provision
of refuge was on condition that the terrorists would not carry out
attacks in East Germany and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Under the German unification accord, the accused might not be
sentenced as they did not commit a crime according to the then
East German law. The defense described the proceedings as
"irrelevant."
</P>
<P>
Among the RAF leaders going underground in the former East
Germany were also Susanne Albrecht, Silke Mayer-Witt and Inge
Viett, who were sought by West German police in link with the
killing in 1977 of two top personnel of the Dresdner Bank.

<P>
To achieve peaceful reunification of the motherland in line
with the concept of "one country, two systems" is a significant
creation in the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics. In accordance with Sino-British and
Sino-Portuguese agreements, Hong Kong is returning to the
motherland soon and Macao will return to the motherland in
1999. The Taiwan question will be solved in the end, and the
complete reunification of the motherland will surely be achieved.
</P>
<P>
An important aspect of the theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics is the analysis of the international
situation and the policy decisions concerning China's
international strategy. Involved are the readjustment of the
relations with Japan, the United States and the former Soviet
Union, development of friendly relations with neighbouring
countries and third world countries and opening up of a new
situation in China's foreign relations, thus creating a favorable
environment for the country to concentrate its effirts on the
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics has gradually taken shape and developed under the
historical conditions in which peace and development are the theme
of our times, and in the course of China's practise of reform,
opening-up and socialist modernization, by summing up the
historical experiences of socialism in China including both
victories and setbacks while drawing on the historical lessons of
other socialist countries which had experienced rises and falls,
successes and defeats.
</P>
<P>
In the world scope, how the proletariat will build socialism
after it leads the people to seize political power is a key
historical topic demanding thorough summing-up and exploration. By
means of historical comparison and international observation, the
new situation and new achievements of socialism in China make us
realize that Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics is correct.
</P>
<P>
This theory has scientifically grasped the essence of
socialism, and for the first time answered in a fairly systematic
way a series of basic questions of how to build, consolidate and
develop socialism in a country like China with comparatively
backward economy and culture.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes National Campaign Against Juvenile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today proposed a national campaign against juvenile crime, warning
that America "is going to be living with chaos" unless the problem
is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the University of Massachusetts, Clinton proposed
495 million U.S. dollars for the two-year campaign, of which 200
million dollars will be used for state and local anti-gang
prosecution initiatives, 60 million dollars for 1,000 new
after-school programs to keep kids off the streets and 75 million
dollars for anti-truancy, school violence and crime intervention.
</P>
<P>
Taking the opportunity, Clinton also proposed to expand the
reach of the Brady law and called for a ban on handgun sales to
those 18 or older who had been convicted of a felony as a
juvenile.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said fighting juvenile crime "has got to become our top
law enforcement priority."
</P>
<P>
He said 95 percent of America's largest cities and 88 percent
of the smaller cities are plagued by gang crime. The number of
people arrested for violent crimes will double by 2010 "unless we
do something about it," he warned.
</P>
<P>
"We know we've got about six years to turn this juvenile crime
thing around or our country is going to be living with chaos,"
said Clinton.

The theory is the product of combining the basic theory of
Marxism and Leninism and the actual conditions and characteristics
of contemporary China, the inheritance and development of Mao
Zedong Thought. It is Marxism in Modern China, the crystallization
of the collective wisdom of the entire Party and the people in the
whole nation, the guiding thought of the CPC and the spiritual
pillar of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Without Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory, there would not be the
new situation of reform and opening up in China today, and there
would not be the bright future of China's socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
Long time ago, Comrade Deng Xiaoping had advocated the
eradication of life tenure of leading officials, and he himself
had for several times sincerely expressed his wish to retire. It
was agreed according to a decision at the 13th National Congress
of the CPC that he would not be elected into the new CPC Central
Committee and Central Advisory Commission, but he remained
chairman of the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed again according to a decision at the Fifth
Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee that Comrade Deng
Xiaoping resigned from the post as chairman of the Central
Military Commission. Comrade Deng Xiaoping played a decisive role
and created full conditions in promoting the smooth transition
from the second generation of leadership to the third generation
of leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, thus
maintaining the stability of the Party and the country.
</P>
<P>
Though retired from his leading posts, Comrade Deng Xiaoping
paid close attention to reform, opening-up and modernization
drive with high sense of historical responsibility.
</P>
<P>
In his important speech during his inspection tour in southern
China in early 1992, he scientifically summarized the Party's
basic practice and experience since the Third Plenum of the 11th
CPC Central Committee, theoretically and profoundly answered many
key questions of understanding, which had been perplexing and
binding people's mind for a long time, especially the question
concerning the relationship between socialism and market
economy. The speech not only is an important guidance for the 14th
CPC National Congress, but also has far reaching significance to
the entire socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Characterized by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech in the south
and the 14th CPC National Congress, China's socialist reform,
opening-up and modernization drive have entered a new stage. In
1993, 89-year-old Comrade Deng Xiaoping was personally in charge
of compiling the third volume of Selected Works of Deng
Xiaoping. The third and second volumes of Selected Works of Deng
Xiaoping include the major creative works of Comrade Deng Xiaoping
in forming and developing his theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, which is the scientific guide for our
advance to victory.

After the Party's 14th National Congress, the party's central
committee with comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has held high the
banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and led the whole Party, Army and people
of all ethnic groups in China, in line with the arrangements of
the 14th Congress, in grasping the opportunity to deepen the
reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain the
country's stability. While centering on the economic construction,
the central committee has also consistently adhered to promoting
cultural and ethical progress. The national economy has enjoyed a
sustained, fast and healthy growth and the second strategic target
of the "three-step strategy" set by comrade Deng Xiaoping has been
realized ahead of time. Major new achievements have been scored
in the country's economic and social development. At present,
every sector is doing a good job to greet the convening of the
Party's 15th National Congress.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng Xiaoping formed a distinctive revolutionary style
through long years of revolutionary practice. He valued practice
and had a keen political insight to seize opportunities in the
development of the times. He was able to both carry on the cause
of his forerunners and break free from conventions. He learned
from the experiences of other countries without copying others'
development models. He always tried to sum up new experience,
create new methods and look for new ways based on the reality of
China and development trend of the contemporary world. He
respected the ordinary people and always paid attention to the
interest and wishes of the masses. When he worked out policies and
made decisions, he would see that they help boost the productive
forces of the socialist society, enhance the country's
