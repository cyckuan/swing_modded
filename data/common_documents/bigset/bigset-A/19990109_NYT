QUESTIONS, ANSWERS ON HOLMGREN'S HIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question: Will the hiring of Mike Holmgren get the Seahawks back
on ``Monday Night Football'' for the first time since 1992?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The NFL schedule won't be released until late March or
early April, but the Seahawks do play at Green Bay next season and
you know ABC will be lobbying to get Holmgren's return in prime
time. How about the Seahawks vs. the Packers on the first Monday
night of the season?
</P>
<P>
   Question: Does Holmgren's hiring set the table for the return of
quarterback Rick Mirer? Mirer, who the Seahawks drafted with the
No. 2 overall pick in the 1993 NFL draft, has been Holmgren's pet
project in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: No. No. No. A thousand times, no.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Will Holmgren fill his staff with Packer assistants,
or retain some of the Seahawks assistants who remain under
contract?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Both. Holmgren definitely will bring some of his Packer
assistants with him. But it is likely that he also will retain at
least one or two of the Seahawk assistants. Also count on him
bringing in an assistant or two from other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Question: With Holmgren getting the dual title of executive vice
president/general manager and head coach, what does that mean for
Randy Mueller, the club's vice president of football operations who
has been handling the duties of a general manager without the
title?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Nothing. As club president Bob Whitsitt put it:
``Randy's still Randy. Instead of reporting to Dennis (Erickson),
he reports to Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: What did Holmgren's hiring do for season-ticket sales?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The Seahawks ticket office sold 275 new season-ticket
packages in the first three hours after Holmgren was hired. The
total reached 848 by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Thursday night's dinner at the Mercer Island estate of
owner Paul Allen was the piece de resistance in landing Holmgren.
Just what does a multi-billionaire serve for dinner?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: As Holmgen offered: ``As the dinner went along, each
course was described. But it was described in French, so I had no
idea what I was eating. It was pretty good, though.''

TWO OLYMPICS ORGANIZERS QUIT IN SALT LAKE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for complete rewrite, to clarify and restructure, including
moving up info. on impact of resignations on sponsors and adding
details to ID of J.W. Marriott.) 
(ATTN: Utah)  (js) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The top two local organizers of the 2002 Winter
Olympics resigned Friday as new details continued to emerge in a
mushrooming bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two, Frank Joklik, resigned under pressure as
president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, and Joklik asked
for the resignation of the other, Dave Johnson, the senior vice
president of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik, 70, has not been linked to the scandal and will remain
in his position until a successor is found. The pressure came from
Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah, a member of the board of trustees of the
Salt Lake Organizing Committee, and U.S. Olympic officials, who
were concerned about public embarrassment and about wavering
confidence by corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Anita DeFrantz, a member of the International Olympic Committee,
indicated Friday that some members of the committee would be
pressured to resign when it meets later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal became public last November when a Salt Lake City
television station received a copy of a letter from Johnson to the
daughter of an IOC member from Cameroon, stating that a $10,000
tuition payment would be her last. Johnson has refused to talk with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik acknowledged for the first time that the Salt Lake City
bid committee had taken these improper actions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Provided free health care to IOC members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aided an IOC member in a profitable Utah land deal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Made direct cash payments _ apparently about $70,000 in one
case _ to ``a number'' of IOC members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, officials of the Salt Lake City committee had
acknowledged that the bid committee had paid housing, travel and
education expenses to relatives of members of the IOC and had given
them expensive gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Thursday
that the payments ranged from $5,000 to $70,000 and had been made
to IOC members from Africa and Latin America. On Friday they said
that Jean-Claude Ganga, an IOC member from Congo Republic, had
received a series of payments totaling approximately $70,000 before
the vote in June 1995 in which Salt Lake City won the 2002 Winter
Games. The investigators said that there did not appear to be any
justifiable reason for the payments but that they were still being
examined. Efforts to reach Ganga Friday and in recent weeks were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik also announced Friday that a monthly $10,000 consulting
fee paid to the former president of the Salt Lake City organizing
committee, Tom Welch, would be discontinued. Welch headed the bid
committee that secured the Games and resigned his Olympic position
in 1997 after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor charge of
spousal battery. Welch and Johnson were the two most visible
members of the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Two other employees of the local organizing committee took
administrative leave pending the outcome of the inquiry: Kelly
Flint, senior vice president for marketing and legal affairs, and
Rod Hamson, the licensing director, who worked as finance director
of the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik said he was ``deeply dismayed'' by the disclosures of
recent weeks and felt that it was necessary to resign to give the
organizing committee a chance to make a fresh start with the Games
only three years away.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation was welcomed by the U.S. Olympic Committee,
which still must raise more than $250 million in a joint marketing
effort with Salt Lake City to achieve the privately financed budget
of $1.45 billion for the 2002 Winter Games. Corporate sponsors have
become jittery in recent weeks as details of the scandal became
public, and US West even withheld a $5 million sponsorship payment.
</P>
<P>
   Without Friday's resignations to signal to sponsors that the
scandal was being handled quickly and thoroughly, it would have
been ``extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, to raise funds
necessary for these Games,'' said John Krimsky Jr., the USOC's
chief fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   While an international search will be conducted for Joklik's
replacement, some names being mentioned here include these
potential candidates:
</P>
<P>
   _ Dave Checketts, the chief executive officer of Madison Square
Garden, a native of Utah whose name surfaced as a possible
replacement for Welch in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jon M. Huntsman Jr., vice chairman of Huntsman Chemical Corp.
</P>
<P>
   _ J.W. Marriott Jr., chairman and chief executive of Marriott
International, the hotel company.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brent Scowcroft, the former national security adviser to
President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   _ David P. Gardner, the former president of the University of
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   _ Henry Marsh, a former Olympic steeple-chaser.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz, one of two members of the IOC from the United States,
said here Friday that some IOC members involved in the Salt Lake
City scandal would be asked to resign at a meeting Jan. 23 and 24
at the committee's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. The IOC
also reiterated Friday that it would not take the 2002 Games away
from Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if any heads would roll at the international committee,
DeFrantz said, ``I don't think we will have executions, but we will
have fewer members.'' It was the strongest indication yet from the
IOC that some of its 114 members would be pressured to relinquish
their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few individuals who have abused their privilege,''
DeFrantz said. ``We must have them removed from the Olympic
movement.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   One who has come under scrutiny is Ganga, 64, who holds
influence as the president of the national Olympic committees of
Africa. According to Olympic officials, the Salt Lake City bid
committee targeted African votes in their attempt to win the Games.
Investigators have said that Ganga received free medical treatment
for hepatitis in Salt Lake City during the bid process and profited
in a land deal arranged by Bennie Smith Jr., a member of the bid
committee, several months after the Games were awarded to Salt Lake
City.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga achieved international renown as one of the organizers of
the African boycott of the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal. A former
ambassador to China, he is currently Congo Republic's minister for
tourism, sports and leisure as well as president of the country's
Olympic committee. He was recently removed from the IOC's
commission on new sources of financing.
</P>
<P>
   Unless investigators can prove that Ganga received excessive
payments, gifts or services while acting in his official government
capacity, and not as a member of the IOC, a private organization,
it seems unlikely that Salt Lake City officials would be subjected
to charges of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, said
Jeffrey Weiner, a Miami lawyer who was formerly president of the
national association of criminal defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Four investigations are under way: an internal Salt Lake
Organizing Committee ethics panel, the U.S. Olympic Committee, the
IOC and the U.S.Justice Department. The Justice Department inquiry
is to determine whether any laws were broken in the case, which
escalated last month when Marc Hodler, a senior IOC official from
Switzerland, said that as many as 25 of the 114 members of the
international committee had sold their votes in recent elections to
choose Olympic sites. Hodler has said that Salt Lake City was a
victim of agents who demand exorbitant fees for delivering blocs of
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Salt Lake City ethics panel could be made
public as early as next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Leavitt said that he deplored the misdeeds of the Salt
Lake City bid committee, ``and we revolt at being associated with
them.'' He also sternly criticized a ``sinister and dark corner of
corruption'' in the Olympic movement that exists because of what
the he called a lack of accountability in the IOC. He called on
Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the IOC, to institute
reforms in the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik said that as a member of the Salt Lake City bid committee
he had been unaware of any improper payments. He said the bid
committee's board of trustees had been screened from such
information and had been assured by auditors that all expenditures
were proper.
</P>
<P>
   With the resignations of Joklik and Johnson, 40, Salt Lake City
is now left without the two people who possess the greatest
knowledge in organizing the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Joklik's successor, most of the sports
facilities are completed or are well under construction. Major
projects remaining include enclosing the Olympic speed-skating oval
and constructing the 120-kilometer hill for ski jumping. All sports
facilities are expected to be completed by November 2000 so they
can be tested in competition long before the Games open on Feb. 8,
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reputation has been tarnished around the world,'' Mayor
Deedee Corradini of Salt Lake City said. ``We will make it right
again.'' &QL;

HOLMGREN HIRE A MASTERSTROKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND _ Ring the Bell (Mark). Raise the Rufus (Porter). Beat
down the Doornink (Dan).
</P>
<P>
   Hip hip Herrera (Efren). The Seattle Seahawks no longer wallow
in the Mirer (Rick). They have emerged from the NFL Raible (Steve)
prepared to shoot the Moon (Warren).
</P>
<P>
   In Kirkland Friday, Springs (Shawn) sprung and horns were Tuten
(Rick).
</P>
<P>
   OK, so hyperbole rules the day. What the Heck (Andy). In the
mostly tepid history of the NFL in Seattle, hundreds of names have
come and gone. Most were little noted and not long remembered. None
were the game's biggest.
</P>
<P>
   Until Slash Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president of football operations/general manager/head
coach/prime minister/prom king/lama/ /sheriff-of-Nottingham, the
large man acquired the largest job with the largest salary in the
NFL, at least among those who don't dirty themselves on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   What for? The guy is no Brian Bosworth. His hair is unstriped
and unicolored, fergawdsakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instant respect,'' said Seahawk running back Ricky Watters.
</P>
<P>
   Instant respect. A simple idea, way overemphasized in the jock
world, but something the Seahawks haven't had in a decade, locally
or nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Instant respect isn't cheap. It will cost owner Paul Allen more
than $30 million over eight years, it cost president Bob Whitsitt
some prestige, it cost vice president Randy Mueller some authority,
it cost Dennis Erickson and most of his assistants their coaching
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But from the looks on the faces at the team's headquarters, from
the ringing of the ticket-sales phones, from the buzz throughout
the football nation, instant respect seemed a worthy investment.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the force of Holmgren's accomplishments, personality and
character that the entire franchise bent to accommodate him.
</P>
<P>
   Big money, many years and huge responsibilities for a premier
figure in the business add up to an astonishing, locally
unprecedented commitment to an athletic renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Between Friday and the day of the Behring moving trucks was
almost three years by calendar. But from the standpoint of
progress, the Seahawks have gone abruptly from abacus to laptop.
</P>
<P>
   The swiftness with which the Seahawks moved to yank Holmgren
from the tradition-encrusted Green Bay Packers, who had suffered a
wrenching defeat that ended their season last Sunday, to this
history-free NFL outpost was more than a statement about his
stature in the game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It was a statement about how annoyed the franchise bosses were
during the first two years of Allen's tenure. To the software
crowd, two years is like the passing of a generation. Even by NFL
standards, with 23 teams making the playoffs during Erickson's four
seasons, the Seahawks were slow on the uptake.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very short time, I realized these men like to get things
done,'' Holmgren said of his meetings with Allen, Whitsitt and the
rest. ``That's how I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's the right fit, it's the right fit. You know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt reached the same conclusion in the same short time. In
the year since the Seahawks sought to fill the vacant post of
general manager, he maintained his preference was that one man not
hold both jobs of GM and coach. But his position started to shift
after the regular season ended, when he saw how close Holmgren was
to shoveling out of the frozen tundra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never met Mike Holmgren until Wednesday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Whitsitt had turned over the keys to the whole
football works and headed to Portland, where his NBA Trail Blazers
were emerging from their various lockouts, jails, rehab programs
and paternity suits.
</P>
<P>
   For Whitsitt to make such a reversal, and surrender
responsibility, the fit must have been perfect. For a time during
his presidency of the Sonics, he wore so many hats that his neck
bowed from the weight. His habit is to seek more power, not less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with his intellect and understanding,''
Whitsitt said. ``He seriously thought about doing both jobs. He's
not a guy who just says, `Gee, this sounds neat.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He also made an impression when he admitted not having all the
answers _ something his followers might be surprised to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when I'm interviewing someone, I need to to hear, `I
don't know,''' Whitsitt said. ``He said there were things about
(the dual role) he'd have to learn on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time went on, I really felt comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Not an easy development for a control freak. But whatever
misgivings Whitsitt had were no match for the lack of respect he,
Allen and the rest of the franchise felt about being a backwater
outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perfect organizational structure,'' he said, ``is getting
the best people you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks would appear to be approaching that, from a
committed owner to an aggressive president to a football mastermind
to a talented roster of experienced players.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a thing Friday, watching a man trade in his
cheesehead for a bag of slug bait. Imagine the feeling when the
Seahawks trade third-and-11 for first-in-AFC West.

DISNEY PULLS TAPE FOR SUBLIMINAL SMUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Walt Disney Co., in an embarrassing stumble,
announced Friday that it pulled 3.4 million copies of its
just-released ``The Rescuers'' video, reportedly because it
contains photos of a nude woman's torso on two of its 110,000
frames.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant, which has never previously recalled a
video, said Disney employees discovered the photos, which company
officials would characterize only as something some people might
consider objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   The images had been inserted into the master negative of the
1977 animated movie during production and then transferred onto the
video. The images were not discovered until this week because they
are only visible while viewing the video frame by frame. The video
advances at the rate of 30 frames per second, making one frame
impossible to see unaided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea how the images were placed in the master
originally,'' said Disney spokeswoman Claudia Peters. ``They
weren't visible when the film was shown in theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney, the world's most successful brand in
family oriented entertainment, said in a statement that the videos
were being recalled ``to keep (the company's) promise to families
that they can trust and rely on the Disney brand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rescuers'' involves two mice, Bernard and Miss Bianca, and
their albatross friend Orville trying to save a young girl named
Penny from treasure hunters. Voices include Bob Newhart, Eva Gabor
and Pat Buttram.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rescuers'' was re-released in theaters in 1983 and 1989,
and first released on video in 1992. Disney said the earlier
version of the video does not include the image because it was made
from a different master.
</P>
<P>
   The company is offering refunds through the mail for the new
video, which was being sold at the standard price of $18 to $20 a
copy. It declined to say how much the recall will cost but said it
plans to restock inventories within a short time.
</P>
<P>
   Videotapes cost only a few dollars per copy to duplicate and
analyst Linda Bannister of Edward Jones said she does not expect
the recall to have a material impact on Disney's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``People hold Disney up to a higher standard and expect them to
be near-perfect, so they look at the company with a microscope,''
she said. ``So this will receive a lot more publicity than if it
had happened at another company.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street also shrugged off the development as Disney shares
rose 75 cents in trading Friday to $32.50.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure likely will buttress contentions by some
religious groups that Disney is undeserving of its reputation as a
purveyor of wholesome entertainment. In 1997, the Southern Baptists
Convention announced a boycott of Disney to protest the company's
``gay-friendly'' policies, particularly the ABC-TV series
``Ellen,'' and told its 15 million members to abstain from
purchasing Disney products.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Disney advocates have claimed that other Disney animated
films such as ``The Lion King'' contain subliminal sexual imagery
but Disney has denied those allegations. The Rev. Wiley Drake of
First Baptist Church in Buena Park, an active boycott proponent,
said the latest development is no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there are many people within Disney doing this kind
of thing deliberately,'' he said. ``I don't think it's a practical
joke, but more a part of a deliberate internal agenda from people
inside the company. The list goes on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake cited violence in such Disney-produced films as ``Pulp
Fiction'' and ``Scream,'' ``gay days'' at Walt Disney World and
anti-church and pro-gay attitudes in films, TV shows and books.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO: Customers who bought ``The Rescuers'' video since
its release Tuesday can exchange by mailing it to BVHE, Dept. 100,
1240 E. 230th St., Carson CA 90745. For more details, call (800)
723-4763.

be near-perfect, so they look at the company with a microscope,''
she said. ``So this will receive a lot more publicity than if it
had happened at another company.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street also shrugged off the development as Disney shares
rose 75 cents in trading Friday to $32.50.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure likely will buttress contentions by some
religious groups that Disney is undeserving of its reputation as a
purveyor of wholesome entertainment. In 1997, the Southern Baptists
Convention announced a boycott of Disney to protest the company's
``gay-friendly'' policies, particularly the ABC-TV series
``Ellen,'' and told its 15 million members to abstain from
purchasing Disney products.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Disney advocates have claimed that other Disney animated
films such as ``The Lion King'' contain subliminal sexual imagery
but Disney has denied those allegations. The Rev. Wiley Drake of
First Baptist Church in Buena Park, an active boycott proponent,
said the latest development is no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there are many people within Disney doing this kind
of thing deliberately,'' he said. ``I don't think it's a practical
joke, but more a part of a deliberate internal agenda from people
inside the company. The list goes on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake cited violence in such Disney-produced films as ``Pulp
Fiction'' and ``Scream,'' ``gay days'' at Walt Disney World and
anti-church and pro-gay attitudes in films, TV shows and books.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO: Customers who bought ``The Rescuers'' video since
its release Tuesday can exchange by mailing it to BVHE, Dept. 100,
1240 E. 230th St., Carson CA 90745. For more details, call (800)

DUVAL FIRES 63 TO TAKE LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAPALUA, Hawaii _ According to his girlfriend, David Duval has
been shopping for a new car. And whoever wins the Mercedes
Championships this weekend will be awarded a 1999 Mercedes-Benz SL
500 coupe-roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Duval has been inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Tying the Plantation Course record with a 10-under-par 63 and
continuing a 14-month run of sensational golf, Duval roared to a
five-stroke lead after Friday's second round of the PGA Tour's
opening event.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling away from an elite 30-man field that includes eight of
the top 12 players in the world ranking, Duval had 10 birdies and
no bogeys. He matched the course record of 63 set by Steve Pate in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   After two rounds, Duval stood at 130, 16 under par and five
strokes ahead of Vijay Singh, Fred Funk and Billy Mayfair. But it
will take a lot to catch Duval, who has won seven times since
October 1997, and who enjoyed a superb 1998, when he won four
tournaments, captured the money title and led the tour in scoring
average.
</P>
<P>
   While Duval has been reluctant to accept the title of world's
best player, he believes he can beat anyone, any time, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think of myself, and probably never will, as a
superstar,'' said Duval, a native of Jacksonville, Fla., who turned
27 years old in November. ``Everybody wants to compare me with
Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara. I just don't think in those terms. I do
know how to play this game, though. I really feel I'm pretty good
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's performance moved Duval closer to the $468,000
first-place check and the new Mercedes. When asked about the
possibility that Duval would win the new car, his girlfriend, Julie
McArthur, smiled and said, ``He's been looking for a new car, and
winning a Mercedes would certainly make the decision a lot
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval hit powerful drives and pinpoint approach shots Friday
that consistently left him with makable birdie putts. His longest
was 20 feet, as he made the only par-73 course on the PGA Tour
(7,263 yards) look much shorter.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the tournament has been a breeze for Duval, who also
shot 10 under par at Pebble Beach in 1997 and at Tucson in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Duval started the day six under par, one stroke behind Joe
Durant, Funk, Mayfair and Pate. Durant and Pate both shot 70s and
fell into a tie for fifth at 10 under par. Mayfair and Funk shot
69s to tie Singh, who also had a fine round, shooting a 65.
</P>
<P>
   But Duval was in a class by himself. He started with a 15-foot
putt for birdie at No. 1. At the par-5, 532-yard fifth hole, he
reached the green with a driver and a 2-iron, then two-putted from
about 30 feet for birdie. At the 398-yard No. 6, Duval drove to
just short of the green, chipped to within 10 feet and then made
the putt for birdie. Then, at the par-3, 203-yard eighth hole,
Duval hit a superb 5-iron to within two feet of the cup, then
tapped in for a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   On the back nine, Duval had a birdie at No. 10, hitting a sand
wedge approach shot to within six feet, then making the birdie
putt. He made a 12-foot putt for birdie at No. 12 and a 10-foot
putt for birdie at No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   At the par-5, 555-yard No. 15, Duval hit his second shot just
short of the green, chipped to within two feet and tapped in for a
birdie. Then, after making a 14-foot putt for birdie at No. 16,
Duval ended the day with a birdie at the longest hole on tour, the
par-5, 663-yard No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Duval showed his power on the final hole, reaching the downhill
green with a driver and a 3-wood, then two-putting from 50 feet. &QL;

FOR KNICKS, ONLY WARD WILL DO TO START AS POINT GUARD
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The New York Knicks will enter the season in
need of a compass. Amid the flurry and confusion of a
lockout-shortened schedule, the team will look to lean on simple
direction, solid guidance and a straight arrow.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Charlie Ward. Rather than chase a flashier name
who could be a misfit, the Knicks would feel more comfortable
starting their frantic season with Ward as their point guard.
</P>
<P>
   To re-sign Ward, a free agent, the Knicks will have to take what
Chris Childs made last year as the starter turned backup _ a
generous $3.12 million _ and raise that number until a smile cracks
Ward's steely facade. Although the competition for him is limited
because few teams have salary cap space, the Orlando Magic, the
Toronto Raptors and the Detroit Pistons have surfaced as
candidates. Acting as Ward's pitchman, Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy
expressed his concern over the possibility of losing Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried,'' Van Gundy said Friday at the Knicks' practice
facility at SUNY-Purchase. ``I think Charlie's abilities have been
vastly underrated by people outside our team. Within the NBA, he's
highly regarded. Here's a guy who each year has gotten better and
better and better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has continued to improve. He thinks pass first, which is
not a trait among a lot of point guards. And he has a presence on
the team in that people listen to him. He has respect from within.
We expect him to get better, and I want to make sure it's here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quicker you can get everything done and have a roster in
place, the better chance you have to get off to a good start. I
think that's as equal to how good your guys come back in shape.
It's important, if we can, to get him done. I don't think it's a
foregone conclusion, though, because I think there is a serious
interest from teams out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Money may not be the overriding issue, either. Ward has said he
wants to return to New York, but one teammate said that Ward was
irritated with the Knicks because of all the trade speculation he
was linked to last year. Ward asked himself, if they want me, why
are they trying to trade me? If there is a player who would choose
another team on principle, it would be Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were times when the Knicks were not so sold on
Ward, he came through on several critical occasions, like Game 5
against the Miami Heat in the Knicks' first-round playoff series.
That was the icing on a season of improvement. Despite his
defensive liabilities and unreliable decision-making, Ward made
enough progress to nudge Childs out of the starter's role last
season. Ward slipped into Childs' job and became a distributor
whose first priority was to deliver the ball to Patrick Ewing,
Allan Houston and Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Only when those options were shut down did Ward look for his
shot. Often, he delivered with an ever improving repertory last
season. Comparing his 1997-1998 production with his numbers for the
1996-1997 season, Ward was better in every major area: field-goal
percentage (39 to 45), free-throw percentage (76 to 81) and 3-point
shooting percentage (31.2 to 37.7).
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie is our starter,'' Van Gundy said. ``There's no doubt
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, there had been speculation that the Knicks would
try to land a bigger name at point guard. But a deal to acquire
Milwaukee's Terrell Brandon never materialized. The only other name
that has been bandied about lately is that of Israel's Oded Katash,
a European league star. He had a workout with the Knicks just
before the lockout and had sparked their interest. But as the labor
dispute dragged into January, Katash left to return to the Maccabi
team in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a chance he could come back,'' his agent, Marc
Fleisher, said. ``Whether he wants to or not, that's up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Katash's return may depend on how much pressure the Maccabi team
places on him to stay. Either way, Katash is certainly no threat to
Ward. At best, he is a reserve who could be signed by the Knicks
with one of the salary cap exceptions the team has.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a learning year for him, like for any rookie,''
Van Gundy said. ``If he is able to come over and we're able to sign
him, it's going to be hard for him. It's difficult to find playing
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Childs is traded, a move the Knicks have tried to make
for a year now, the backup minutes are going to be sewn up, too.
There is no question that if Ward returns, this will be his team.
With so much uncertainty about the coming season, the Knicks
believe they can rely on Ward to be their trusty guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if you lose a starter, especially through free
agency, it's hard,'' Van Gundy said. ``There are no point guards
you can replace Charlie with. I like Charlie and I believe in
Charlie.'' &QL;

PUSH TO REQUIRE SPRINKLERS RAISES COMPLEX ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fire safety breakthroughs are often born of terrible
losses of life that show the shortcomings of the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   But the surging emotions that survive such catastrophes, like
last month's fatal fire in a Manhattan high-rise, can also cloud an
issue as complex as New York City's push to require sprinklers in
all new homes.
</P>
<P>
   Few people on either side of the debate argue, however, with the
assertion that sprinklers are effective at stopping the spread of
fires. When activated in homes and apartments _ usually when the
temperature in a room reaches 160 degrees _ sprinkler heads
typically spray 15 to 25 gallons of water a minute on a fire, often
stopping it in its tracks, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The National Fire Prevention Association, a nonprofit group that
studies fire safety issues, said that no fire in a home, school or
institution with a working sprinkler system had ever killed more
than two people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or perhaps a more useful comment is that, if you have
sprinklers and you have a fire, you will reduce your chance of
dying by half to two-thirds, and your loss from fire by a half to
two-thirds,'' said John Hall, the association's assistant vice
president for fire analysis. ``These are huge reductions.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of extensive new sprinkler regulations also marshal
facts to support their contention that sprinklers, while effective,
are an expensive and unsightly answer to a problem that has already
been largely solved.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinklers, said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate
Board of New York, only duplicate protections already in place in
the newly constructed high-rise buildings where many New Yorkers
live. These buildings employ fire-resistant construction, intended
to contain a fire with extra-thick walls and doors designed to
withstand flames for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is the degree of additional protection weighed
against the problems that sprinklers can cause,'' Spinola said.
``Sprinklers don't put out fires. They just slow it down _
hopefully until the firefighter can get there. Fire-resistant
construction can do that just as effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Spinola pointed out that there were only 107 fire fatalities in
the city last year, the lowest number in 42 years. That death rate
is comparable, sprinkler opponents contend, to the rate in many
other cities where expansive sprinkler laws are in effect.
</P>
<P>
   But a Manhattan high-rise fire last month on West 60th Street,
in which four people died, illuminated the limitations of
fire-resistant construction. In one panic-filled moment, all that
building's precautions were undone when someone left a fire door
ajar and allowed the smoke to billow into hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the cost of installing sprinkler systems _ which
could add up to $360 to the yearly rent for a one-bedroom
apartment, the Real Estate Board says _ the real estate industry
argues that sprinklers are also subject to vandalism and a
potential lack of maintenance. The latter problem was cited in the
deaths of three firefighters last month in a Brooklyn high-rise
where a working sprinkler system that might have saved their lives
had been inexplicably turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Fire experts also acknowledge that sprinklers often do not work
well in fires where an explosion overwhelms the system. But they
discredit as myth the idea that sprinklers are always going off
accidentally and flooding homes and apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that sprinkler systems are carefully designed to
activate early in a real fire but not to activate in a nonfire
situation,'' a report by the National Fire Protection Association
concluded.

PARCELLS TAILORED DRESS FOR SUCCESS 
GLENN STILL NOT STARTING   
 LINE, LIKE JETS, HAS GROWN   
 JETS ARE HOMEBODIES  
</HEADLINE>
 (bl)  
By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Over the summer, the New York Jets put on new
uniforms with an old logo, the one they wore as the surprising
winners of Super Bowl III. Now, 30 years later, they are in the
playoffs and thinking it can happen.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, positive history is catching up to the Jets, who are
wearing the logo for the first time since the playoffs after the
1969 season, when the Jets lost to the Kansas City Chiefs as the
defending Super Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
   As coach Bill Parcells spent time this week analyzing Sunday's
playoff game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he reflected on the
uniform the Jets will wear at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Initiating a uniform change was Parcells' first decision when he
took over the team 23 months ago. Within 24 hours, he put into
motion the return to the logo _ the one Joe Namath wore on his
helmet, the one with the word ``Jets'' against a background that of
``NY.' Below it is a football. In addition, the Jets reverted to
white helmets with a green logo.
</P>
<P>
   When the old logo was changed _ to one that simply read
``Jets,'' with a bit of a swept-wing design and green helmets _
many of the players who were on the Super Bowl team complained.
They thought that history had been tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, linebacker Ralph Baker, who later became a Jets
assistant coach, recalled: ``Some of the older players were
alienated when the team changed the logo back in the '70s. Changing
the logo was a slap.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is a subtle difference between the 1960s design
and the new one. The green is darker now, and the laces of the
football under the word ``Jets'' are more distinct.
</P>
<P>
   As for Parcells, he actually wanted the change instituted in his
first season, 1997. But the National Football League's marketing
arm wanted to allow retailers to clear their shelves of the
merchandise on hand, so the change was put off until this season.
</P>
<P>
   Why Parcells did it is quite simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the people here what their feelings were,'' he said.
``Their unanimous feeling was it shouldn't have changed originally.
I'm a traditionalist. I have no trouble identifying when the
Yankees are playing. The Brooklyn Dodgers, the Bears, the Cubs, the
Giants. Those teams have had the same appearance and a team needs
that identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Corwin Brown, the 28-year-old free safety, was not born when
Namath played for the Jets. But he watches Namath on old football
game films on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I see the uniform, I think of Joe Namath beating
the Colts,'' Brown said. ``That was the history. We thought of the
uniform as something new, time to make some new things happen. I
think it helps, plus other teams look at you differently. Look at
how people regarded Tampa Bay last year when they changed
uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The public has been gobbling up the new uniforms, not only
excited by the traditional design, but also by the club's success.
The Minnesota Vikings, the Jets and the San Francisco 49ers are the
three hottest-selling teams right now, said Chris Widmaier,
director of corporate communications for the NFL, which sells about
$3 billion worth of items at retail.
</P>
<P>
   Three factors, he said, drive any team's success in marketing:
``Wins on the field, personalities _ and the Jets have Vinny
Testaverde, Aaron Glenn, Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet _ and
tradition. Those things combine in a cyclone force.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one factor that makes the Jets a bit different, though.
``Superstars on both sides of the ball move sales,'' said Widmaier.
``Who's the Jets' superstar? Parcells.''
</P>
<P>
   GLENN STILL NOT STARTING
</P>
<P>
   Except for Aaron Glenn, the Jets will start every first-stringer
who began the season. The Pro-Bowl cornerback will not start on
Sunday, Parcells said Friday, although he will dress after missing
three games with a sprained ankle. Ray Mickens continues in his
spot on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will not return kickoffs, either, with that job being
handled by Kevin Williams. But Glenn is likely to play cornerback
during Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill and I have a very good relationship,'' said Glenn. ``He
trusts me to tell him the truth about whether I can play or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has told injured players to let him know if they have
any doubts about their ability to perform. ``I don't want anyone to
have a built-in excuse,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   LINE, LIKE JETS, HAS GROWN
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have won 10 of their last 11 games as the offensive
line has improved. Staying healthy helped the unit, which has The
performed together for nearly all the team's 1,000 offensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed one play all year,'' said the rookie right tackle
Jason Fabini. ``My shoe came off and I couldn't tie it. I had to go
off for a play.''
</P>
<P>
   And why couldn't he tie his shoe?
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't maneuver the laces because of the cast I had on my
broken hand.''
</P>
<P>
   JETS ARE HOMEBODIES
</P>
<P>
   The Jets captured their last seven home games, while the
Jaguars, Sunday's playoff opponent, dropped three of their final
four on the road. January has been the best month in Parcells'
career: his teams have a .750 winning percentage.

IN TRIALS OF GUN MANUFACTURERS, A MOTHER GIVES A STATISTIC A NAME
AND FACE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Pa., Mass.)   By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn woman whose son was shot to death
personalized the human toll taken by illegally obtained handguns as
she testified Friday in a lawsuit that she helped bring against the
gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping there was some mistake, that he was still
alive,'' the woman, Freddie Hamilton, told a jury in U.S. District
Court in Brooklyn as she recalled her feelings while rushing to a
hospital on the night of July 27, 1993, after getting a phone call
about her son, Njuzi Ray, 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a shooting,'' she said, quoting the caller, a
friend of her son's. ``Njuzi didn't make it,'' she said the caller
added.
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, Ms. Hamilton said, she lost hope. ``When I
walked into the hospital, I knew he was dead,'' she said in a calm,
steady tone. ``I insisted on seeing him, but they said they had to
clean him up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the potentially precedent-setting suit, Ms. Hamilton, 55, is
one of seven plaintiffs: relatives of six homicide victims in New
York City and Yonkers, N.Y. in recent years, and a teen-ager who
survived a shooting but who still carries a bullet in his brain. In
a trial in the case that opened on Monday, they contend that the
more than 40 firearms manufacturers and distributors named as
defendants are collectively liable for the deaths and injuries,
regardless of which companies actually made and distributed the
weapons legally before they fell into unauthorized hands.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' lawyers argue that the companies have marketed
and distributed handguns so negligently that dealers in states with
weak gun-control laws are supplied with more new guns than can be
sold in the legitimate markets there.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the lawyers maintain, many of the excess weapons
move through an illegal gun-trafficking underground into states
with strong gun laws, like New York, and end up in the hands of
people like those who shot Njuzi Ray and the other victims in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The companies being sued include some of the most prominent
firearms makers in the nation, like Smith &AMP; Wesson and the Colt's
Manufacturing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the companies say that their clients cannot control
what happens to the weapons after they are sold legally to licensed
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers say that the companies adhere to tight
federal regulations. They deny that the companies oversupply
dealers in states with weak gun laws, particularly those in the
South. The lawyers say that many guns are shipped to those dealers
in the South because of a stronger demand there for guns for
legitimate uses like recreation and protection.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being widely followed by gun control advocates, the
firearms industry and lawyers for cities, like Chicago,
Philadelphia and Boston, that have sued or plan to sue the gun
manufacturers, much as states have sued the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the far-ranging issues in the Brooklyn suit are the
people on whose behalf it has been brought, like Ms. Hamilton and
the son she lost.
</P>
<P>
   Njuzi Ray, she recalled on the witness stand, had left high
school because of manic-depressive illness, but was striving to
build a life despite his problems. At the time of his death, she
said under questioning by a lawyer, Elisa Barnes, her son was
working in the family's vending machine business and, with a
friend, was producing background music that he hoped would be used
by rap artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had aspirations for himself, and I didn't see anything
limiting him,'' said Ms. Hamilton, the executive director of a
social services group in Brooklyn, the Child Development Support
Corp. After her son's slaying, she helped form a group called
Parents United to Rally for Gun Elimination, made up of women,
mostly from Brooklyn, who lobby for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   After stepping down from the witness stand, Ms. Hamilton said of
her son's killing and the killing of other victims with illegally
possessed handguns, ``Just say Njuzi was a personal tragedy of so
many other tragedies.''

SEAHAWKS FIND RIGHT MAN IN HOLMGREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND _ It won't be long before everyone around the Pacific
Northwest knows how much Mike Holmgren loves to ride his
Harley-Davidsons.
</P>
<P>
   Or that the 50-year-old father of four daughters makes daily
phone calls to the three who no longer live at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is nice. He is moral. He is intelligent,'' said Seahawk
defensive end Matt LaBounty, who played for the new Seahawk
executive vice president of football operations/general manager and
coach during Holmgren's seven fruitful seasons in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Nice. Moral. Intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   And now, most important: King.
</P>
<P>
   How else can you describe a two-time Super Bowl coach with ties
to the Super Bowl-winning 49ers who, within hours, convinced Paul
Allen and Co. to turn nearly complete control of the Seahawks to
him?
</P>
<P>
   That is why it's time to say: Move over, Lou Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has another big-name, big-time pro sports franchise
leader that is going to turn this town upside down. Like Piniella,
who used his blue blood Yankee pedigree, his Cincinnati Reds World
Series experience and a blustering, larger-than-life personality to
legitimize the Mariners, Holmgren is nothing short of instant
credibility for the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   That is without doubt the impression Holmgren gave at Seahawk
headquarters Friday, when he was announced as the franchise's sixth
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   The minute Holmgren walked into the room, decked out in a navy
blue double-breasted suit and razor-sharp sea-blue eyes, you could
tell Holmgren was a man of persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think there was a fumble a few plays before (the
49ers' NFC playoff game-winning touchdown),'' Holmgren quipped.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Holmgren was describing how, before last Sunday, he
had no thoughts of another job except taking the Packers to their
third straight Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But when the 49ers' last-minute victory ousted Green Bay,
solidifying Steve Mariucci's status in San Francisco, it was clear
that Holmgren's next-best professional bet was to head to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, after an accelerated but exhilarating 24-hour round of
negotiations, the deal was done.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect fit declared by all parties. That much you could tell
when Holmgren described his first moments with Allen as ``awesome''
_ what else could it have been?
</P>
<P>
   Later, Seahawk president Bob Whitsitt showed his complete
satisfaction with Holmgren's authoritative and charismatic
personality. The chemistry was palpable and, it sure seemed,
genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which team is going to have to pay the fine?'' Whitsitt joked
about Holmgren's ``dispute'' of the non-call by game officials on
Jerry Rice's apparent fumble during Green Bay's 30-27 playoff loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get the lawyers in on that,'' Holmgren shot back, a
twinkle in his eye and an intensity in his voice as he took command
of the packed room.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing personal against former Hawks coaches Dennis Erickson or
Tom Flores, but there hasn't been that sort of snap, crackle and
pop around here since Mount St. Helens blew its stack 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For more than $32 million over eight years, Holmgren has already
given pretty clear indication that he will be the name, the face,
the personality, and, with a formidable dose of stature about his
6-foot-5 frame, the overwhelming physical presence of the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Where Flores and Erickson could never capture the public
imagination, either on the field or off, Holmgren should prove
180-degrees different _ with endorsements and public service
announcements galore.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, 275 season tickets were sold within the first three
hours of Holmgren's installation as Seahawk Kahuna.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Eagle Hardware will no doubt come calling soon. Holmgren
might be the only guy who fits in Randy Johnson's old blue
bathrobe.
</P>
<P>
   And the way Holmgren projects consumer confidence, there could
be a new ``Mike Burger'' at Dick's _ a half-pound whopper, hold the
cheese. Holmgren ate enough of the stuff during his seven years in
America's dairyland.
</P>
<P>
   Winchell's could soon offer a Holmgren Crueller; Ivar's a West
Coast Offense Shrimp Basket; Red Hook a Holmgren Pale Ale.
Possibilities soar, just as realistic Super Bowl expectations rise.
</P>
<P>
   And we thought linebacker Chad Brown and running back Ricky
Watters were big deals in the Allen regime.
</P>
<P>
   Huh-uh. Next to the Pioneer Square stadium that will be built to
house the new-era Hawks, nothing compares to the largesse that is
Holmgren ... except, perhaps, the mysterious Mr. Allen, who
continues to spend and amaze.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, after flying the Holmgrens in on his private
jet, Allen ushered Holmgren and his family to Allen's Mercer Island
estate. There, Allen served up a seven-course French dinner _ none
of which Holmgren said he could distinguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept bringing out all these plates but I didn't know what
they were. The menu was all in French,'' Holmgren said, apparently
unaware that Allen _ a well-traveled gourmand _ might be offended.
</P>
<P>
   However, French menus might be one of the rare things that slip
from Holmgren's legendary attention to detail. The word on Holmgren
was pretty much the same from whatever corner it came.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he's a perfectionist. He demands excellence from everyone
around him and he doesn't have a lot of patience,'' Holmgren's
wife, Kathy, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's his work personality, but when he tries to
bring that home, we say: `We're not your secretaries. We don't work
for you. This is a democracy here.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, there is no such democracy on Holmgren's
football teams, although he does command the respect of his
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is fair. He is strict. He is very successful,'' LaBounty
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was there, there was no doubt he was in control. He
studied every inch of film. If he saw something he didn't like in
practice, he'd be hollering at the team. At first you'd think it
was nit-picking, but then you realize that's what it takes at this
level.''
</P>
<P>
   And Whitsitt said that within a matter of hours he came to view
Holmgren as an ``open, intelligent,'' questioning man upon whom
responsibility for the entire Seahawk organization can be safely,
enthusiastically placed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the stature and the presence and he is authoratitive,
but I don't mean in a dictatorial sense. He can build a
consensus,'' Whitsitt said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Holmgren is indeed a Bill Parcells-type of
football guru _ only Holmgren comes without the bullying need to
manipulate, a la Parcells. And he comes without the sing-along
Tostitos ads, although that could change.

UNANSWERED QUESTIONS IN FATAL POLICE SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERSIDE, Calif. _ The last hour of Tyisha Miller's young life
in this ``all-American city'' began with a flat tire and a
stranger's act of kindness in the early morning darkness three days
after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   It ended in a burst of police bullets, Ms. Miller's death and a
blizzard of unanswered questions, not only about what happened and
why, but also about race and justice. Protesters have marched,
police officers have been put on leave, much of the city is shaken
and so far the investigation has mainly led to more questions.
</P>
<P>
   One development this week was a new, detailed account of the
events leading to the shooting, provided by a lawyer for Ms.
Miller's family, based on the accounts of a friend who was with Ms.
Miller that night and of a cousin who witnessed the shooting from
about 40 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   The police have not been able to interview the friend, leading
to frustration and perhaps some skepticism. The account also does
not explain what is perhaps the most important factor leading to
the police shooting _ a gun in Ms. Miller's lap.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, shortly before 1 a.m., Ms. Miller, a 19-year-old
black woman, was driving her aunt's Nissan Sentra home with a
15-year-old friend, when a tire went flat, said the lawyer, Andrew
Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller had spent the day partying and shopping with several
girlfriends. They went to a mall, a Taco Bell and an amusement
park. Earlier in the day, said Susan Taylor, the mother of one of
the girls, they also did some drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Initial toxicology tests made public by the Riverside County
coroner put Ms. Miller's blood-alcohol level at 0.13 percent. The
legal limit for driving in California is 0.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyisha was at my house 45 minutes before she died,'' Mrs.
Taylor said, ``and the kids admitted that they had been doing some
drinking early in the day. But I didn't see any alcohol or smell
any alcohol on her breath. When she left here, she was not drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   When the tire went flat, neither Ms. Miller nor her passenger, a
girl whom Ms. Miller's family will identify only by her nickname,
Bug, was able to fix it, so they asked a white man coming out of a
store for help.
</P>
<P>
   Although the man was a stranger, Roth said, he rolled up his
sleeves and changed the tire. But the spare was almost flat. So,
driving his own car, the man led Ms. Miller and the girl, who
followed behind in the Nissan, to a gas station for air.
</P>
<P>
   At the station, the spare tire would not hold air and the man,
whom Roth refused to identify, was eager to go. Still, before
leaving, he agreed to drive Bug home to nearby Rubidoux, an
unincorporated area where both young women lived, across the Santa
Ana River from Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   The police have not been able to confirm this chain of events.
They also said they had not interviewed Bug or the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been unable to locate her,'' Sgt. Chris Manning of the
Riverside Police Department said, ``despite numerous attempts and
at least five public appeals for her to come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth said both witnesses were afraid but had agreed to talk to
the FBI, which has begun a preliminary investigation into the
death.
</P>
<P>
   When Bug and the man drove away, Ms. Miller stayed behind. She
was not about to leave her aunt's car at a gas station a few miles
from home. So she locked the doors and rolled up the windows. She
turned up the heat and the radio, and reclined in the driver's
seat. Apparently she also put a pistol in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   When Bug got home, she called Ms. Miller's family.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost 2 a.m., and Ms. Miller's young life was almost
over.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller's 18-year-old cousin, Anthonete Joiner, and a
girlfriend, Chy King, headed for the gas station after Bug's call.
</P>
<P>
   Before they left, Ms. Miller's aunt gave them her AAA card and
some advice: ``Be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ms. Joiner said she had planned to pull up to
Ms. Miller's car and simply hand her the card through the window.
But when she arrived, she saw that something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something was bubbling from her mouth,'' Ms. Joiner said. ``I
hurried out of my car and banged on the window. She wouldn't
respond. I banged on the door. She wouldn't respond. I banged on
the roof. She still wouldn't respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joiner's friend peered into the car. ``Anthonete,'' she
said, ``Tyisha has a gun!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joiner said she was on the edge of panic. Her cousin did not
own a gun. Sure, Tyisha was a tomboy, who played first base for
their church softball team, but she did not carry weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The police say that the gun did not belong to Ms. Miller and
that the owner is a woman they refused to identify. Manning did say
that the gun owner and Ms. Miller had no connection, and added that
how and why she had the gun is one of ``numerous unanswered
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joiner went back to her car and searched her purse for
change to call for help. ``Hurry up!'' Ms. Joiner shouted when
another cousin answered the phone. ``I can't get the door open!
Tyisha looks like something is wrong with her!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joiner and her friend then debated whether they should call
911. It seemed the best thing to do, the quickest way to get help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared out of my mind,'' Ms. Joiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend dialed 911, and Ms. Joiner said she heard her tell
the dispatcher that they could not wake Ms. Miller and that there
was a gun on her lap.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrived within minutes. Ms. Joiner said she ran over
to a police officer and told him that something was wrong with her
cousin, that she would not wake up and once again she mentioned the
gun.
</P>
<P>
   Get back, the officer said, and he and three other officers
began screaming at Ms. Miller to open the door and get out of the
car.
</P>
<P>
   One officer pounded on the glass with a flashlight, she said,
while the others took positions around the car, their guns out.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of minutes later,'' Ms. Joiner said, ``they were
shooting at her. She was just lying there the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joiner said the police rushed into the station's lot ``like
something was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller was struck at least 12 times, including four times in
the head and five times in the back. An autopsy showed the fatal
wounds were two shots to the head and one to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the police said the officers _ three of them white
and one Latino _ fired only after Ms. Miller had shot at them with
the .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   But hours later, the police said it was unclear whether Ms.
Miller had ever fired the gun, and could find no evidence that she
had.
</P>
<P>
   As more information came in, the police said later that Ms.
Miller had reached for the gun after one of the officers broke a
window to get into the car and give medical assistance.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``You get the notion that this is like a Greek tragedy,'' said
Ron Loveridge, the weary-sounding mayor of this city of 250,000
people, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles. Last year, Riverside _
a city of colleges, quiet streets and sunshine _ was named an
all-American city by the National Civic League.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers have been placed on paid leave as the
investigation continues. But that is not good enough for Ms.
Miller's family and the 300 black, white and Latino people who
marched through the city's streets a week after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want those police officers to be on paid vacation,''
said the Rev. Bernel Butler, Ms. Miller's cousin and a family
spokesman. ``We want them charged. We want them brought to trial.
Are they above the law?''
</P>
<P>
   The other day Ms. Joiner was in a grocery store, trying to
resume as normal a life as possible, when a stranger approached
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You killed her!'' the woman shouted at Ms. Joiner. ``You
called 911!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joiner broke down in tears and ran. Later, she even changed
her hair style, hoping she would no longer be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to help my cousin,'' Ms. Joiner said. ``I
was scared for her. That's why we called 911. She needed help.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Tyisha Miller will be buried, just outside this
all-American city.

STARS' UNBEATEN STREAK ENDS AT 15
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ The littlest goalie in hockey cut down the
biggest team in the NHL last night in what appeared to be a lost
episode of ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Brathwaite, the 5-foot-7 journeyman who played his first
game in two seasons only because the Calgary Flames were down to
their eighth goalie, stopped the Stars' franchise-best 15-game
unbeaten streak in a 1-0 Flames victory at the Canadian Airlines
Saddledome.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first NHL shutout for Brathwaite and pushed his NHL
career record to 6-17-4. Not only did the Stars lose for the first
time since Dec. 4, 1998 _ ending the league's longest unbeaten
streak this season _ the Flames stopped an eight-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars came in with the best road record in the NHL (11-4-4).
The Flames had the second-worst home record (now 6-12-2). The Stars
had the top power play, the Flames the worst penalty kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, yeah, it did seem like a mismatch,'' Stars captain
Derian Hatcher said. `'I guess what's most disappointing is they
outworked us. They deserved this win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hatcher added the Stars didn't take Calgary lightly, and
that sentiment was echoed by winger Pat Verbeek.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' Verbeek said. ``Look at their lineup, they
have a hard-working team.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Flames did indeed work hard defensively, that's
not what killed the Stars. Both teams settled into a boring,
defensive game and each team waited for the other to make the first
move. That cautious style hurt the Stars as they didn't get in hard
on the forecheck, didn't force the Flames into mistakes and didn't
get many second shots on Brathwaite.
</P>
<P>
   And that caution blew up in the Stars' collective face at the
9:11 mark of the second period when the Flames finally broke
through. Jeff Shantz popped in the only goal of the night on a
simple backhand that somehow bounced off Ed Belfour's stick, over
his head and then eluded the grasp of defenseman Shawn Chambers as
it slowly tumbled over the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had missed on just such a scoring opportunity earlier
in the game when winger Grant Marshall drove hard to the net and
collided with Brathwaite. The puck squirted out of the pile, but
Brathwaite gloved it before it could go over the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   That was as close as the Stars would come. Brathwaite shut down
a strong scoring chance from Joe Nieuwendyk in the third period,
but even that shot wasn't truly dangerous as Brathwaite simply
covered it with his pads.
</P>
<P>
   That Brathwaite was even in the game was a miracle of sorts.
Injuries forced the Flames to go through seven previous goalies,
including one call-up from junior hockey and a call-up from the
East Coast Hockey League who had to borrow pads from the Flames. It
had become almost a laughing matter in Calgary, where the Flames
are 13-24-3.
</P>
<P>
   But Brathwaite turned the joke on the Stars, who fell to 25-6-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to keep \Rthe streak\S going, but that's not the big
deal,'' Verbeek said. ``We were more looking at getting a good
start to the \Rfive-game\S road trip. That's more disappointing
than anything.''  &LR; tagtop: Mike Heika, (817) 390-7760

WORLD WAR I VET, 100, RECEIVES FRANCE'S TOP DECORATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eighty years after William Zelnicker fought in
World War I, the French government remembered his service with its
highest honor Friday _ but the 100-year-old said he'd rather forget
war and recall the life he made in the years after.
</P>
<P>
   ``I raised a family. After my wife died, I did my own cooking,
dish-washing. I never complained to the U.S. government. I've lived
a good life,'' the former doughboy said during a ceremony at the
Veterans Affairs Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center and Nursing Home.
There the French deputy consul general bestowed upon Zelnicker the
National Order of the Legion of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't forget what you did 80 years ago,'' said Deputy
Consul General Philippe Vinogradoff. ``You helped us reach victory.
You helped us make a peaceful Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaned over and pinned on Zelnicker the crimson ribbon and
white cross first awarded by Napoleon, then kissed the aging
veteran on both cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   The French began a program of awarding their highest honor to
all surviving soldiers and nurses from Allied countries, in
recognition of the 80th anniversary of the war's end Nov. 11, 1918.
VA officials believe about 1,500 are still alive in the United
States, but only 80 have received their honors so far.
</P>
<P>
   Zelnicker ran away from home and enlisted in the Army's 26th
``Yankee'' Division at age 17, even before the United States had
entered World War I. He served as an ambulance driver and stretcher
bearer in the trenches that etched the French countryside, until
Sept. 24, 1918. Then, during an American offensive in St. Mihiel,
the Germans launched a mustard-gas attack that scarred his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The noxious cloud that swept across the battle lines ``was just
as thick as mud,'' Zelnicker recalled. ``After it took effect on
me, it affects your lungs; my breathing is heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent two years recovering in an Army hospital, and even 80
years later, he said, doctors believe the aftereffects are causing
him circulation problems.
</P>
<P>
   But sitting in his Van Nuys home, where he lived on his own
until moving to the VA hospital seven months ago, Zelnicker
preferred to recall a time after the war, when he could dance the
Charleston with his young bride, Anna, at a dance hall in his
hometown of Providence, R.I. She died 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The pair raised a daughter, Sylvia, and two sons _ Albert, who
fought in the Navy in World War II and Korea, and Harold, killed in
action at 18 with the Army in Korea. A trace of bitterness colors
Zelnicker's voice when he talks about the death, and about how he
quit his membership in veterans organizations afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Zelnicker shrugged when asked the secret of his long life, but
his family believes it was the fruits, vegetables and other healthy
foods he prepared for himself while living on his own up to age 99.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the string of jobs he held after the war _ washing
dishes; running a five-and-dime in Bristol, R.I.; selling balloons
during parades for 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done everything _ everything you can do to make a
dollar,'' he said. ``I was very happy.''

QUAYLE LIKELY TO SET UP EXPLORATORY 2000 PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle likely will form a presidential
exploratory committee next month, putting him in competition with
another Arizonan, Sen. John McCain, in the first test of the GOP
primary:
</P>
<P>
   A candidate's ability to raise up to $20 million this year is
crucial to be considered a serious contender in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle signaled his intentions to enter the race Thursday night,
when he told reporters after a speech in Tempe that he probably
will seek a ticket to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable sources said Friday that Quayle likely will first
file papers in February with the Federal Election Commission that
would create a presidential exploratory campaign committee. Such a
move would allow Quayle to begin raising funds and to travel to key
early primary states as a potential presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to make a formal announcement in April.
</P>
<P>
   McCain became the first Republican candidate to form a
presidential exploratory committee on Dec. 30. Since then, the
field has begun to fill out, with Elizabeth Dole strongly hinting
that she might run and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander
forming an exploratory committee on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Steve Forbes, who won Arizona's 1996 GOP presidential
primary, also is expected to form such a committee next month.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually early start of the next presidential contest puts
additional pressure on candidates to secure the limited number of
Republican contributors who can give the maximum of $1,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, a prodigious fund-raiser, is prepared to raise $20
million to $25 million, according to his spokesman, Cameron Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not daunted by that task,'' Carter said. ``Vice
President Quayle has a national fund-raising base and he has
hundreds of thousands of supporters, active donors, around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were to run for president, there are no concerns he
would raise the requisite amount of money to be competitive and
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said last week that he will try to raise $14 million to
$15 million this year, should he decide to run. He has $2 million
from his 1998 Senate re-election campaign that he can use.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is expected to further his presidential effort next week
by hiring a campaign manager and by increasing his fund-raising
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle last year toured the nation campaigning for GOP
candidates through his Phoenix-based political action committee,
Campaign America. Federal rules, though, prohibit Quayle from
transfering the $200,000 to $300,000 in remaining PAC funds to a
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said a ``fire wall'' exists between Campaign America and
Quayle's presidential activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no commingling of activities or monies, no
cross-pollination whatsoever'' with Quayle's presidential effort,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said Quayle has a
fund-raising advantage over such lesser-known candidates as McCain
and House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any former vice president of the United States ought to be a
formidable fund-raiser, just in terms of connections made over the
years,'' Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that ``there is great skepticism about Quayle as
someone who could really win the nomination . . . I think it
undercuts his fund-raising ability.''
</P>
<P>
   State GOP Chairman Mike Hellon said McCain has the upper hand in
Arizona, but the state hardly could be considered a gold mine of
presidential funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush will raise as much money in Arizona as Dan
Quayle,'' Hellon said, referring to the Texas governor and likely
GOP presidential front-runner. ``Bush has personal ties and
political ties here.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle has lived in Paradise Valley since 1996, but is expected
to make his formal announcement in Huntington, the Indiana town he
represented in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg said the expanding GOP field will make it even harder
to compete for funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more candidates you have, the more likely you're going to
freeze contributions for everyone, or the people who are less
well-known will stay less well-known,'' Rothenberg said. &QL;

SHIFTING GEARS: HOLMGREN MADE GRADE AS TEACHER AND COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tall and blessed with a strong arm, Mike Holmgren was a prize
quarterback recruit from San Francisco, a new-age player for the
option-minded '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Cal called him the next Craig Morton, a replica of the Bears'
All-American, only bigger. Stanford would sign Jim Plunkett, but
wanted Lincoln High's oversized prospect as much, if not more.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 Holmgren chose USC and rarely got off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   He threw just 27 passes as a collegian, completing eight. He had
one attempt against Washington. Typical of his career, the ball was
intercepted and returned 23 yards. By a Husky defensive lineman, no
less.
</P>
<P>
   The man perceived to be an NFL genius, to have unfailing vision
regarding all matters pigskin, has not always made the soundest
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to discourage him from going to USC because they
weren't using an offense to feature his talents,'' said Vic Rowen,
a family friend and former San Francisco State University football
coach. ``But that's what happens with 17-year-olds; they get
dazzled by the big-time program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Jim Plunkett and Mike reversed schools, Mike would have
gone on and played for years in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren the coach would take a long and circuitous route to the
pros. Twelve years on the high school level. Twenty-two consecutive
defeats with one team. It was a time for making ends meet, not
making things happen.
</P>
<P>
   He was the head coach at San Jose's Oak Grove High in 1980, the
third entry on his resume, when Rowen offered him a job as San
Francisco State offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. The
position paid $23,000, less than Holmgren was making at the time.
He initially balked at taking a paycut. He gave in to Rowen. Good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hadn't taken the job, Mike might still be coaching at
Oak Grove right now,'' the 79-year-old Rowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren instead is the newly hired Seahawks coach and general
manager, hailed as a guy with all the answers after guiding Green
Bay to a pair of Super Bowls and, as an assistant, helping San
Francisco to two others. He was part of BYU's national championship
run in 1984, his last stop before drawing an NFL paycheck. The
persuasive Rowen got him that job, too.
</P>
<P>
   On the outside, Holmgren, 50, is a frumpy guy with a mustache
and a motorcycle. Inside, he's a veritable web site of football
knowledge, acquired from several mentors. Rowen, SFSU's leader for
37 years until 1989, taught him independence. USC's legendary John
McKay gave him toughness. BYU's LaVell Edwards passed along the
intricacies of the passing game. And Bill Walsh, the former 49ers
head man, showed him what it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's travails at USC helped establish him as a coach, too.
He went from a 3,592-yard passer as a high school senior to
perennial bench-warmer. He never played enough to letter. He sat
and watched as smaller, quicker quarterbacks Steve Sogge, Toby Page
and Jimmy Jones ran the Trojans. Holmgren handled adversity by
paying attention. First to practice, first to meetings, last to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says Brett Favre has a gun on him, but in his heyday
Mike could whistle it, too,'' said Craig Fertig, the Trojans'
quarterback coach at the time. ``He was like the hard-luck guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fertig used to pull out an electric football game then popular
with youngsters, set up the figurines and demonstrate what was
desired on offense to kneeling USC players. Even in his idle state,
Holmgren always had a question.
</P>
<P>
   In the Trojan empire, this was almost blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when John McKay said something, it was gospel, but
Mike was the first person who asked why,'' said Fertig, now a
Fox-TV college football analyst. ``He was the first person I
coached who ever did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren thought he was good enough to force the Trojans to
change their Tailback U. offense. He didn't anticipate them
bringing in O.J. Simpson during his sophomore year to keep the
vaunted Student Body Right and Student Body Left approach firmly
intact. Nor did Holmgren count on a dislocated thumb, sprained
ankle and senior season-ending shoulder injury thwarting his every
move to become USC's chief hand-off guy.
</P>
<P>
   He tried playing in the pros. He was an eighth-round draft pick
of the St. Louis Cardinals and went to camp with the New York Jets.
But he had sat too long.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren, a likeable guy who did killer impersonations of his
coaches and others and was always good for a sit-down beer, turned
to Fertig for his first job. The coach got him hired as a bartender
at the Nightwatch, a onetime USC coaches' hangout in Pasadena. Not
exactly a direct route to an NFL headset. Or was it?
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have less than glamorous playing careers, to some
degree, have less ego and better adapt to a bigger workload,'' said
Randy Cross, former 49ers center. ``I think what he really excelled
at in Green Bay was his handling of people and handling of
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren effectively sees the whole picture, but has built a
reputation as an unparalleled quarterback coach. He has had a
direct hand in the maturation of Joe Montana, Steve Young, Brett
Favre, Mark Brunell, Steve Bono and Ty Detmer in the pros, and
polished Young and Robbie Bosco during his BYU stint. Seahawk
starter Jon Kitna will get the next makeover.
</P>
<P>
   The former Trojan sub uses what Walsh gave him as a quarterback
blueprint: Be specific when teaching your men behind center, never
general. Too much information, and no one will remember it during
the heat of battle. Walsh stresses the word ``decisive'' in his
teachings. He wants his quarterbacks to have instant recall and
reflexive action for any situation they encounter. Holmgren imparts
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's organized, an excellent teacher, a communicator,'' said
Sam Wyche, former Cincinnati and Tampa Bay coach, and another Walsh
disciple. ``Which is coaching, not cheerleading, when your guy
makes a nice throw. It's teaching him how to make the right throw
every time. Mike does a good job of that. I don't think this guy
will ever be hurting for a job.''
</P>
<P>
   With quarterbacks, Holmgren is best described as a sculptor. He
thinks he can mold just about anyone into a productive quarterback.
Take Seahawk reject Rick Mirer, for instance. Holmgren brought the
shaken one to Green Bay this past season as a pet project. Mirer
was a lost cause to all but the Packer coach. Mirer was the car up
on the blocks, getting overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really excited about what he saw in Rick Mirer _ he
thought he had to completely reteach the guy the position, and he
was excited about doing it,'' Cross said. ``He had Steve Young and
Joe Montana at the same time, and that wasn't exactly a lovefest.
He had to be father, confessor, and disciplinarian and friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody in my opinion in the league better at
developing a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren wants to make everybody feel good. A happy player is a
productive player. When African-Americans on his team started
complaining about getting a decent haircut in predominantly white
Green Bay, their coach procured the services of a Milwaukee barber.
And when Packers voiced their dislike for the standard
training-table culinary offering, the coach had soul food catered
from Milwaukee twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to reward his players. At the same time, Holmgren
expects them to earn the extras, the frills. There's a certain
toughness beneath the fun-loving veneer. John McKay gave it to him.
That, and a mere 27 passes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Holmgren seems determined to never let another
quarterback die on the vine. Each player is him, waiting his turn,
hoping his chance will come. For Holmgren, he rode the Trojan
hearse, not horse, and made the best of it.

KITNA, SEAHAWKS VETERANS `JACKED' ABOUT HOLMGREN HIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND _ For the past two seasons, Seahawks wide receiver Mike
Pritchard has been comparing blossoming quarterback Jon Kitna to a
young Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Kitna was face to face with the coach credited with
molding a young Favre into a three-time NFL MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna came by the team's headquarters after hearing that former
Green Bay Packers coach Mike Holmgren had been hired to be the
executive vice president of football operations/general manager and
head coach of the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' Kitna said after exchanging handshakes and a
few words with Holmgren. ``They seem to use a lot of play-action.
They don't run a play without a complement. It reminds me a little
of what we did in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Brett Favre takes that to another level because of
the plays he can make. But hopefully I can go out and do the same
things.''
</P>
<P>
   With Holmgren come hopes and high expectations, not to mention
the West Coast offense that has helped make Favre a star and plays
into Kitna's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   If this Kitna-Favre comparison seems like too big a stretch,
Favre did play his college ball at Southern Mississippi and was
with the Atlanta Falcons for one season before being traded to the
Packers. Granted, Southern Miss is like Notre Dame when compared to
Central Washington, where Kitna played. But Kitna appears to have
the skills to shove Holmgren's offense into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when Mike is probably at his best _ getting young
quarterbacks ready to be stars,'' said Seahawks running back Ricky
Watters, who played for Holmgren in 1991 when both were with the
49ers _ Watters as an injured rookie, Holmgren as the offensive
coordinator. ``Jon already has a lot of confidence. He already has
a lot of poise. He already has a field presence about him. But
anything that's missing, Mike will fill in all those gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   How?
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mike is not afraid to do, and what he does well, is he
gets on you and then he praises you,'' Watters said. ``Then he gets
on you and he praises you again. And that's what you need. It's
like having a parent. You want a little fear there, a little
respect there and a lot of love.''
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Robinson also sees this Kitna-Holmgren match having a
spark. Robinson was a Pro Bowl free safety with the Seahawks who
was traded to Green Bay in 1996 and became a Pro Bowl player. This
year, he is with Atlanta and again was voted to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most obvious thing is he really knows the game, especially
his execution of the West Coast offense _ the quick strike, the
distant reads, the most probable open receiver. And he's always had
the quarterbacks, receivers and backs to get it done,'' Robinson
said Thursday from his home near Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Seahawks have a quarterback in Jon Kitna that reminds me
of a young Mark Brunell. If (Holmgren) goes to Seattle, you'll see
the offense change dramatically to the quick strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren is here, and Kitna is, as he put it, ``ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna was not alone in his enthusiasm over Holmgren's hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does the same thing that coach (Bill) Parcells brings when
he goes to the Jets,'' Watters said. ``It's like instant respect in
knowing that this guy knows what it takes to win. He's going to do
what it takes to win. You don't have to guess or question anything
that he's doing because you know whatever he's doing is for that
reason _ to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very jacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Matt LaBounty was traded by the Packers to the
Seahawks for Robinson, but is looking forward to the reunion with
Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited because obviously he's an excellent coach,''
LaBounty said. ``It appears that the people upstairs, the powers to
be, went out and got the best coach available. ... A lot of the
guys are excited and already looking forward to next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's background is offense, and he called the plays in
Green Bay. But the Packers also had strong defenses because
Holmgren hired strong coordinators _ first Ray Rhodes, then Fritz
Shurmur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Mike Holmgren's record, you can't help but get
excited,'' cornerback Willie Williams said. ``Once I heard they
were trying to get him, I was hoping this would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great defense and I'm sure Mike Holmgren will find
the right guy to bring out the best in us.''

GRANNY GETS LIFT ON LONG JOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDS, resending for those needing) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe it's her age. Could be the sign around her
chest. Whatever draws attention is fine for ``Granny D'' Doris
Haddock on her trek for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive great-grandmother wearing a backpack, light pants
and long-sleeved shirts, and hiking boots is still on the road to
the nation's capital after leaving Pasadena on New Year's Day in
the wake of the Tournament of Roses parade.
</P>
<P>
   She's been urged on by motorists, given lodging by strangers and
accompanied every step of the way by the West Virginia secretary of
state.
</P>
<P>
   Haddock reached the low desert community of Cabazon on Friday
after a stop on the Morongo Indian Reservation outside of Banning.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading out from Banning, the New Hampshire activist said
she was drawing strength from fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped for it because I'm talking of creating a groundswell,
but I certainly didn't really expect it,'' said the 88-year-old
retired shoe company secretary from Dublin, N.H. ``As a matter of
fact, it gives you energy, there's no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such energy won't house or feed the pilgrim for political
change. So she has been thankful for the legions of people who
learned of her trek and provided room and board.
</P>
<P>
   A good measure was generated by a letter mailed nationally by
the nonpartisan political reform group Common Cause urging members
to aid the crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pioneers came from the east to the west to find a better
way of life, and she's going from west to east to create a better
environment for the average citizen to run for public office,''
said Ralph Langley, a Common Cause member in Upland who housed
Haddock, organized a week's worth of lodging and provided rides at
the end of several legs of her walk.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old retiree said the effort was both exhilarating
and exhausting. ``What makes it worthwhile is the satisfaction to
participate in what I think is a historic event.''
</P>
<P>
   Lending daily support has been Ken Hechler, the West Virginia
secretary of state, who has walked with Haddock from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a lot of crazy things,'' said the 84-year-old nine-time
congressman and former speech writer for President Truman. ``I just
was excited about stirring up public support. It already has. It's
pretty obvious when three out of four cars going down the highway
honk and lots of them stop and say I want to sign your petition.''
</P>
<P>
   Many others along the route apparently share that sense of
history in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Upland presented her the key to the city, San Bernardino gave
her an official lapel pin, and the Yucca Valley Chamber of Commerce
plans a parade Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Walking some 10 miles a day and making numerous impromptu
speaking engagements, however, sapped enough strength to force
Haddock off the road for rest this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an urge to press ahead. I didn't want to lose the
momentum, but my legs were starting to get a little heavy,'' she
said. ``Family and friends convinced me to take a little rest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Haddock figures this initial fatigue will pass. ``It's so
exciting. I'm very sure I'm going to make it.''

   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia _ The commander of the largest
rebel force in Colombia sought out government officials and foreign
dignitaries here Friday, saying that he was committed to seeing
talks progress to end the civil war. He said he was absent from a
ceremony on Thursday to start the effort because of death threats.
</P>
<P>
   The commander, Manuel Marulanda, who has been living in the
mountains since 1949, appeared unexpectedly Friday morning outside
town, Deputy Labor Minister Fabio Palacio said.
</P>
<P>
   Palacio said he and the chief of the security detail for
President Andres Pastrana were on their way at 6 a.m. to obtain
security equipment when Marulanda showed up to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   The commander, Palacio recounted, said that his group had
information that sharpshooters would make an attempt on his life
and that he mixed in the crowd that watched the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Palacio quoted Marulanda as describing the peace talks as ``a
long road, but a positive one for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He also said,'' Palacio recalled, ``the most important thing
that happened yesterday was the initiation of a process of peace
and that that was more important than his appearance and that there
would be other opportunities for him to meet the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure to attend what Pastrana called ``an appointment with
history'' had initially appeared as a humiliation of the new
president, who is staking his career on forging peace with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana met Marulanda before taking office in August and
pledged to remove security forces from an area twice the size of El
Salvador to allow a dialogue with the rebels. The festivities on
Thursday were supposed to begin talks to build a peace with the
rebels, who have been battling government forces for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla's actions away from the limelight appeared geared
toward reversing any ill will created by Marulanda's absence.
Palacio said that Marulanda had met negotiators designated by the
government for talks scheduled to begin Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The commander also hastened to meet invited foreign delegates on
Thursday night and Friday morning. A Nicaraguan legislator, Jacinto
Suarez, said Marulanda had spoken to delegations from Costa Rica,
Italy, Mexico, Nicaragua and other countries, stressing his desire
for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first question everybody asked was why he didn't come, and
he said that they had intelligence that there would be an attempt
on his life,'' Suarez said. ``He said they're engaged in this
process and they're not asking for the participation of anybody
else for the moment. That this is a process that Colombians have to
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is trying to end the carnage that has claimed 35,000
lives in 10 years. The fighting has been between the government,
paramilitary forces that defend landowners, who frequently enjoy
complicity of the army, and leftist guerrillas. The war, fought
largely through attacks on civilian populations, has displaced more
than 1.2 million farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups attribute 70 percent of the political
killings in Colombia to the paramilitary groups, but all sides have
been implicated.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rebels have made bold incursions into areas widely
considered to be a stronghold of right-wing paramilitary forces,
including one in Nudo de Paramillo that led to false reports that
the rebels had killed the top paramilitary leader, Carlos Castano.
</P>
<P>
   Castano contacted a radio station in Medellin this week to
promise revenge. That may have been one reason for the rebels to
take the death threats especially seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a unilateral cease-fire that the paramilitary chief
had declared to demonstrate his will for peace expired, oddly, on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Palacio said the top rebel had been in a house 10 minutes from
the town square on Thursday. Palacio told a few reporters that two
sharpshooters were arrested minutes before he was to appear
alongside Pastrana.

PERFECT MATCH: SEAHAWKS SATISFY HOLMGREN'S THIRST FOR POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND _ It was almost 16 months ago that Green Bay coach Mike
Holmgren offered what he thought was an innocent answer to a
question about his future: Would he like to run an entire football
operation in the NFL?
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren said yes, and has been dogged by the response ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first question he was asked each day during news
conferences at the Super Bowl last January, when the speculation
was that Holmgren was headed to the Seahawks. It was a question he
couldn't dodge this season, and even ignited a regrettable incident
with a fan in Green Bay who suggested Holmgren was more concerned
with his next job than his current one.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Holmgren got that job when he was named executive vice
president of football operations/general manager and head coach of
the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks signed him to an eight-year contract _ not for the
$5 million a year that was widely reported, but for closer to $4
million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never a slam dunk,'' Holmgren said. ``I wasn't going
to leave to leave. That was never going to happen. But if the right
situation, in our opinion, came forth then I wanted to try it. And
this is exactly the right situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Holmgren has his dream job, what will he do with it?
</P>
<P>
   He'll start by assembling a coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is my No. 1 priority, get my coaches hired, get them in
here and let's get to work,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren did not contact any of his Packers assistant coaches
Friday, but the most likely to follow him to Seattle are defensive
coordinator Fritz Shurmur, defensive line coach Larry Brooks, wide
receivers coach Nolan Cromwell, linebackers coach Jim Lind,
offensive line coach Tom Lovat, quarterbacks coach Andy Reid, tight
ends coach Mike Sherman and defensive backs coach Bob Valesente.
Reid and offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis have interviewed for
head-coaching positions in Chicago and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren will interview the six Seahawks assistants who are
under contract for at least one more season. Those with the best
chances to be retained are special teams coach Pete Rodriguez and
linebackers coach Jim Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't complete the entire staff,'' Holmgren said of mixing
and matching former Packers and Seahawks assistants. ``I'm fairly
certain there are some other guys I'll have to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren wants to have his staff in place within a week, so he
will have to work quickly. He is scheduled to fly back to Green Bay
today and return to the team's headquarters early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Those assistants will then help in evaluating the roster and
deciding which players must be added in free agency and the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren will have his hands in every aspect of the football
operation and perhaps beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language of his contract is that he has everything,'' said
Bob LaMonte, Holmgren's agent.
</P>
<P>
   Everything? Marketing? Tickets?
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, he will oversee those things,'' LaMonte said.
``They have a quality organization and business people. Mike will
come in and assess that. One thing about Mike Holmgren, there will
be a singular purpose. There will not ever be a question about the
direction of this football team. That will be one way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holmgren way.
</P>
<P>
   It was a thirst for power that made Holmgren want to leave Green
Bay after coaching the Packers to an 84-42 record in seven seasons
and a victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI.
With the strong hand of general manager Ron Wolf controlling things
in Green Bay, the Packers were unable to give Holmgren the power he
sought.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks decided Holmgren was their man quickly, and did
everything possible to make sure he felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we feel a fit, we move,'' Seahawks president Bob Whitsitt
said. ``We felt a fit, and we moved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Holmgren did not come cheaply. In addition to his salary,
which makes Holmgren the highest-paid coach in the NFL, the
Seahawks must give the Packers their second-round pick in April's
draft as compensation for signing Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren had one year remaining on his contract in Green Bay,
but was given a clause last February that allowed him a 21-day
window to accept a job as general manager and coach with another
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles also had contacted
Holmgren, but he canceled weekend trips after deciding the Seahawks
were offering what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became abundantly clear that they were not going to let
Mike go to Baltimore, no matter what,'' LaMonte said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day for smiles all around at the team's headquarters,
and even a little giddiness.
</P>
<P>
   When Holmgren complained about officiating in the Packers' loss
to the 49ers on Sunday, Whitsitt interrupted him and offered,
``Would that fine be a Packer fine or will it be a Seahawk fine?''
</P>
<P>
   Cracked Holmgren, ``I don't know. We've got to get the lawyers
involved in that one.''

RED-CARPET TREATMENT WOWS HOLMGREN FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND _ Without his wife's approval, Mike Holmgren would not
have been signing a $32 million-plus contract with the Seahawks
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the most input,'' Kathy Holmgren said. ``If I won't go,
he won't go. We work as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Football factors and control issues are important to Mike
Holmgren, but family is the foremost consideration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when he was the 49ers' offensive coordinator, Holmgren
turned down head-coaching jobs with the Cardinals and Jets, fearing
disruption at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a great thing for me,'' Holmgren said at
the time. ``It wouldn't have been the greatest thing for my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Super Bowl two years ago, he dropped his
weekly TV and radio shows and most of his speaking engagements to
free up time in his schedule to spend with his wife and kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there are things you have to do, but if there's a
choice, I'm going to choose being with my family,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   The Holmgrens have four daughters, three of whom are officially
grown-ups, and another who is about to be. In 1990, the twins were
juniors nearing the end of high school. Now Calla and Jenny are 25.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing her mom's history, 21-year-old Emily got married young
and is currently on a mission in Bolivia. Thirty years ago,
21-year-old Kathy Holmgren was in the Congo, beating the bush, a
nurse giving physicals and injections to the natives.
</P>
<P>
   The Holmgrens are one removed from an empty nest. Gretchen, 17,
is in her senior year at Ashwaubenon (Wis.) High School. She went
to Seattle Pacific University on Thursday to check out the campus,
marking it down as a potential candidate now that dad has
relocated.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen accompanied her parents to Seattle on Paul Allen's
private jet. Gretchen had a wow-like expression on her face when
asked about the flight in luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her: ``Don't get used to it,''' Kathy Holmgren said.
``Enjoy the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holmgrens enjoyed their Thursday night dinner at Allen's
estate, eating French fare they could not pronounce. Kathy Holmgren
said she felt honored that Allen would cut short his scuba diving
trip in Costa Rica to be the dinner host. She sat next to Allen's
mom and found her to be a ``delightful woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The description applies to Kathy Holmgren. As reporters hovered
around her, she politely answered questions. But you got the
feeling she would prefer anonymity. This is not as big of a deal to
her as it is to everyone else. She remembers when Mike Holmgren
used to be a teacher at a Catholic high school, Sacred Heart, in
San Francisco and was paid $600 a month, not $4-plus million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   She has been known to use her maiden name when working for
charity, wanting people to recognize her only as Kathy, not wife of
the Green Bay Packers coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be nice to not be in a fishbowl,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren finds perspective at Paul's Pantry, a charity that
distributes food to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love going to the Pantry,'' she told the Milwaukee
Journal Sentinel. ``I love all the people. They're so genuine. It
keeps you grounded in what's important in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren is working toward her second master's degree, in social
work, at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. She received her
first in oncology nursing when Mike was coaching quarterbacks like
Steve Young at BYU in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real important for each one of us to have our own life so
that I don't depend on him for my happiness,'' she said. ``I have
to be happy on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holmgrens met when they were both 13 at a church camp in
Santa Cruz, Calif. Two years later, before he was old enough to
drive, Mike Holmgren proposed marriage in a card to Kathy. They
would be married after college.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, in the game plan drawn up by his wife, Mike Holmgren
will be running a bookstore instead of an NFL franchise. Kathy
Holmgren will be upstairs doing social work.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Kathy Holmgren talked about how nice it was to leave the
wind chill behind, fully knowing, however, what to expect here _
rain and inevitable heat if her husband fails to produce.
</P>
<P>
   The Holmgrens are looking forward to sampling Seattle's
restaurants. Undoubtedly, they will find a new home somewhere in
Kirkland near the Seahawks headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A priority is the smallest commute possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At work, Mike Holmgren will be the man in charge. At home, he
still has a general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a perfectionist. He demands excellence from the people
around him,'' Kathy Holmgren said. ``But when he tries to bring
that stuff home, we go: `Whoa, we're not your secretaries. This is
a democracy here.'''

FANS SHOULD APPRECIATE NBA DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You're a Denver Nuggets fan. What if your team had
been able to keep Antonio McDyess?
</P>
<P>
   You're a Minnesota Timberwolves fan. What if the Wolves hadn't
emptied the piggy bank for Kevin Garnett and had a few million left
to keep both Stephon Marbury and Tom Gugliotta?
</P>
<P>
   You're a Clippers fan. OK, that's a stretch, but maybe you would
be if they hadn't shipped out every talented player who ever asked
for a 50-cent raise.
</P>
<P>
   What if NBA teams could compete on equal ground, thriving only
on their basketball acumen and not by the financial portfolio of
the owner?
</P>
<P>
   What if the real winner in the NBA's nasty little labor war was
not the billionaires or the millionaires, but Joe Wage Earner?
</P>
<P>
   That might just be the case.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's new labor deal includes maximum salaries for every
class of player and several wrinkles that should greatly inhibit
free agency, reduce players' bargaining leverage and generally
promote an even playing field for all 29 teams.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Major League Baseball, where stratification of
the classes has up to 18 teams already eliminated from the
postseason _ before spring training begins _ the NBA's future looks
bright indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a deal where truly everyone wins,'' said
Lakers executive Jerry West, ``and I'm talking about the sports
fans from all the different cities that comprise the NBA, from the
small-market teams to the big market teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   Maximum salaries: The much-discussed Larry Bird exception
allowed teams to pay any amount to keep their free agents. Problem
was, if a player demanded too much of his cash-strapped team, the
Bird rule failed its purpose _ to keep stars with their teams.
</P>
<P>
   Now no player can earn more than $14 million in the first year
of a deal. The playing field is leveled, and teams' budgets will be
intact. If this were the case a year ago, maybe the Nuggets
wouldn't have shipped McDyess _ then presumed to be out of their
price range _ to the Phoenix Suns. And perhaps Karl Malone, who
threatened to go anywhere that would pay $20 million a year, won't
abandon the Jazz when he becomes a free agent this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Longer rookie deals: Starting with the class of '98, rookie
contracts will be four to five years, instead of three. That means
teams won't have to turn the franchise over to a prospect before
he's proven his worth (Garnett), or trade him away for fear of
overpaying and getting burned (McDyess, onetime Warrior Joe Smith).
</P>
<P>
   Cap exceptions: In a typical year, most teams are over the
salary cap, meaning they can only sign additional players to
minimum salaries and can't compete for free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The new middle-class exception, $1.75 million this season, is
available every year, and combined with the $1 million exception
(available once every two years), will allow capped-out teams like
the Lakers to pay veterans what they're worth. Last year, that
might have meant keeping Jerome Kersey, who left for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Opt-out clauses and timing rules: In some cases, players had
been able to option out of a contract after only three years. Now
they have to wait five years.
</P>
<P>
   The timing rules, which govern free agency, are more complicated
than calculus, but put it this way _ they've been altered to make
it more difficult for free agents to test their value on the open
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal kills free agency,'' said agent Marc Fleisher. ``The
only ones who benefit are the (players) under long-term guaranteed
contracts. Every other class of player out there is going to get
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   But fans, who couldn't keep up with their own teams' rosters in
an era of bedouins and mercenaries, win. And the folks in
Vancouver, Toronto, Denver and Sacramento might have hope restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like players not to be moving because of economic
disparity between teams, and we think that this (deal) is going to
eliminate the movement because of economic disparity,''
commissioner David Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be different judgment by teams as to what a player
is worth,'' added deputy commissioner Russ Granik, ``so I think
you'll still see movement because a player can get a better offer
somewhere else. But we'd like it to be because one team values a
player more highly ... rather than just because that team has a
greater ability to pay by a wide margin.''

BRUINS WARY OF THE WACKY AT MAC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Before addressing the present predicament, a few
words about UCLA's past failures in this quaint college town on the
Willamette River.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have lost four of their last five games at Oregon's
McArthur Court, where the Ducks play like hawks and the students
spew profanity and the unexpected has a season ticket. (See: USC
vs. Oregon, Jan. 7, 1999.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of UCLA's best teams have faltered in Mac Court. In 1995,
three months before winning the national title, coach Jim Harrick
was ejected and the Bruins imploded in the final minutes. At the
buzzer, students swarmed the floor and tried to pick a fight with
Tyus Edney's mother.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, two months before their Elite Eight appearance, the
Bruins lost in overtime and Ducks fans allegedly showered Kris
Johnson with racial slurs. Even mild-mannered Bruin Bob Meyers was
on the brink of brawling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bizarre things happen at Mac Court,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, UCLA's bus unloaded the players in front of the
arena, and they had to walk through a line of angry students. It
wasn't exactly a calming experience for five freshmen. ``I thought,
`Are you trying to get us killed?' '' guard Earl Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, the Bruins shuffled out with a 16-point loss.
</P>
<P>
   If the savviest UCLA teams failed in the din of Mac Court, how
will a team with 10 freshmen and sophomores survive?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: It may not, especially if it doesn't correct the
myriad problems that surfaced in a stunning 65-63 loss Thursday at
Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, the Bruins acted as if they'd just lost a
well-played game at California or Washington _ not a horrific
defeat to the league's worst team. They usually play their worst
game at OSU, but until this year they always found a way to win.
They always had an answer. Thursday, no answer. Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play as hard as we could have,'' sophomore guard
Rico Hines said. ``We were lackadaisical.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin blamed UCLA's 28 percent shooting and claimed that if the
Bruins had made a few more baskets, they'd be 3-0 in conference
play. After reviewing the tape, he said, it was apparent UCLA had
plenty of open shots that simply did not fall.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But that does not discount the myriad fundamental
problems that must be corrected before tipoff tonight. Against
Oregon State, the Bruins were stagnant and impatient on offense.
They were lazy and sloppy on defense, opting to foul rather than
move their feet. They were intimidated and indifferent and
attributed the performance to nerves, since it was their first road
game of the conference season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest factor was it was our first time in a hostile
environment,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gill Coliseum wasn't ``hostile.'' It was nothing of the sort
until the Beavers took a 10-point lead in the final minutes and
long-suffering fans smelled victory. For 30 minutes, Gill was as
quiet as a neutral court.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe indifference is just what the Bruins need. Maybe
indifference will speed their recovery. Lavin constantly warns
against mood swings, and there's no better time to avoid an
emotional bottoming than after losing the first game of a road
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to flush this out of our system,'' Hines said.
``That's the sign of a mature team. They beat us, and now we have a
game less than 48 hours later. It's a business trip now. We've got
to get a split.''

NORTHRIDGE TROUBLE COMES IN THREES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Cal State Northridge men's basketball team is
in a funk in which the offense regresses into nothing more than
ill-advised 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   You can count on an extended lapse of this type each game, which
is why the Matadors (9-6, 1-2 Big Sky) should feel fortunate to
have at least one conference win going into tonight's home game
with Eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an easy way out on offense,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell
said. ``Somehow we've got to get it figured out.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN is shooting 34.2 percent from 3-point range, a number that
dips to 32 percent during conference games.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not the inability to score that's hurting the
Matadors. It's the unwillingness to work for better shots.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Matadors rarely use more than 20 seconds of the
35-second shot clock before hoisting up a 3-pointer. They're
averaging 23 attempts from 3-point range in three conference games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we don't talk about, it's not that we don't work
on it every day in practice,'' Braswell said. ``Somehow we have to
figure out that when we get into this easy-way-out offense, or this
hero syndrome where we start casting up quick shots, we're not as
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when you're not defending, and you're taking quick, bad
shots, it's going to lead to losses, and that's what it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Schedule talk: CSUN's high-profile sports have the added
responsibility of making money to fund the nonrevenue sports, so
Matadors associate head coach Mike Johnson burns the phone lines
looking for guarantee games. He may have found one in Fresno State
for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really close,'' Johnson said. ``We're just working on
one or two things.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest issue remaining is the cash CSUN will receive for
playing at Fresno State, but Johnson said he expects a one-game
contract to be signed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Johnson said he's working on securing a
home-and-home series with Texas El-Paso. It would begin next season
with the dates and sites to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Lockout fallout: Because the NBA lockout was settled and the
season will begin in February, CSUN's game against Montana State
next Friday won't be shown on Fox Sports West.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds strange, but it's true. The network was working on plans
to air the game, which is being broadcast by Fox Sports Northwest,
until the NBA owners and players settled.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Fox Sports West spokesperson, CSUN's game got
scrapped because the network now must fulfill other contract
obligations before the NBA season begins. Instead of certain things
airing in February and March, those events will air in January, a
spokesperson said.

<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Ring the Bell (Mark). Raise the Rufus
(Porter). Beat down the Doornink (Dan).
</P>
<P>
   Hip hip Herrera (Efren). The Seattle Seahawks no longer wallow
in the Mirer (Rick). They have emerged from the NFL Raible (Steve)
prepared to shoot the Moon (Warren).
</P>
<P>
   In Kirkland Friday, Springs (Shawn) sprung and horns were Tuten
(Rick).
</P>
<P>
   OK, so hyperbole rules the day. What the Heck (Andy). In the
mostly tepid history of the NFL in Seattle, hundreds of names have
come and gone. Most were little noted and not long remembered. None
were the game's biggest.
</P>
<P>
   Until Slash Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president of football operations/general manager/head
coach/prime minister/prom king/lama/ /sheriff-of-Nottingham, the
large man acquired the largest job with the largest salary in the
NFL, at least among those who don't dirty themselves on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   What for? The guy is no Brian Bosworth. His hair is unstriped
and unicolored, fergawdsakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instant respect,'' said Seahawk running back Ricky Watters.
</P>
<P>
   Instant respect. A simple idea, way overemphasized in the jock
world, but something the Seahawks haven't had in a decade, locally
or nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Instant respect isn't cheap. It will cost owner Paul Allen more
than $30 million over eight years, it cost president Bob Whitsitt
some prestige, it cost vice president Randy Mueller some authority,
it cost Dennis Erickson and most of his assistants their coaching
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But from the looks on the faces at the team's headquarters, from
the ringing of the ticket-sales phones, from the buzz throughout
the football nation, instant respect seemed a worthy investment.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the force of Holmgren's accomplishments, personality and
character that the entire franchise bent to accommodate him.
</P>
<P>
   Big money, many years and huge responsibilities for a premier
figure in the business add up to an astonishing, locally
unprecedented commitment to an athletic renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Between Friday and the day of the Behring moving trucks was
almost three years by calendar. But from the standpoint of
progress, the Seahawks have gone abruptly from abacus to laptop.
</P>
<P>
   The swiftness with which the Seahawks moved to yank Holmgren
from the tradition-encrusted Green Bay Packers, who had suffered a
wrenching defeat that ended their season last Sunday, to this
history-free NFL outpost was more than a statement about his
stature in the game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It was a statement about how annoyed the franchise bosses were
during the first two years of Allen's tenure. To the software
crowd, two years is like the passing of a generation. Even by NFL
standards, with 23 teams making the playoffs during Erickson's four
seasons, the Seahawks were slow on the uptake.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very short time, I realized these men like to get things
done,'' Holmgren said of his meetings with Allen, Whitsitt and the
rest. ``That's how I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's the right fit, it's the right fit. You know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt reached the same conclusion in the same short time. In
the year since the Seahawks sought to fill the vacant post of
general manager, he maintained his preference was that one man not
hold both jobs of GM and coach. But his position started to shift
after the regular season ended, when he saw how close Holmgren was
to shoveling out of the frozen tundra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never met Mike Holmgren until Wednesday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Whitsitt had turned over the keys to the whole
football works and headed to Portland, where his NBA Trail Blazers
were emerging from their various lockouts, jails, rehab programs
and paternity suits.
</P>
<P>
   For Whitsitt to make such a reversal, and surrender
responsibility, the fit must have been perfect. For a time during
his presidency of the Sonics, he wore so many hats that his neck
bowed from the weight. His habit is to seek more power, not less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with his intellect and understanding,''
Whitsitt said. ``He seriously thought about doing both jobs. He's
not a guy who just says, `Gee, this sounds neat.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He also made an impression when he admitted not having all the
answers _ something his followers might be surprised to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when I'm interviewing someone, I need to to hear, `I
don't know,''' Whitsitt said. ``He said there were things about
(the dual role) he'd have to learn on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time went on, I really felt comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Not an easy development for a control freak. But whatever
misgivings Whitsitt had were no match for the lack of respect he,
Allen and the rest of the franchise felt about being a backwater
outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perfect organizational structure,'' he said, ``is getting
the best people you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks would appear to be approaching that, from a
committed owner to an aggressive president to a football mastermind
to a talented roster of experienced players.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a thing Friday, watching a man trade in his
cheesehead for a bag of slug bait. Imagine the feeling when the
Seahawks trade third-and-11 for first-in-AFC West.

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After an extraordinary bipartisan caucus that
lasted about three hours, the Senate voted unanimously Friday to
approve a plan for President Clinton's impeachment trial that calls
for opening arguments to begin on Thursday and defers a decision on
whether to summon witnesses until later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement averted further confrontation over rival
Republican and Democratic trial plans that had threatened to send
the Senate into the same partisan spiral as the House. The two
sides had been deeply divided over whether to allow witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief session presided over by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist late Friday afternoon, the senators approved the plan
they had outlined earlier in the Old Senate Chamber, where the
Senate had met throughout the early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   An official summons directing Clinton to respond to the two
articles of impeachment against him was delivered to the White
House by James Ziglar, the Senate sergeant-at-arms.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Democrats were wary of the blueprint, many
senators from both parties reveled in institutional pride at
maintaining a conciliatory tone that had eluded the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we didn't ask for this trial,'' said Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt. ``We didn't ask for the president to conduct himself
the way he did, and we didn't ask for the House to make a mishmash
of this thing. But all that's happened and now we have to preserve
the Senate and give the country a sense of credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding the same note, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said: ``I
think there's a feeling in this situation that the Senate is on
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in a terse, carefully worded statement, said
Friday afternoon that it respected the Senate's decision. ``In
accordance with the procedures adopted by the Senate, we plan to
present on behalf of the president a vigorous, successful and
complete defense,'' said Gregory Craig, the special White House
counsel, in an appearance in the White House drive shortly after 5.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had hoped that the Senate would settle on an
abbreviated trial without witnesses, confined to the material
submitted by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. White House
aides waited anxiously while the senators met privately on Friday,
and some acknowledged disappointment at the procedure that emerged.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig said the White House was confident that the Senate
would move to cut off the proceeding after the opening
presentations, rather than extend the trial and call witnesses.
``We remain hopeful that this matter can be resolved expeditiously
and fairly,'' he said, before turning his back and walking
resolutely away from shouted questions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate plan approved Friday, the trial of Clinton on
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from his
efforts to hide his affair with Monica Lewinsky would get under way
in earnest on Wednesday with arguments on any procedural pretrial
motions by House prosecutors or White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning the next day, the House has 24 hours to present its
case against the president. Clinton's legal team follows with its
allotted 24 hours. Both sides are precluded from introducing new
evidence unrelated to the impeachment record established in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Senators then will have 16 hours to question the two sides by
sending written queries to Rehnquist, who will be at the presiding
officer's chair in the front of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   At that point _ expected to be either Jan. 25 or Jan. 26 _
senators plan to debate and vote on two separate motions, first a
motion to adjourn the trial and next a motion on whether to call
witnesses. Those votes would be simple majority votes.
</P>
<P>
   If witnesses are approved, the House prosecutors or the White
House would question them first in a deposition. Sen. Tom Daschle,
the minority leader, said a second majority vote would be required
to have witnesses testify before the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who had previously stood adamantly against witnesses,
are taking solace in the fact that if witnesses are to be called at
all, they will initially have to be approved all at once, in a
group, which they believe would discourage the House from seeking
to call too many. They also anticipate that the senators _ sitting
as jurors under a vow of silence _ will have a diminishing appetite
for witnesses after listening to the House and White House for two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one thing the Senate can't tolerate and that's
remaining quiet for very long,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn. ``And the idea they are going to sit there day after day
and listen to House managers and White House counsels, with their
inability to respond, is not going to last very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the leader of the House impeachment managers,
said, ``We intend to use the time we have been provided to present
a compelling case on the serious charges pending against the
president. We also look forward to the opportunity _ with Senate
concurrence _ to call witnesses in support of evidence. The House
managers have said they want to call anywhere from five to 15
witnesses ranging from Ms. Lewinsky to an array of current and
former White House advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote brought to an end weeks of uncertainty and
contention over how the first presidential impeachment trial since
1868 should proceed. On Thursday the two sides had scheduled votes
on competing Republican and Democratic plans, but then pulled back.

QUESTIONS, ANSWERS ON HOLMGREN'S HIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question: Will the hiring of Mike Holmgren get the Seahawks back
on ``Monday Night Football'' for the first time since 1992?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The NFL schedule won't be released until late March or
early April, but the Seahawks do play at Green Bay next season and
you know ABC will be lobbying to get Holmgren's return in prime
time. How about the Seahawks vs. the Packers on the first Monday
night of the season?
</P>
<P>
   Question: Does Holmgren's hiring set the table for the return of
quarterback Rick Mirer? Mirer, who the Seahawks drafted with the
No. 2 overall pick in the 1993 NFL draft, has been Holmgren's pet
project in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: No. No. No. A thousand times, no.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Will Holmgren fill his staff with Packer assistants,
or retain some of the Seahawks assistants who remain under
contract?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Both. Holmgren definitely will bring some of his Packer
assistants with him. But it is likely that he also will retain at
least one or two of the Seahawk assistants. Also count on him
bringing in an assistant or two from other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Question: With Holmgren getting the dual title of executive vice
president/general manager and head coach, what does that mean for
Randy Mueller, the club's vice president of football operations who
has been handling the duties of a general manager without the
title?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Nothing. As club president Bob Whitsitt put it:
``Randy's still Randy. Instead of reporting to Dennis (Erickson),
he reports to Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: What did Holmgren's hiring do for season-ticket sales?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The Seahawks ticket office sold 275 new season-ticket
packages in the first three hours after Holmgren was hired. The
total reached 848 by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Thursday night's dinner at the Mercer Island estate of
owner Paul Allen was the piece de resistance in landing Holmgren.
Just what does a multi-billionaire serve for dinner?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: As Holmgen offered: ``As the dinner went along, each
course was described. But it was described in French, so I had no
idea what I was eating. It was pretty good, though.''

 WASHINGTON: pulled back.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And so Friday began with a last attempt to reach across party
lines in the ceremonial room that served as the Senate chamber
between 1810 and 1859, when some of the great debates and
confrontations over slavery took place. The chamber was placed
under heavy security. Folding chairs supplemented the permanent
seats to accommodate the senators, whose number was greater than
that of their counterparts in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   A few Republicans assured Democrats that despite the House
prosecutors' insistence on witnesses, they too did not want a
sordid discussion of sex to take place in the Senate chamber.
``What was helpful in the room was for the Democrats to learn there
are a whole lot of Republicans who are not anxious to have a bunch
of witnesses either,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators said the sense of the history of the room helped
foster an atmosphere where they could come together. ``Every
senator knows the level of oratory and the weight of the issues
discussed here,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``It helped
all the senators put this in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd reminded his colleagues that ``one of the saddest moments
in Senate history'' had taken place in the room _ the caning of
Sen. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts by Preston Brooks of South
Carolina. ``Many historians feel that was when the comity in the
Senate broke down, leading three and a half years later to the
commencement of the Civil War,'' he said later.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, said the breakthrough came
when an unusual pair _ Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts liberal,
and Phil Gramm, a Texas conservative _ made back-to-back
statements. ``I describe it as the Kennedy-Gramm or the
Gramm-Kennedy proposal,'' Lott told reporters. He then stressed the
bizarre notion of these two ideological opposites working together,
by saying with relish, ``Did you hear what I said?''
</P>
<P>
   Other senators said Gramm pointed out that under Senate
impeachment rules a vote on witnesses could always be demanded by
any party _ there was no way around it. Kennedy agreed that the
Texan was right and started suggesting ways to make the witness
situation more palatable to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the Democrats who moved the most, to accept a
proposal much like the one the Republicans had originally drafted.
And some Senate Democrats expressed private annoyance that Kennedy
had been so quick to support Gramm because they thought he gave
away a tactical advantage stemming from the Republicans'
unwillingness to look as partisan as their House counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic official close to the developments said the White
House as well had been trying to get Democrats to forgo the display
of bipartisanship. But Senate Democrats said they felt they had won
the best deal they could so that Republicans would appear to be
promoting a partisan trial. Some made clear that they had more
allegiance to the Senate as an institution than to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, said, when asked about White
House grumbling. ``They have no say.'' He added, ``We're not here
to defend either the White House or the House of Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle pointed to provisions in the agreement that his party
considered important. He noted that the impeachment trial would be
limited to evidence that was already in the public record and that
witnesses would be considered in a group.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the House Republican prosecution team had argued
to bring forward an unsubstantiated allegation of an uncorroborated
sexual encounter between Clinton and a woman years ago. The woman
has denied the accusation in an affidavit. Although it was not a
part of the House proceedings, several undecided House members were
shown the information as they weighed how to vote on impeachment.
The Senate agreement will bar such matters since they are not part
of the House impeachment record.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the voting also mollified Democrats. Kennedy said
that in the afternoon of drafting, Gramm had originally wanted to
have the vote on witnesses come toward the beginning of the trial.
The Democrats rejected that idea, so the plan calls for the vote on
witnesses to take place after two weeks of presentations by the
House and the White House. Daschle said that he believed the case
against witnesses would be stronger at that point.
</P>
<P>
   The House has pressed for witnesses even though it did not call
any in its own inquiry. Hyde has said that the House's role was
simply to determine whether to bring charges against Clinton, not
to try him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton advisers also said that unlike the House, the Senate had
structured a procedure under which the White House could win.
Senators, unlike members of the House, retain the option to censure
Clinton, rather than simply vote to convict or acquit him. That may
make it easier, White House aides believe, for a majority of
senators to vote to dismiss the charges against Clinton after
hearing the presentations.
</P>
<P>
   The White House remains fearful, though, that the Senate will
ultimately choose to call witnesses, with the result that the trial
could drag out.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the brokering that went on throughout the day,
Senators held to the idea that the impeachment trial was a historic
moment for the Senate and that they had to rise to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe that the Senate can restore some order to the
anger which has overtaken the country and the chaos which threatens
this city,'' Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., told his colleagues in
the morning caucus. ``I believe in all of you. I believe that all
of the courage and conviction needed to handle any crisis is
present right in this room.''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end Lott, who has been trying for weeks to broker a
bipartisan agreement, said in satisfaction, ``I think today we have
acted in the very best tradition of the Senate, and it is an
appropriate approach for this historic, very solemn event.''

WHERE IS JORDAN AND WHAT ARE HIS PLANS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to add new last graf. No other changes.)  (Eds: See also BKN-SEASON) 
(mk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Jordan has disappeared. It's not the first time. Usually
when Michael Jordan vanishes, he's overhead, soaring in his
customary Air Jordan, First in Flight fashion. People now are
looking for Jordan because they want an answer to the question they
have been asking since he sank the winning jump shot from the top
of the key in the final game of the 1998 National Basketball
Association championship series in Salt Lake City in June.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the question most prominent in basketball circles is:
Will M.J. or won't M.J. play basketball for profit again? Or is he
retired from the game, the Bulls, the NBA and fans' hoop hearts
once and for all? That is, has he gone finally over the hill,
lugging his mashie and niblick and hoping to triumph over par
instead of torturing people like the Knicks?
</P>
<P>
   A call to the Chicago Bulls' office elicited this reply: ``He's
not around here as far as we know. There was a rumor he was in New
York. But last we heard he was in the Bahamas playing golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's agent, David Falk, said by phone Friday that Jordan was
``out of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't be back until early next week,'' Falk added, ``and he
won't make a decision until he returns. How soon after that will he
decide, I have no idea. I'm not sure he does. But for now, he's
sitting on a $50 million cap with the Bulls, and they can't really
sign anyone until he decides.''
</P>
<P>
   Others yet to be signed by the Bulls include two additional
stars of their recent championship teams, Scottie Pippen and Dennis
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has had quite a long time to consider whether he will
come back but, Falk said, ``things were up in the air with the
lockout. So Michael will make his decision when he feels
comfortable. He wants to be careful and make the right decision for
himself. It's his career, it's his future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamas had previously been checked out. A caller to the
hotel where Jordan was supposed to be staying asked for Michael
Jordan. ``Sorry,'' came the reply, ``no one by that name is
registered.'' The caller then asked for the alias Jordan often
uses.
</P>
<P>
   The receptionist said the person registered under that name had
checked out.
</P>
<P>
   Someone in the upper reaches of Bulls management said privately
the other day that he did not believe Jordan was going to return to
basketball. Charles Barkley said Jordan had told him that it was
curtains for his career. Billy Hunter, executive director of the
players association, said he believed Jordan probably would be
back.
</P>
<P>
   And Jordan may not tip his hand until the new collective
bargaining agreement is signed in a few days and teams go back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that Jordan's return hinges on whether Pippen
returns to the Bulls. Jordan has never won a championship _ he has
six in the last eight years _ without his smooth forward. Pippen
has said he will never play for the Bulls again because he bears
such enmity toward management, but he has said on more than one
occasion that he would never play for the Bulls again, and has.
(Some believe that Pippen's decision hinges on Jordan's.)
</P>
<P>
   Early last season, Jordan said he would not entertain thoughts
of playing another season if Phil Jackson did not return as the
Bulls' coach. Jackson has made it definite that he will not return.
Jordan, meanwhile, has changed his tune, saying he might play for
another coach if he felt like it.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bulls coach will surely be Tim Floyd, and Jordan has
said he was impressed with what Floyd had been doing _ studying the
Jackson style of play, which would make Jordan comfortable _ and
what Floyd had been saying (Floyd had been effusive in his praise
for Jackson and Jordan).
</P>
<P>
   And then others contend that the perfect way for any great
athlete to go out is when on top. Jordan certainly did that last
season, hitting the winner in the final game. Not only that, but at
age 35, he was the league's leading scorer for the 10th time and
the most valuable player for the fifth time. And the MVP in the
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is playing as well or better an all-round game than he
ever has. While he does not ascend above the hoop as frequently, he
can still lift off when the occasion arises.
</P>
<P>
   And he loves the competition. His late father once said, ``My
son doesn't have a gambling problem, he has a competition
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In a shortened, 50-game regular season, Jordan would not have to
work quite as hard or as often as before. He remains in excellent
shape.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, the lockout and the labor battle have left fans
with a taste of ashes in their mouths. Not only do the Bulls need
Jordan, but the league feels it does. Even rival players hope
Jordan will come back to ease tensions and excite the cash
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan may feel some allegiance to the NBA _ after all, it gave
him his global platform _ but, even more, Jordan relishes coming
through when he's needed most.
</P>
<P>
   When the horn sounds to signal the start of the new season,
don't be surprised if the fans crane their necks and see this sight
in the distance: Michael Jordan, baggy pants flapping in the
breeze, on his way into the game, the one-man cavalry to the
rescue. &QL;

IN BOW TO REALITY, NBA ALLOWS TALKS WITH AGENTS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs to add 7 grafs to end. No other changes.)   (bl) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fearing a mad scramble for free agents three weeks before the
season is scheduled to begin, the National Basketball Association
agreed Friday to permit teams to negotiate with player agents
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   From Michael Jordan to Zan Tabak, the decision opens the
floodgates for nearly 200 players to negotiate new contracts
through their agents. No deals can be signed until the new
collective bargaining agreement is set in writing sometime next
week. And the moratorium for players having contact with teams
remains in effect until training camps are scheduled to begin Jan.
18.
</P>
<P>
   But the cloak-and-dagger methods of many agents and team
executives will end this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After consulting with the union, and aware that talks were
already secretly going on after Wednesday's settlement that saved
the season, the league sent memorandums to the 29 teams about 5
p.m. Friday advising them that negotiations could proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was obviously such pent-up demand that it wasn't worth
fighting about,'' one league official said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has yet to decide whether he will retire, but a
free-agent class that includes Antonio McDyess, Scottie Pippen,
Dennis Rodman, Damon Stoudamire and Jayson Williams is about to
experience the NBA's version of Job Fair '99, replete with the
usual inducements and recruiting tactics from prospective
employers.
</P>
<P>
   One agent, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Nets
were keenly interested in acquiring McDyess, the skywalking forward
whose youth and athleticism make him perhaps the No. 1 commodity.
Phoenix and Denver, teams McDyess has played for, were also in the
bidding, as was Houston. The Nets are planning to keep Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Sexton, Pippen's agent, said there was a possibility his
client would return to the Chicago Bulls when the 50-game,
lockout-delayed season is scheduled to open Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie loves Chicago, loves the team and so, if we can work a
deal out that works for Scottie, I think he would like to stay
there,'' Sexton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, Orlando Magic and Rockets have only four players
apiece under contract, while the Suns have five.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Kasten, the Atlanta Hawks president, told The Associated
Press that he was suspicious that other teams were getting a jump
on negotiations in violation of the rules. He said he had spoken
with Commissioner David Stern about the situation and vowed to turn
in any team that breaks the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that teams and players were secretly negotiating for the
past 48 hours, the league deemed the moratorium as unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got lesser guys that I need to get into camps,'' said
Eric Rudolph, an agent who represents the free agents Johnny
Newman, Kebu Stewart and Shawnelle Scott. ``It just makes sense to
lift the moratorium. I'd like to be able to negotiate. So now, when
the 18th comes, it's like a formality of cutting their deals. A lot
of GMs were pushing hard for it for no other reason than they
wanted to find out if a certain player was interested in their
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Said another agent, on condition of anonymity: ``Whether they
lifted it or not, I'm just telling you we've been going about
business. So have a lot of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden State is said to be trying hard to trade Latrell
Sprewell, with Miami and San Antonio the most interested. The
controversial All-Star guard has not played since November 1997
after choking and punching his coach, P.J. Carlesimo, and
subsequently being suspended for the remainder of last season. His
contract was originally terminated as well, but an arbitrator
sharply reduced the penalty and allowed Sprewell to return to
Golden State contractually. The Warriors have been trying to deal
him since.
</P>
<P>
   The season is expected to start in four weeks, and the playoffs
could end in late June or early July. Leading up to that date, the
face of the league may change considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte is in the most trouble regarding free agents, with
both centers Vlade Divac and Matt Geiger fielding offers from
several teams.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls remain the most intriguing subplot, with nine
players on the open market. The feeling among most team officials
is that if Jordan and Pippen somehow are retained, the club will
try to sign Rodman, Steve Kerr, Bill Wennington and Luc Longley to
attempt a run for a fourth consecutive title. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the decision Friday, teams were, in theory, allowed to put
together deals Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It eliminates any need for investigation,'' the agent Keith
Glass said. ``Obviously, people have been sitting around for six
months doing nothing. So it's eliminated any hypocrisy. It puts
everybody on equal footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I've been calling and wishing people a Happy New Year
just to get a conversation going, and I think they're questioning
my sincerity.''
</P>
<P>
   The collective bargaining agreement included salary maximums for
the game's highest-paid players, eliminating the glut of $100
million deals that the owners claimed had crippled NBA economics.
</P>
<P>
   A player with 10 years of experience can make no more than $14
million in the first year of his deal _ with the possibility for
annual 12 percent raises. With restrictions like those, some league
officials said they believed that the need for agents would be
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Glass, for one, was not buying that theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like city rats, we're very adaptable,'' he said. ``We
can live anywhere in any deal. We will survive. They can't
exterminate us.'' &QL;

SEAHAWKS MAKE HOLMGREN TOP PAID 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it was the seven-year itch. Maybe it was a chance to earn
the highest salary ever for a National Football League coach.
Maybe, as Mike Holmgren said, despite all his success he wanted to
achieve more.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the opportunity arrived Friday when
Holmgren, after seven winning seasons as the Green Bay Packers'
coach, signed as the executive vice president, general manager and
head coach of the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren had a year left on a contract that paid him $2 million
this season. But he also had a clause that allowed him to pursue
another head coaching job until Jan. 25 if he also became the
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks wanted Holmgren, and they talked to him first. The
Baltimore Ravens and the Philadelphia Eagles expected to talk to
him within days. Instead, Holmgren signed an eight-year contract
with Seattle that is said to be worth $4 million a year. Holmgren's
contract with the Packers requires the Seahawks to send the Packers
a second-round draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old Holmgren heads the National Football League's
coaching scale. The previous leader was George Seifert, who signed
on Monday with the Carolina Panthers for a reported $2.5 million a
year. Until then, the NFL's highest-paid coaches were also general
managers _ Bill Parcells of the Jets at $2.4 million a year and
Jimmy Johnson of the Miami Dolphins at $2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren had said he would return to the Packers unless he found
a job that combined the head of football operations with the head
coach position. While thanking the Packers for giving him his first
head coaching job, Holmgren said: ``It's been a real honest
relationship the whole way. They knew at some point in my career I
would like to have the job I'm privileged to have now.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, the day after the regular season ended, the Seahawks
dismissed their coach, Dennis Erickson, after four seasons with
records of 8-8, 7-9, 8-8 and 8-8. The Seahawks have gone 10 years
without reaching the playoffs, the longest current drought in the
league. They were also troubled by poor talent decisions on rookies
and free agents.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Seahawks spent $15 million on signing bonuses
alone for such heralded free agents as running back Ricky Watters,
center Kevin Glover, offensive guard Brian Habib, linebacker Darrin
Smith and punter Jeff Feagles.
</P>
<P>
   Of those five, only Feagles, who averaged 44.1 yards a punt, had
a season that might have pleased Paul Allen, the team owner and
co-founder of Microsoft. Watters had an uneventful 1,000-yard
rushing season. Glover missed seven games because of injuries and
Smith missed four. Habib drew frequent penalties.
</P>
<P>
   While the Seahawks were foundering, the Packers were winning.
Holmgren, inheriting a losing team, posted records of 9-7, 9-7,
9-7, 11-5, 13-3, 13-3 and 11-5. His last six teams made the
playoffs, two reached the Super Bowl and one won it. This season,
the Packers lost to the San Francisco 49ers, 30-27, in a wild-card
game.
</P>
<P>
   At Green Bay, General Manager Ron Wolf said he had no timetable
for naming a new coach. He did say: ``This isn't going to be like
one of these little high school prom things where you are picking
the best looking or the most compatible. You have to get somebody
of championship caliber and championship quality.''

NEW YORK COLUMN: STREET NAME FOR IMPASSE: HOMELESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Feinberg lives in a tiny room. He has a bed, a
dresser and a stand where his television shares space with a dozen
amber medicine bottles. Not much, but infinitely more than what he
had four years ago, when he drifted on the streets, marking the
change from summer to winter by migrating from breezy boardwalk in
Brooklyn to the subway stations of midtown. Back then he suffered
from infections, heart palpitations, anxiety attacks and seizures.
Sometimes, all he did was sob.
</P>
<P>
   His troubles began when he lost his job as a supermarket clerk.
Then his girlfriend died, and he ran through his savings to give
her a proper burial. With no money or prospects, he just left his
Brooklyn apartment one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``After six months, I didn't know what time it was,'' he said.
``I used to fall on the street. But I had nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent two years on the streets until some outreach workers
persuaded him to get help. He arrived a year and a half ago at
Euclid Hall, a single room occupancy hotel on the Upper West Side,
where he found a haven and people who make sure he takes his
medicine and keeps his appointments. He now boasts that he does a
lot for himself, and he no longer worries about wandering the
subways.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to walk the subways,'' he said. ``If I went to
the subway, I'd die. I don't think I would last two days on the
subways anymore. My doctor said I can't do that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he has a doctor, as well as a room and counselors
to help him, was made possible through New York/New York, a city
and state partnership that built nearly 4,000 housing units for
mentally ill homeless people. City officials would like to build at
least 1,750 more apartments, but they have reached an impasse with
state officials over the state's part of the program. The city is
willing to spend $51 million and would like the state to provide
twice as much, as it did in the program's first phase. The state,
however, has stuck to its current commitment of $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   This has created uncertainty among those who advocate for and
care for the homeless mentally ill, who said that the disagreement
will only delay the construction of housing while the state moves
to release thousands of patients from its psychiatric hospitals.
They said that with little new housing in the pipeline, people may
have few options beyond living unsupervised on their own or moving
in with parents who are older and ill prepared to care for them.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Coe, the executive director of Community Access, an
advocacy and housing group, said this week's arrest of Andrew
Goldstein, who is charged with shoving a woman to her death in
front of a subway train, was an extreme example of what can happen
when people with psychiatric problems are left to live without
adequate support. Goldstein, a schizophrenic, was said to have
rented a room in a Queens home where he kept to himself and
sometimes did not take his medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you provide people with a decent place to live and people
who care about you, people are able to acquire skills and have some
sort of productive activity,'' he said. ``Somebody like Andrew,
living by himself in a room, he does not have access to those
resources to help him negotiate the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Coe belongs to a coalition that is urging public officials to
embark on a five-year program to build 10,000 more housing units,
an ambitious goal given the current deadlock. But supporters of the
movement said that while such an effort might sound expensive, it
was a worthwhile long-term investment, especially given current
budget surpluses. What was not as abundant, they said, was the
political will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this frustrating mentality in the political sphere
where people want to make decisions that will have a quick impact
and generate political benefits to them,'' said the Rev. Alistair
Drummond, the moderator of the Presbytery of New York City. ``The
debate has degenerated into simple arguments about resources and
demands on a limited budget. People talk about budget surpluses,
yet there is not even a sense of moral obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinberg prefers to talk about his new home, where the common
kitchen is spotless and his room is warm. He thinks it's a big
deal, considering the alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other place for people to go,'' he said. ``You go
to the subway and the people are all mental cases. Not that they're
mental, but they get no nourishment and give up. You know what I'm
talking about? They give up.''

ROBITAILLE'S RUN FOR 500 STARTED WITH RV TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At campgrounds across America last summer, the
embarrassed-looking inline skater was a revitalized fitness
fanatic.
</P>
<P>
   At Big Sur, with weights draped around his neck, the star left
wing of the Los Angeles Kings was recognized by some vacationers,
and was the recipient of sidelong glances from others.
</P>
<P>
   And within the shadow of Mt. Rushmore, Luc Robitaille set up his
weight-lifting equipment a slap shot beneath the likeness of former
presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and
Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation for Robitaille's summer of pain and gain was
simple: He wanted to better prepare for his final pursuit of
hockey's coveted 500-goal mark, which he reached by scoring twice
in Thursday night's 4-2 victory over the Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew he needed to play better,'' said Joe Horrigan, the
strength and conditioning specialist Robitaille turned to for help.
``And as his training progressed, so did his attitude. By July, he
was saying, `I'm going to score 40 or 50 goals.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As outlandish as that might have seemed at the time, Robitaille
_ the 27th player and sixth left wing to score 500 goals _ is well
on his way after scoring only 40 goals the previous two seasons
combined. Robitaille has scored 22 goals in 39 games, and enters
tonight's game at the Forum against the Edmonton Oilers with 12
goals in his past 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to make the NHL. I never thought, `I want to get
to 500 goals,' '' the 13-year veteran said. ``I think one day when
I retire, I'll look at a guy like Maurice Richard, to be in the
same numbers as him, it's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to Robitaille's success this season was his summer
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, Horrigan performed baseline tests on Robitaille so
he'd be able to chart his client's progress over time.
</P>
<P>
   Horrigan had Robitaille skate from the goal line to the near
blue line _ a distance of 60 feet _ and clocked him at 3.0 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Horrigan _ who assumed Robitaille couldn't have lifted much more
than 135 pounds _ had Robitaille do a clean pull with an empty bar
(45 pounds).
</P>
<P>
   He started Robitaille at 55 pounds on a squat lift, assuming his
limit would have been less than 225.
</P>
<P>
   And he had Robitaille do three sets of sit-ups, 10 repetitions
each, holding a 10-pound weight. Robitaille never before had done
sit-ups holding a weight.
</P>
<P>
   How far has Robitaille progressed? According to Horrigan, in the
most recent testing, Robitaille skated from the goal line to the
near blue line in 2.67 seconds, did a clean pull of 315 pounds, was
close to 400 pounds in the squat, and did three sets of sit-ups, 10
repetitions each, holding a 70-pound weight.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of training camp in September, the difference in
Robitaille's performance was obvious. Robitaille _ who added 15
pounds of muscle to his 6-foot-1, 215-pound frame _ has been
quicker to reach loose pucks, and has looked stronger when he's had
to battle for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest difference I feel is, a year or even 10 years ago,
in 80 games, there probably would be 40 or 50 games where I felt
great, 100 percent,'' Robitaille said. ``And the other 30 games,
I'd feel sluggish or feel tired, and I'd get by somehow. Now, so
far this year, I can't say there's one game where I really felt
sluggish. Every game, I've felt strong physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Rob Blake _ Robitaille's workout partner on the road
_ added, ``If you watch him in the corners, instead of a guy being
beside him, the guy is behind him. Luc's gains are measured in
inches, but when you're as talented as he is, that's all you
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Horrigan's main concern as last summer began was the month-long
vacation Robitaille was planning with his wife, Stacia, and their
two sons, 10-year-old Steven and Jesse, 3. Robitaille was eager to
spend time with his family, crisscrossing the United States in a
rented motor home. For Horrigan, the trip represented potential
lost time.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's solution was simple: He purchased weight-lifting
equipment, packed his inline skates and hit the road. Each day,
Steven and Jesse would help their father set up his equipment
outside the motor home, and the workout would begin, lasting
anywhere from 60 to 90 minutes. As their father worked out, the
family sometimes would hide in the motor home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not coming out with you doing this stuff,'' they would
tell Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit embarrassing at some of the campgrounds,''
Robitaille recalled. ``People were coming in with their tents and
they were looking at me with this big motor home and my big squat
rack outside. I was the only one doing that, that's for sure. A few
people would come up to me. They thought it was some kind of jack
to lift the motor home. They didn't know what the heck it was. It
was kind of funny, actually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up north in Big Sur and there were people there from
L.A. and they recognized me. But mostly, I would get some funny
looks more than anything. We went all the way to Mt. Rushmore. Some
days were more embarrassing than others. But I knew it was
important. It's important for my career. It was something I had to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of his career, Robitaille had shunned lifting weights
once the season began, under the belief that conserving energy was
his most important task. Under Horrigan's direction, Robitaille has
learned not to exercise to the point of exhaustion, limiting
sessions to 25 minutes and riding the stationary bicycle daily, but
for no more than 20 minutes a day.
</P>
<P>
   He drains himself on the rink, not in the gym, and his efforts
on the ice already have netted Robitaille as many goals as some of
his friends thought him capable of scoring in an entire 82-game
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept saying, `The league has changed, the league is
faster,''' Robitaille recalled. ``And it's true. The league has
changed. The defensemen are better and the goalies are better. So I
said, `Well, I'm going to have to get better, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   After his struggles last season, and in light of the fact that
he hasn't scored more than 24 goals in a season since 1993-94,
there was something else prodding Robitaille last summer when he
motored around America with family and weight-lifting gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt I had to prove something,'' said Robitaille,
who is talking these days about playing five more years. ``But if
you look at all the great players, they always feel they have to
prove something. If you look at anybody who's had any kind of
success in their life, they always want to prove something.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it says in the paper that Luc played bad last night, my
first thing will be, `I'll prove that they were wrong,' and I'll
play harder. And if it says I played a great game or I'm a great
player, the first thing I want to do is prove that it's right, so
I'll go harder. That's the mentality I have for the game.''

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   EMBASSY-BOMBS (Washington) _ A close examination of events in
the year before the terrorist assault on the Kenya embassy, based
on interviews with officials throughout the U.S. government, shows
that concerns about embassy security were more intense, more
well-founded, more specific, and more forcefully expressed than has
previously been known. A special report. A short version has also
moved, as EMBASSY-BOMBS-ABR. By James Risen and Benjamin Weiser.

</P>
<P>
   EMBASSY-CROWE (Washington) _ Special panels set up by the State
Department to investigate the bombings of two U.S. embassies in
Africa called on the department Friday to consider closing a number
of embassies around the world that are vulnerable to terrorist
attack and replacing them with regional ``super-embassies.'' By
Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   POLLARD-SENTENCE (Washington) _ Law enforcement and intelligence
officials said Friday that they remain adamantly opposed to
shortening the life sentence of Jonathan Jay Pollard, a former Navy
intelligence analyst convicted of spying for Israel. By David
Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-DAMAGE (Washington) _ Almost three weeks after the bombing
stopped, the Pentagon's senior commanders claimed on Friday that
the American and British raids on Iraq had caused more damage than
initially reported. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY-VATICAN (Rome) _ The new prime minister, an ex-Communist,
makes a formal visit to the pope as a sign of a new relationship
between the Roman Catholic Church and former Communists. By
Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-PIGEONS (Beijing) _ Recently 118 pigeons that made their
home in a public plaza outside a shopping mall suddenly died. The
shocking news was instant grist for front-page headlines in
Beijing's major newspapers. Ever since, generally fractious
Beijingers _ not known for their kindness to one another _ have
selflessly rallied in support of the birds in a period of outraged
mourning. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NY-READING-TEST (New York) _ A look at New York state's new
fourth-grade English exam, known in elementary schools simply as
The Test, which is to be given for the first time next week. Unlike
other standardized tests, this one requires students to take notes
on passages and write critiques and personal essays based on what
they heard. New York City may start using next year to determine
whether children should be held back a grade. By Randal C.
Archibold. With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   NY-HILLARY-POLITICS (New York) _ By most accounts, the prospect
of Mrs. Clinton seeking the Senate nomination is only the hopeful
figment of the imagination of Democrats contemplating the difficult
task of keeping Sen. Patrick Moynihan's seat under their party's
control. The first lady's associates say that Mrs. Clinton has
shown little interest in moving to New York and entering partisan
politics. It will probably be months before she offers a final word
on her political plans. By Adam Nagourney. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN (Undated) _ For the first half of 1998,
religious leaders and theologians had a low profile in the national
debate over President Clinton's sexual and legal misdeeds. But
starting on Sept. 11, when Clinton chose a breakfast meeting with
religious leaders as the occasion for his fullest admission of
wrongdoing and expression of remorse, the situation began to
change. By Peter Steinfels. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   GORE (Sioux City, Iowa) _ As the Senate debated how to conduct
an impeachment trial, the chamber's nominal president, Vice
President Al Gore, was 1,000 miles away Friday, talking about hogs,
methamphetamines and Social Security. Continuing an apparent White
House strategy to focus on policy as a way to divert attention from
events that could drive President Clinton from office, Gore spent
the day immersed in highly scripted appearances intended to reflect
an administration hard at work. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON _ (Moved in ``w'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH (Washington) _ After an extraordinary bipartisan caucus
that lasted about three hours, the Senate voted unanimously Friday
to approve a plan for President Clinton's impeachment trial that
calls for opening arguments to begin on Thursday and defers a
decision on whether to summon witnesses until later in the month.
By Alison Mitchell. With photos and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ASSESS (Washington) _ The road to a result the country
will consider adult, and fair, still has some rickety passages
ahead. And in the end, Republicans will cast all, or almost all, of
the votes to convict President Clinton and remove him from office,
while Democrats will cast most of the votes to acquit him and keep
him. If Friday's decision satisfied the Senate, it almost certainly
displeased the House managers and the White House. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CLINTON (Detroit) _ In the glow of more terrific
economic numbers, President Clinton proclaimed that all is well _
very well indeed _ showing once again just why he is popular, and
why removal from office is a very difficult goal for his opponents.
By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SCENE (Washington) _ The Senate rallied on Friday around
its own need for dignity. Having sought sanctuary from the
maddening politics of impeachment in a hallowed gaslight-era
chamber of the Capitol, the senators emerged three hours later
exulting in the rarest of news: The clash of President Clinton and
his House Republican accusers was far from settled, but at least
the nation would be treated to a moment of bipartisan unanimity. By
Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CANING (Washington) _ Appealing for a sense of harmony,
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., reminded colleagues gathered in
the Old Senate Chamber for a rare bipartisan caucus Friday that the
room was the scene of a ``tragic event'' in 1856: a brutal physical
assault by one member of Congress on another. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The economy added more jobs than
expected in December and the unemployment rate fell, tying a
28-year low. Payrolls increased by 378,000 jobs last month, well
above analysts' forecasts. The unemployment rate declined to 4.3
percent in December from 4.4 percent in November. By Sylvia Nasar.
With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   DOLLAR-DECLINE (Washington) _ Even while the stock market hits
new highs, a crucial indicator of foreign confidence in the U.S.
government and its economy _ the dollar _ has been falling. No one
can agree why. By David Sangar. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T-ACQUIRE (Undated) _ AT&AMP;T releases financial details of its
proposed acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. Contrary to its
original plan, AT&AMP;T will not issue a tracking stock for its
consumer business or for any of its other operations, though it
will mount a 3-for-2 split of its common stock after the deal is
completed. Also, the company says its earnings this year will
exceed expectations and that it has agreed to form joint ventures
with five small cable operators. By Seth Schiesel.
</P>
<P>
   MARKETS-ASIA (Hong Kong) _ The bulls finally stop stampeding
across Asia, but the recent sharp gains in stock prices from Seoul
to Singapore are worrying analysts, who are alarmed by the growing
disparity between the rising markets and Asia's still-sinking
economies. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMMENTARY (Moved in ``k'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RICH-COLUMN (Undated) _ Enough is enough. Move on. Let's get
back to the people's business. It's bad for the country. The
country is so bored it would rather watch ``Patch Adams.'' If
there's any consensus as we enter the last trial of the century, it
is this: Get it over with. By Frank Rich.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT (Moved in ``e'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COLD WAR
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, CNN will begin broadcasting the second half of
its 24-part documentary series ``Cold War.'' The first half has
already brought several angry critiques from historians and
commentators over how it interprets the Cold War and how it assigns
blame. The Times asked three historians with different perspectives
to assess the series. The stories were TV-COLDWAR-RADOSH,
TV-COLDWAR-GARDNER, TV-COLDWAR-GADDIS.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPORTS (Moved in ``s'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BRIBERY (Salt Lake City) _ The president and vice president
of the Salt Lake City Olympic committee, Frank Joklik and Dave
Johnson resign as the result of the continuing investigations into
the gifts and cash payments now linked to Salt Lake's winning bid
for the 2002 Winter Olympics. By Jere Longman.
</P>

   BKC-RHODEN-COLUMN (Washington) _ Sports of The Times column on
John Thompson, the Georgetown basketball coach who announced his
resignation today. By William C. Rhoden.
</P>
<P>
   BKC-HOYAS-THOMPSON (Washington) _ John Thompson, the Georgetown
basketball coach and a leading figure in coaching circles,
announces his resignation after a quarter of a century at the
school. By Judy Battista.
</P>
<P>
   BKN-JORDAN (Undated) _ Perhaps the question most prominent in
basketball circles is: Will M.J. or won't M.J. play basketball for
profit again? Or is he retired from the game, the Bulls, the NBA
and fans' hoop hearts once and for all? That is, has he gone
finally over the hill, lugging his mashie and niblick and hoping to
triumph over par instead of torturing people like the Knicks? By
Ira Berkow.

   &UR; SPECIAL REPORT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BKN-LABOR (Undated) _ The level of mistrust and animosity that
colored the NBA's ugly fight over how to split $2 billion in annual
revenues left many people, from fans to labor experts to marketing
executives, deeply puzzled: how could the league that fused pop
culture, entertainment and sports into an enormously popular
commercial product, allow itself to come apart so destructively?
But in truth, say players, agents and league officials, the

COMMENTARY: THE REAL DISGRACE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So there were the two of them, the one with the sparse and
unruly tufts of orange hair and the other with the silly yellow
stripes on the sleeves of his black robes, presuming to speak for
the nation about justice and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Someone should have dragged them off the public stage decades
ago. Dragged them off in disgrace. But there they were, front and
center once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you solemnly swear,'' said the 96-year-old Strom Thurmond,
``that in all things pertaining to the trial of William Jefferson
Clinton, now pending, that you will do impartial justice according
to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?''
</P>
<P>
   I felt like reaching for the Pepto-Bismol as this old-line
segregationist, now a U.S. senator, administered a solemn oath to a
fellow veteran of the campaigns to keep the heavy boot of
segregation firmly planted on the throats of black people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' said William Rehnquist, now the chief justice of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea where Thurmond's bigoted head has been, consider
that he not only opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
filibustered against it, he openly worried that it would lead to a
time when ``a woman of one race is required to give a massage to a
woman of another race against her wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Rehnquist, he had some lovely restrictions on property he
owned. The deed to a summer home he purchased in Vermont in 1974
contained a covenant that prohibited the sale or rental of the
property to ``any member of the Hebrew race.'' And the deed to his
home in Phoenix, Ariz., in the 1960s barred the sale or rental to
``any person not of the white or Caucasian race.''
</P>
<P>
   David Savage, in his book ``Turning Right: The Making of the
Rehnquist Supreme Court,'' notes that Rehnquist, at his
confirmation hearings in 1986, told the Senate Judiciary Committee
he hadn't examined his deeds and knew nothing of the covenants.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for a great legal mind?
</P>
<P>
   The essence of Rehnquist's early approach to matters racial was
spelled out most recently by Jeffrey Rosen in The New Yorker. In
the early '50s, as Brown vs. Board of Education was coming before
the Supreme Court, Rehnquist was a law clerk for Justice Robert
Jackson. In that capacity he prepared a memo that he called ``A
Random Thought on the Segregation Cases.''
</P>
<P>
   His random thought was that the boot of segregation should not
be lifted from the throats of American blacks. As Rosen says in his
article, ``Rehnquist wrote that the court should not be moved by
moral or social concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   In the memo, the future chief justice said, ``In the long run it
is the majority who will determine what the constitutional rights
of the minority are. I realize that it is an unpopular and
unhumanitarian position, for which I have been excoriated by
liberal colleagues, but I think Plessy vs. Ferguson [the legal
foundation for mandatory racial segregation) was right and should
be re-affirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when his confirmation as chief justice was on the
line, Rehnquist, in a cowardly move, would tell senators that the
memo represented Jackson's _ not Rehnquist's _ views.
</P>
<P>
   This canard was demolished in ``Simple Justice,'' Richard
Kluger's great history of the Brown vs. Board of Education case,
published in 1976. That did not prevent Rehnquist from apparently
lying through his teeth to save his judicial skin in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Rosen notes that Rehnquist, while being questioned by
Sen. Edward Kennedy and others, insisted under oath that the memo
represented Jackson's views.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy asked, ``Do the I's refer to you, Rehnquist?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I do not think they do,'' Rehnquist replied.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ugly racial stories having to do with Thurmond
and Rehnquist. Thurmond ran for president as a segregationist on
the Dixiecrat ticket because he thought civil rights had already
gone too far in 1948. Rehnquist was accused of intimidating black
voters in Arizona in the 1960s. The two of them were enemies of
black Americans and forgiveness in this corner comes slowly. Bill
Clinton has disgraced the office of the presidency, but to see the
likes of Thurmond and Rehnquist sitting in moral judgment of anyone
turns my stomach.

COMMENTARY: OF TANG AND THONGS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that impeachment has moved to the Senate, the
greatest deliberative body since Roman times, Peter and Dan and Tom
and Tim and Cokie and Greta keep telling me I should be awestruck
by the solemnity and majesty of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As moving as this was to watch on television,'' intoned Peter
Jennings, ``and it was moving ... .''
</P>
<P>
   They talked in sweeping terms about this moment in our lives we
would never forget, a day that would be recorded in bold print in
American history, about how the president's plight suddenly seemed
REAL.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know this is dead serious when you hear `Hear Ye, Hear
Ye,''' said NBC's Tim Russert. Well, Sue Me, Sue Me, but Hear Ye,
Hear Ye failed to send shivers down my spine.
</P>
<P>
   If I were describing the occasion, I would not use the words
moving, solemn, majestic, momentous, real, dead serious or bold.
</P>
<P>
   I would use the word OLD. I might use the word DEAD. I would not
talk about the extraordinary HUSH, but about the extraordinary
MUSH.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Revenge of the Grumpy Old Men.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, during the Thomas-Hill hearings, the curtain parted on
the Senate to reveal a sight at once grotesque and hilarious: a
bunch of out-of-touch old white guys trying to fathom truth in sex.
</P>
<P>
   It had the quality Dickens called ``the attraction of
repulsion.'' America was riveted by that bawdy seminar on the
perils of sex in the federal workplace. We thought those wrenching
hearings would illuminate gender politics and modernize the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Lo, these many years later, the curtain parts again. And,
LIKE HELLO, as Monica would say, what do we see but the grotesque
and hilarious sight of a bunch of out-of-touch white guys trying to
fathom truth in sex. That same old boys' club, once again slouching
toward C-Span to instruct America on the perils of sex in the
federal workplace.
</P>
<P>
   And who could believe that all these years later, Strom Thurmond
would still be center stage and Tang-colored? If Thurmond, who was
a boyish 88 during the Thomas-Hill hearings, and Ted Kennedy and
Joe Biden were uncomfortable with Long Dong Silver and X-rated
videos, imagine how they'll handle presidential phone sex and thong
underwear.
</P>
<P>
   We will have to do simultaneous translations with Thurmond
again, like the one the columnist Dave Barry did during the last
Senate sex seminar:
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thurmond: Deah wheah etn lonsh yep?
</P>
<P>
   Translator: He says, ``Did we eat lunch yet?''
</P>
<P>
   What a tableau. Henry Hyde lumbering across the marbled halls
from the House to the Senate, allegedly more in sorrow than in
anger, leading that pack of gray-haired, gray-faced, gray-suited
and gray-spirited fogies. These self-appointed Torquemadas of the
birds and the bees looked more like gouty Florida retirees hurrying
to get to that early-bird buffet.
</P>
<P>
   But the House managers were spring chickens compared with the
greeting party in the Senate, composed of Thurmond, 96, Sen. Robert
Byrd, 81, and Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 74, whose idea of a
wicked judicial jest is emblazoning his black robes with gold
Gilbert and Sullivan chevrons.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Mel Brooks routine. The Cicero-loving Bob Byrd, or
Quintus Robertus Byrdus, and his conclave of 2,000-year-old men
orating about those headlines in The Roman Tribune _ ``Ovid Ousted,
Augustus Disgusted.'' These are the sexual arbiters who are charged
with the solemn task of deposing the frisky Monica Lewinsky and
deciding who touched whom, where, when and with what degree of
arousal?
</P>
<P>
   Great Caesar's ghost!
</P>
<P>
   Last time it was a feminist liberal lynch mob trying to kill off
a conservative Supreme Court nominee over sex when the real reason
they wanted to get rid of him was politics.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's a reactionary lynch mob trying to kill off a
Democratic president over sex when the real reason they want to get
rid of him is politics.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the impeachment trial begin, it's hard to believe the
Senate, even with its sprinkling of post-Anita women, is any better
equipped to find justice in this politically poisoned muck than it
was the last time around.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that they Just Don't Get It. Maybe they should just
keep their noses out of it.
</P>

SPORTS COLUMN: BRIBING MILLIONAIRE DELEGATES, AND A FEW OTHER
IDIOCIES  (JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the National Basketball Association has solved the
perplexing problem of how to share a few billion dollars, it dawns
on me that there are many more unresolved idiocies out there in the
sporting world just waiting to be attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one idiocy I'd like to cut off at the pass: the fervent
American participation in bribing millionaires. Apparently, the
Salt Lake City Olympic people have been passing out money, college
tuition, elective surgery and who-knows-what condos and other
goodies up in nouveau ski-chalet country, in return for a few
little favors from some (or maybe many) International Olympic
Committee delegates.
</P>
<P>
   These delegates, who choose Olympic sites every two years, are
already well-heeled and well-positioned in their home countries,
and the IOC effectively licenses them to roam the world with
gunnysacks, playing one bidding city against another.
</P>
<P>
   This stuff may go on in the rest of the world, but it is a
dreadful practice for America, and I'll tell you why. Nobody is
more sanctimonious about ``our way of life'' than Americans. We
like to say we are the most moral, righteous folk on the planet,
but we don't necessarily act that way when it is against our self
interests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While roaming the dreary streets of downtown Atlanta in the
fetid summer of 1996, I kept muttering, ``What were the delegates
thinking when they overlooked Toronto and Melbourne?'' (The
delegates themselves were holed up in exclusive hotels, whisked to
events in air-conditioned limousines.)
</P>
<P>
   I now have to wonder if every time I complained to an Olympic
official about the squalid T-Shirt Shack Games, I was talking to
somebody who had taken a few favors from the Atlanta organizing
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Until further notice, I will feel the same way about the
legitimacy of Salt Lake City as the host of the 2002 Winter Games.
There was a mandatory first step Friday with the much-too-belated
resignation of Frank Joklik, the chairman of the organizing
committee, and some of his top officials, but the taint of the
sleaze will not vanish by 2002. All future American bidding cities
must take an oath not to grease IOC delegates and similarly suspect
characters.
</P>
<P>
   You have to nip bad ideas in the bud, before they become a
habit, like the designated-hitter rule. If only more people had
screamed, ``That's not baseball!'' we would not have had a quarter
of a century of lumbering retreads and endless games and an entire
American League without a shred of strategy. But we let it go, and
it festers still.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of rampant idiocies, this one in the real world,
is the ghastly increase in vehicles careering around corners with
drivers barely in control, gabbing animatedly into a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   It never would have come to this if only a police officer had
pulled somebody over and said, ``See here, sir, you can't drive
with a headset on, or a dog in your lap, so you surely cannot drive
talking into a cell phone. Hold out your wrists, I'm cuffing you
and taking you down to the station.'' But it didn't happen that
way, so we all have to cringe when conversational drivers are on
the loose.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a home-grown North American idiocy: the continued
separation of baseball umpires between National and American
leagues, producing different strike zones, different techniques,
different attitudes. Baseball was going to blend the two sets of
umpires _ as in every other major sport _ but baseball, once again,
has been divided and conquered by Richie Phillips, the head of the
umpires' union. I'm sure the new commissioner will jump right on
this when he takes over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My last idiocy for today concerns the greatest sports event in
the world, the World Cup of soccer. Because it is held only once
every four years, the World Cup induces billions of fans to say
``Back in Mexico in 1970'' or ``back in Italy in 1990,'' with a
sense of history and awe.
</P>
<P>
   Now, somebody wants to dilute, diminish, reduce, cheapen the
World Cup by holding it every two years. The scary thing is that
the threat to the World Cup is none other than Joseph (Sepp)
Blatter, the new secretary general of the world soccer body known
as FIFA.
</P>
<P>
   Blatter seems to forget that players spend a good deal of the
four years preparing and qualifying for the World Cup, and that
fans build up their emotions from year to year. A World Cup game is
staggeringly vital because there is not only no tomorrow, there is
also no next year.
</P>
<P>
   What really worries me about Blatter's blather is that the same
international types who run the IOC also run FIFA, and that there
is money to be made from inspection trips, from television and
construction and licensing, and that World Cups are greased by
presents from hopeful countries. The largesse from Japan and South
Korea, that led to a highly shaky partnership in 2002, has become
legendary. Sepp Blatter should be far too worldly to want to be
connected to a biennial swarm to the global trough.
</P>
<P>
   This is surely just the first in a regular series exposing
idiocies, in and out of sports. We haven't even addressed obnoxious
cell-phone users on commuter trains, or four-hour college football
games, have we?

SPORTS COLUMN: WILL THE JETS' WIZARDS TRAP THE JAGUARS?  (JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their reputation precedes them, even when they are about to
propose the Jets' defensive game plan for Bill Parcells' approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' the Jets' coach has been known to greet them, ``what
have you wizards come up with this week?''
</P>
<P>
   The ordained Wizards are Bill Belichick (assistant head coach
and defensive secondary coach), Al Groh (linebackers coach) and
Romeo Crennel (defensive line coach). They are the Wizards of
Defense whose sorcery will be tested Sunday in the Jets' divisional
playoff game with the Jacksonville Jaguars in the expected wintry
wind chill of Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't like something, I'll say we've got to fix this and
they see the problem,'' Parcells said. ``But they'll also tell me,
`Don't make a mountain out of a molehill,' which I can do
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   During the season, the Wizards' defensive designs contributed to
the Jets' limiting opponents to only 266 points, second in the
National Football League to the Miami Dolphins' 265. But in the
Super Bowl playoffs, when the stakes are higher and opposing
offenses are higher octane, determined defense is even more
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have not been in the playoffs since 1991, but two years
ago the Wizards, then on Parcells' staff in New England (after also
being on his Giants staff), were there when the Patriots stopped
the Jaguars, &QC; 20-6, in the American Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   So the Wizards have not only had two weeks to build a trap for
the Jaguars; they also remember how that title game turned on New
England safety Willie Clay's end-zone interception of Mark
Brunell's pass for what would have been the tying touchdown. Otis
Smith, then a Patriot cornerback, soon returned a fumble 47 yards
for the clinching touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is now the Jets' right cornerback, and with Aaron Glenn
apparently not completely recovered from a sprained ankle, Ray
Mickens is expected to start at left cornerback. Smith and Mickens
will be primarily responsible for covering the left-handed
Brunell's favorite targets, the wide receivers Jimmy Smith and
Keenan McCardell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches do a great job of breaking things down and
translating it to the players,'' Otis Smith said. ``They use the
right players for every situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not being able to use Glenn, their Pro Bowl cornerback, in every
situation would test the Wizards' ingenuity in devising the Jets'
pass coverage. But remember that Glenn, who missed the second half
of the victory over Seattle, was not available at all when the Jets
swept their last three games against Miami, Buffalo and New
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belichick understands everything that goes on _ secondary,
linebackers, line,'' Glenn said. ``He puts his players where they
can make plays _ Mo Lewis rushing, Ray Mickens in the slot. He
taught me how to play zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The colder the weather, the stiffer Brunell's healing ankle
might be, especially on artificial turf. But with the rookie Fred
Taylor, who rushed for 1,223 yards and scored 17 touchdowns, the
Jaguars have a more explosive running attack than that of two years
ago, when the Wizards' game plan controlled Natrone Means and James
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot will depend on how the coaches intend to play the
game,'' Parcells said. ``I can't tell until I see what kind of day
it is _ warm or cold, windy or no wind. How to generate the offense
if you couldn't do the entire scope effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was talking about the Jets' offense, but the weather
will also dictate how Tom Coughlin, the Jaguar coach, will use his
offense and, in turn, it will dictate the Jets' defensive strategy.
Whatever develops, the Jets' defenders know that the Wizards will
be able to adjust to what's happening. Especially in the final
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know each other so well, they can read each other's
minds,'' defensive end Rick Lyle said. ``They're at their best at
the end of a close game. They know the other team's plays and
formations so well and they're able to communicate it to you so
well on the sidelines. You can anticipate what the other team is
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   During the game, Belichick and Crennel are on the sideline.
Groh, the linebackers' guru, is in the coaches' booth on the
press-box level.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no game where we're not prepared,'' linebacker Chad
Cascadden said. ``The coaches always have a wrinkle in the game
plan, and they're able to adjust during the game. And they know how
to coach techniques. In pro football, there's more speed, more
formations than in college, but they know how to fine tune you to
that level.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Wizards' work is never done. If their defense makes the
difference for the Jets Sunday, they will need to be Wizards again
next Sunday in the AFC championship game.

<P>
   During the National Basketball Association's long labor dispute,
Steve Jacobs of Timeout Magazine would listen in on news media
conference calls as league officials gave their latest updates on
negotiations. Brad Jones of Basketball Today listened in when the
union and its players had their telephone talks with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one catch: the names and affiliations were fakes,
and the people listening in were actually spies for each side
monitoring the other side's public posturing.
</P>
<P>
   But the mutual exercise in suspicion and duplicity was, in fact,
only one remarkable, if slightly comic, measure of how relations
between the NBA's players and owners had deteriorated over the six
months of the owners' lockout, a standoff that ended only last
Wednesday with an 11th-hour deal that narrowly averted the first
cancellation of an entire professional sports season.
</P>
<P>
   The level of mistrust and animosity that colored the ugly fight
over how to split $2 billion in annual revenues left many people,
from fans to labor experts to marketing executives, deeply puzzled:
how could the NBA, the league that fused pop culture, entertainment
and sports into an enormously popular commercial product, allow
itself to come apart so destructively?
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, say players, agents and league officials, the
nastiness of the contract battle was not all that surprising. The
league and its players had for years harbored an expanding set of
resentments: there were differences over the power of player agents
and the enormous contracts they were extracting from owners; there
was a hardening of feelings over player misconduct off the court;
and players sensed that however highly they were paid, the owners
had abused them in past labor negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prided ourselves on being the best,'' said Isiah Thomas,
the former star for the Detroit Pistons, who was once the president
of the players union and who is now a television analyst for NBC.
``That's what this league has been about. That's what they fell in
love with. There was a family atmosphere, a real partnership. But
then somewhere along the way, teams and players stopped policing
themselves. It became a leaderless league. That's why we are where
we are today.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, in the aftermath of last week's settlement, and with the
start of an abbreviated season less than four weeks off, the league
and its players have been left to calculate the lockout's damage _
to their own relationships and to the league's relationship with
its fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of ill will that these negotiations have produced
will take a long time to heal,'' said David Falk, the agent for
Michael Jordan and many of the league's biggest stars. ``They've
devalued their own product.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Glass, another agent, said early last week: ``The NBA is
no longer fantastic. The animosity that the players and owners feel
for each other right now insures that. They probably haven't lost
the fans as much as they've killed their own relationship. They'll
never work together again like they once did. The residue of the
last six months will be there for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   David Stern, the NBA commissioner and lead negotiator for the
owners, conceded shortly before the settlement that there was major
repair work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoyed our relationship with the players; we understood
the partnership,'' Stern said. ``Somewhere along the way, I guess
we've lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   How the two sides, once partners, became antagonists is a story
that extends well back beyond the last six months of hard
bargaining, angry rhetoric and public posturing.
</P>
<P>
   The story involves the league's evolution from a troubled sports
enterprise into a superstar-driven, relentlessly marketed
entertainment product, one in which players, promoted by the league
and signed to lucrative endorsement deals, came to have great
individual power. It involves the changing roster of owners, a
shift that saw family-owned teams taken over by maverick
businessmen and giant corporations. It involves the signing of
several calamitous contracts and a range of episodes, minor and
major, in which players and owners each felt betrayed or powerless.
</P>
<P>
   But players and agents and owners, however happy they are to be
playing games again, recognize that the root causes of the dispute
may not go away, and may, in fact, have been exacerbated by the
lockout and the shared loss of hundreds of millions of dollars over
the past six months.
</P>

<P>
   BETRAYAL, ROLLOVERS AND A HIRED GUN
</P>
<P>
   Two events in recent years did much to strain the sense of trust
between players and owners, events that prompted the union to hire
a tough leader for this latest set of negotiations and that
poisoned the atmosphere of those negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the botched contract negotiation in 1995 when
Simon Gourdine, the union's leader, who was himself a former league
official, negotiated a deal with the owners that the players came
to regard as so bad it was an act of betrayal. The second happened
in 1991, when the players came to believe that the owners had in
effect been hiding some of their income during discussions about
sharing revenues with players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you and I have a business, and I don't show you the
paperwork, and I just tell you the money is where it should be,
what would you say?'' Dikembe Mutombo, a player on the union's
negotiating committee, said in recalling the 1991 incident. ``You
don't show money, that's some deep stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in subsequent years, with the players using the same
accounting firm to check on owners' total earnings, many players
believed that the owners had a way of concealing ancillary income
that would not be included in the pot to be divided with the
players. That suspicion was even deeper when the players, in the
course of the latest negotiations, were told by the owners that
many clubs were losing money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a number of months, maybe still even now, for the
players to believe we weren't hiding money, and that the owners
were losing money,'' one Eastern Conference team executive,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said just before the
settlement. ``Most of the players who will vote still believe the
owners are cooking the books, that the teams are not having the
kind of losses that they have reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players have looked at our books and they don't believe
our numbers. There's been an air of mistrust from the beginning
regarding the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the dispute over hiding income generated mistrust, the
contract negotiations in 1995 prompted outright fury. Then,
Gourdine held secret negotiations with Stern on a new deal, and the
proposal that came out included items that were anathema to the
players and their agents, chiefly a luxury tax on contracts that
free agents could sign to stay with their own team.
</P>
<P>
   The players revolted, and certain agents led a movement to
disband the union and then re-create it with different leadership.
Ultimately, Gourdine was ousted, and a much more militant group of
players, including Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning, took
positions of leadership in the union.
</P>
<P>
   The union, determined to assume a far more aggressive and
confrontational approach against owners they felt had both misled
them and then all but tricked them in a contract negotiation, hired
Billy Hunter as its executive director.
</P>
<P>
   When they interviewed Hunter in a San Antonio hotel conference
room in February 1996, few players on the executive committee knew
much about him. They saw on his resume that he was a former U.S.
attorney and knew that he had played two years in the National
Football League as a defensive back and kick returner.
</P>
<P>
   He was a former player. He could relate, they thought. Yet with
no experience as a labor negotiator and approaching his mid-50s,
some skeptical players wanted to know what his objective would be
when he sat across from the powerful commissioner at the bargaining
table.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter vowed that he would try to defeat Stern. ``Just like he
would try to do to me,'' Hunter said. ``I'm not going to be
intimidated, I can tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, in contrast to his predecessor, welcomed the assistance
of prominent player agents, quickly forming an agents advisory
committee. And Hunter was often at Madison Square Garden, working
the locker rooms before the games, spending as much time as he
could talking with players.
</P>
<P>
   Asked often what the players' strategy would be in negotiations,
Hunter would reply, ``We're going to take back what they didn't
give us in 1995.'' He would then conclude, ``I'm relishing the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT MORE THAN SPORT
</P>
<P>
   A savvy 22-year-old named Michael Jordan stood before a crowd of
reporters in 1985 to announce that he had signed an endorsement
deal with Coca-Cola. It was a time when the soft-drink company was
tinkering with tradition by introducing New Coke.
</P>
<P>
   And so the tricky question was asked: ``Michael, do you prefer
New Coke or regular Coke?'' Jordan could either insult tradition or
snub change. He did neither, and told the reporter: ``Coke is Coke.
Both taste great.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate pitchman was born. And from that moment on, Jordan,
with his soft baritone voice and his spellbinding skills on the
court, ignited a marketing phenomenon that would serve the NBA's
strategy to sell its stars.
</P>
<P>
   But in time, the very success of the league's marketing effort _
selling stars more than teams _ created an imbalance of power, with
players able to demand huge salaries and dictate a club's financial
strategy. It also backfired when advertisers, sponsors and fans
came to realize that Jordan and his formidable marketability were
the exception, not the rule.
</P>
<P>
   After the league nearly collapsed during the 1970s and early
'80s, ridden by drug use and by the perception that a predominantly
black league could not sell tickets, Stern was determined to
develop a marketing strategy behind the idea of multimedia stars.
It started with Larry Bird and Magic Johnson _ two likable players
who had ability to match their personality _ and was carried to a
new level by Jordan, a crossover marketing phenomenon able to sign
deals with McDonald's, Nike, Coca-Cola and Gatorade.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's popularity trickled down to the rest of the league.
Suddenly, every team seemed to have a commercially identifiable
face _ Shaquille O'Neal, for instance _ and players rose to
something more closely approximating rock star status. The NBA
became a fixture in a kind of global pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 Olympic Dream Team, festooned with Jordan, Bird and
Johnson, was an international hit. The NBA superstars in Barcelona,
Spain, stopped to take pictures with opposing players and mugged
with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA is much more of a celebrity-driven league than the NFL
or baseball or the NHL,'' said Dean Bonham of the Bonham Group, a
sports marketing firm. ``The word celebrity is used because the NBA
is as much entertainment as it is sport. The NBA has helped
facilitate that exposure through corporations over the years and
have helped foster the image of celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, players, armed with wealth gained outside
their contracts for playing basketball and positioned as the
league's source of identity and appeal, brought enormous strength
to the negotiating table when contract talks came up. Deals for $60
million, then $100 million resulted.
</P>
<P>
   But two contract negotiations changed the economic landscape,
and the mood of the league, more than any others: O'Neal's deal
with the Los Angeles Lakers and Kevin Garnett's with the Minnesota
Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando Magic never imagined it could go from the team of
the next decade as an NBA finalist in 1995 to a team that failed to
make the playoffs last year. But that can happen to a team that
cannot retain its franchise player.
</P>
<P>
   As free agency approached in 1996, the Magic underestimated
O'Neal's market value and insulted him with a $69 million offer.
Rich DeVos, Orlando's owner, vowed he would not break the bank for
O'Neal. The Lakers did, for $121 million. The Magic has not
recovered since, and the leverage of a star player was made
manifest.
</P>
<P>
   Other owners took note. A year later, the new owner of the
Timberwolves, Glen Taylor, watched as his youthful team began to
take form. They were not yet championship material, but with
Garnett, a second-year star, and the rookie Stephon Marbury, the
potential of this previously slumping expansion franchise had the
city and the league buzzing. But when soon faced with losing
Garnett, unproven and just 20 at the time, the Timberwolves signed
him for $126 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Garnett deal certainly opened the eyes of a lot of
owners,'' Tom Gugliotta, Garnett's Minnesota teammate, said
recently. ``If there was any doubt, that was probably the end of
it. The owners felt the guys were abusing the system. Frankly, they
probably were.''
</P>
<P>
   Things may change now.
</P>
<P>
   One team executive said: ``A reasonable person could believe
that the league _ which has made a good deal of money out of
marketing itself through the stars _ might not be so interested in
doing that in the future. We've never marketed a team or league.
We've spent a lot of time marketing our players as role models.
It's not unreasonable to assume that there would be a change in
that position now.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEWER, BOLDER TEAM OWNERS
</P>
<P>
   ``This lockout is about control,'' Karl Malone, the star forward
for the Utah Jazz, said early in the negotiations last summer.
``It's like the owners are saying, `We're going to show you who's
boss.'''
</P>
<P>
   It used to be clear who was in charge. Owners used to be
individuals with a love for the game, like Abe Pollin, who bought
the Washington Wizards 34 years ago and is part of a vanishing
breed of old-line owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more personal in the past,'' said Buck Williams, a
17-year veteran in the league. ``I remember Joe Taub when I was
with the Nets. I think he has just a very small share of that team
now,'' since it was sold to a consortium of real estate developers
last summer, ``but he was someone who was hands on and very
personable. I could always call Joe up and he'd be open and honest
and candid. You could just talk to the guy whenever something was
on your mind. He was a throwback.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, if ever, has Charles Dolan, chairman of Cablevision,
which owns the Knicks, stepped inside the locker room at Madison
Square Garden. In what was more of a family atmosphere in the '60s
and '70s, owners would invite players on vacations with them. Now
there are players who have never met the owners of their teams.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, then, had to represent a tougher, less sentimental
collection of owners, owners who, if they admitted they might have
made mistakes in signing some of the more outrageous contracts with
players, were clearly weary of feeling pushed around. The owners _
Cleveland's Gordon Gund and Ross Perot Jr. of Dallas, for example _
were prepared to fight long and hard for reform of the league's
economics and for regaining what they described as control of their
teams.
</P>
<P>
   For these owners had watched as Anfernee Hardaway in Orlando and
Grant Hill in Detroit played roles in ousting their coaches in an
exercise of power.
</P>
<P>
   And the owners, if they were eager to assert greater control,
were this year uniquely equipped to do so, for 14 months ago the
league had signed four-year television deals that would bring them
a combined $2.64 billion through the 2001-2 season _ more than
double the value of their previous contracts. And the league,
through a fortunate bit of dealing, was assured of being paid even
in the event of a lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is must-have TV,'' Harvey Schiller, president of Turner
Sports, said at the time the deals were announced.
</P>
<P>
   The lucrative deal made sense for NBC and for TNT and TBS, the
Turner stations. They shared nearly $400 million in profits with
the league in the deals that ended last season and expected to
split more in the new contracts.
</P>
<P>
   So it was not surprising that their top executives hardly seemed
pained at the prospect of paying this season's rights fees in full
_ $465 million _ for a truncated or canceled season in exchange for
NBC paying less in the next three seasons and Turner carrying more
future games.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of millions of guaranteed dollars, then, emboldened
the owners and insulated them, at least in part, from catastrophic
losses if a season were lost in an effort to extract the deal they
wanted from the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all about control,'' Falk, the agent many owners
accused of holding teams hostage during contract negotiations, said
near the end of the standoff. ``I don't think this labor dispute is
about economics. I think the owners are sick and tired of young and
basically uneducated men, many of whom haven't finished college, in
a position to demand large sums of money. But I see the
frustration. And yet, at the same time, remember that Stern is the
man who has been saying for the last 20 years that these are the
300 greatest athletes in the world.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Friday, the Senate finally settled on some basic
details for President Clinton's impeachment trial: when procedural
motions are due (Monday), when the prosecution will begin its case
(Thursday) and how long each side will have to present the
now-familiar evidence and arguments (a numbing 24 hours).
</P>
<P>
   But alongside the Senate's crisp, lawyerly schedule is another
timetable: when Clinton will deliver his State of the Union
address.
</P>
<P>
   The speech has long been scheduled, by agreement of the White
House and Congress, for Jan. 19. But already some Republican and
even some Democratic lawmakers have complained about the prospect
of a president extolling the union's state to House members who
impeached him and senators who are mulling his removal from office
on charges mired in Oval Office sex.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton might accommodate a congressional proposal to shift the
address by a few days, his advisers say, but he will not postpone
it indefinitely. To the administration, the speech is a golden
opportunity for Clinton to appear presidential before a national
television audience _ and to challenge his tormentors to improve
affairs of state even as they dicker over the state of his affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The question of when to deliver the speech represents one of
those Washington proxy fights over something bigger. Since Woodrow
Wilson revived the speech describing the State of the Union,
presidents have used it to make an implicit argument before the
upturned faces of their live audience: The three branches of
government may be equal, but one is more equal than others.
</P>
<P>
   Packed into the House chamber, representatives, senators and
justices of the Supreme Court are all listening to him as he
presents his agenda. He does not return the favor, at least not in
such a majestic setting. This year more than ever, some senators
seem uncomfortable with that unbalancing act.
</P>
<P>
   The president will be testing the command of his office,
challenging the widely discussed notion that his impeachment has
weakened the presidency. That is likely to work to Clinton's
advantage, the White House believes. In fact, aides said, the start
of the trial only made it more likely that he will deliver his
speech as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   They view the speech as a critical demonstration that the
government's business continues.
</P>
<P>
   The government's other branches might be reluctant to cheer
Clinton's view of a vibrant, healthy America after a year dominated
by sex talk and perjury charges. But would even the most
obstreperous opponents jeer the president of the United States?
</P>
<P>
   The conservative National Review editorialized last week that
Clinton should speak and that Congress should ``listen
courteously,'' giving the respect due the office. (It added that it
should later dispatch him to private life.)
</P>
<P>
   Along with the majesty of his office, Clinton has his own
political appeal to fall back on. As the president, in the camera's
tight focus, talks about his plans for education and health care,
the viewer is more likely to be impressed with him than with some
unseen member of congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else shows up,'' said a senior Clinton aide, ``but
when you look at it, the president is center stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton does not have to give the speech at all. The
Constitution says nothing about an annual State of the Union
speech. It requires only that the president ``from time to time''
give Congress ``information of the State of the Union'' and policy
recommendations. From Jefferson until Wilson, presidents contented
themselves with annual, written reports.
</P>
<P>
   And an unspoken State of the Union would probably not
irreparably sadden the citizenry or enfeeble the Republic. Franklin
D. Roosevelt enunciated the Four Freedoms in his 1941 address.
Ronald Reagan added the dramatic touch of singling out heroes in
the gallery. But let's face it: There have not been many memorable
State of the Union speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can think of phrases from inaugurals or departure
speeches,'' said Todd Gitlin, professor of culture, journalism and
sociology at New York University. ``Can anyone remember a phrase
from a Reagan State of the Union or a Kennedy one? I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Clinton loves to give this speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the State of the Union is probably Bill Clinton's
favorite day of the year,'' said Paul Begala, the White House
counselor. ``It's the complete coalescence of politics and policy
and communications and one-on-one hand-clasping with members in the
aisles and leading the nation. It's everything.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be little doubt of Clinton's ability to give a
coherent, resolutely high-minded speech that addresses his
predicament obliquely, if at all. Last year, he delivered a smooth
State of the Union Message just six days into the furor over Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   More than other modern presidents, Clinton has used the State of
the Union to annually rewind the mainspring of his administration.
In the months leading up to his address, his top aides meet to plan
the programs he will announce in the speech. Those programs become
the framework for Clinton's entire year.
</P>
<P>
   It was a demonstration of the doggedness of this White House
strategy that meetings to plan the State of the Union were held the
same Saturday last month that Clinton was impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can define a lot of the history of the Clinton presidency
from his State of the Union addresses,'' said William E.
Leuchtenburg, a professor of history at the University of North
Carolina. He argues that Clinton has been given too little credit
on foreign policy and too much for the often small-bore domestic
initiatives that tend to stock his State of the Union messages.
</P>
<P>
   Using the speech to set an agenda is in itself an expansion of
presidential power that has reversed the intended dynamic of the
message. ``It was not an assertion of presidential authority,''
said Garry Wills, adjunct professor of history at Northwestern
University. ``The whole point was that Congress as the boss, the
legislator, is asking the subordinate who executes the laws,
`How're ya doin'?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But now, because of both its content and the surrounding
pageantry, the speech suggests the primacy of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The address also gives Clinton his best annual opportunity to
reach over the heads of Congress to tell Americans of his plans,
which are poll tested for approval. That's why Lyndon Johnson moved
the speech from mid-day to the evening, when the television
audience was larger.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows how Congress will respond? The speech could soften
members toward him. Wilson, in reviving the custom of appearing
before Congress, said he wanted to demonstrate that the president
``is a person'' and a ``human being trying to cooperate with other
human beings in a common service.''

</P>
<P>
   Packed into the House chamber, representatives, senators and
justices of the Supreme Court are all listening to him as he
presents his agenda. He does not return the favor, at least not in
such a majestic setting. This year more than ever, some senators
seem uncomfortable with that unbalancing act.
</P>
<P>
   The president will be testing the command of his office,
challenging the widely discussed notion that his impeachment has
weakened the presidency. That is likely to work to Clinton's
advantage, the White House believes. In fact, aides said, the start
of the trial only made it more likely that he will deliver his
speech as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   They view the speech as a critical demonstration that the
government's business continues.
</P>
<P>
   The government's other branches might be reluctant to cheer
Clinton's view of a vibrant, healthy America after a year dominated
by sex talk and perjury charges. But would even the most
obstreperous opponents jeer the president of the United States?
</P>
<P>
   The conservative National Review editorialized last week that
Clinton should speak and that Congress should ``listen
courteously,'' giving the respect due the office. (It added that it
should later dispatch him to private life.)
</P>
<P>
   Along with the majesty of his office, Clinton has his own
political appeal to fall back on. As the president, in the camera's
tight focus, talks about his plans for education and health care,
the viewer is more likely to be impressed with him than with some
unseen member of congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else shows up,'' said a senior Clinton aide, ``but
when you look at it, the president is center stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton does not have to give the speech at all. The
Constitution says nothing about an annual State of the Union
speech. It requires only that the president ``from time to time''
give Congress ``information of the State of the Union'' and policy
recommendations. From Jefferson until Wilson, presidents contented
themselves with annual, written reports.
</P>
<P>
   And an unspoken State of the Union would probably not
irreparably sadden the citizenry or enfeeble the Republic. Franklin
D. Roosevelt enunciated the Four Freedoms in his 1941 address.
Ronald Reagan added the dramatic touch of singling out heroes in
the gallery. But let's face it: There have not been many memorable
State of the Union speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can think of phrases from inaugurals or departure
speeches,'' said Todd Gitlin, professor of culture, journalism and
sociology at New York University. ``Can anyone remember a phrase
from a Reagan State of the Union or a Kennedy one? I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Clinton loves to give this speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the State of the Union is probably Bill Clinton's
favorite day of the year,'' said Paul Begala, the White House
counselor. ``It's the complete coalescence of politics and policy
and communications and one-on-one hand-clasping with members in the
aisles and leading the nation. It's everything.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be little doubt of Clinton's ability to give a
coherent, resolutely high-minded speech that addresses his
predicament obliquely, if at all. Last year, he delivered a smooth
State of the Union Message just six days into the furor over Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   More than other modern presidents, Clinton has used the State of
the Union to annually rewind the mainspring of his administration.
In the months leading up to his address, his top aides meet to plan
the programs he will announce in the speech. Those programs become
the framework for Clinton's entire year.
</P>
<P>
   It was a demonstration of the doggedness of this White House
strategy that meetings to plan the State of the Union were held the
same Saturday last month that Clinton was impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can define a lot of the history of the Clinton presidency
from his State of the Union addresses,'' said William E.
Leuchtenburg, a professor of history at the University of North
Carolina. He argues that Clinton has been given too little credit
on foreign policy and too much for the often small-bore domestic
initiatives that tend to stock his State of the Union messages.
</P>
<P>
   Using the speech to set an agenda is in itself an expansion of
presidential power that has reversed the intended dynamic of the
message. ``It was not an assertion of presidential authority,''
said Garry Wills, adjunct professor of history at Northwestern
University. ``The whole point was that Congress as the boss, the
legislator, is asking the subordinate who executes the laws,
`How're ya doin'?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But now, because of both its content and the surrounding
pageantry, the speech suggests the primacy of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The address also gives Clinton his best annual opportunity to
reach over the heads of Congress to tell Americans of his plans,
which are poll tested for approval. That's why Lyndon Johnson moved
the speech from mid-day to the evening, when the television
audience was larger.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows how Congress will respond? The speech could soften
members toward him. Wilson, in reviving the custom of appearing
before Congress, said he wanted to demonstrate that the president
``is a person'' and a ``human being trying to cooperate with other
human beings in a common service.''

   WASHINGTON _ ``Be suspicious, the better to escape another's
trickery,'' the Persian maxim goes. Indeed, Iran, with its high
walls, veiled women and mirror-mosaics, is a country that never was
accustomed to revealing its secrets, whether its leader wore a
turban or a crown.
</P>
<P>
   So last week's official admission that a death squad operating
inside its secretive intelligence service was responsible for a
series of killings of the regime's critics was startling, to say
the least.
</P>
<P>
   By American standards, the statement from a spokesman (unnamed)
of the Ministry of Information (as it is called) did not reveal all
that much. It did not identify the ``irresponsible, misguided and
unruly personnel'' who it said had been arrested. It did not say
who ordered the murders. It did not promise a wholesale purge of
the super-secret ministry, which is believed to have carried out
scores of assassinations abroad, sanctioned rogue operations and is
larger and more intrusive in the lives of its own citizenry than
its predecessor, SAVAK, the shah's secret police.
</P>
<P>
   But why, after all, should anyone have expected a full and frank
explanation? Mysterious disappearances, fatal heart attacks in
prison and outright murders have long been part of the political
landscape of Iran's Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, for example, after 134 members of a writers'
association signed a letter calling for an end to censorship in
Iran, five of the signatories were killed or died soon afterward in
suspicious circumstances. The next summer, the driver of a bus
carrying 30 members of the group to a poetry conference in Armenia
twice tried to run the bus off a mountain, both times jumping out
of the bus to save himself first. Both times a passenger grabbed
the wheel and steered the bus back onto the road.
</P>
<P>
   But these incidents were always talked about in hushed tones
around dinner tables, not spread across the front pages of the
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   This time things are different.
</P>
<P>
   The confession of criminality in the heart of the Islamic regime
was made only after the murders had already unleashed a remarkably
open public debate, in which people who suddenly felt more
vulnerable complained of the specter of official terror, and
Islamic purists blamed anti-Islamic elements and outsiders for the
killings. ``American and Israeli spies'' were behind the murders,
the Minister of Information, Ghorban-Ali Dorri-Najafabadi, had
declared.
</P>
<P>
   So the official announcement was something of an answer,
intended to calm the country while still casting suspicion on
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a critical change in the atmosphere had taken place a
year and half ago, when Mohammed Khatami was unexpectedly elected
president, a post in which he shares power with Iran's more
autocratic spiritual guide, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   In the public debate, which can be followed even overseas in
Iranian publications these days, President Khatami has argued that
the goal of the murders was to undermine his campaign to create a
civil society and impose the rule of law in Iran. This amounted to
a public acknowledgment that the country's intelligentsia was at
risk, and it created tremendous public pressure to hold the
government accountable to its people.
</P>
<P>
   Even Khamenei, who has effective authority over the intelligence
and security apparatus, eventually called the murders crimes
``against the country's national security.''
</P>
<P>
   What is unclear, however, is just how much reassurance this
semi-openness has provided for the writers and others who have come
to fear for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   After the Ministry of Information's announcement that it had
uncovered rogues in its ranks, Khatami made it sound as if the
committee had finished its work and the case was closed. ``What
happened in recent days shows that the Ministry of Intelligence is
alert and alive and its strong body has the capability to eradicate
fast and forcefully any sick cell or strange limb that might
appear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of stanching protest and closing the books, the
disclosure elicited calls for more action.
</P>
<P>
   A newly founded party that supports Khatami is calling on the
Government to revamp the entire structure of the intelligence
apparatus, especially its managers. An editorial in Zan, a
newspaper run by Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former President
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, called for the investigatory
committee to look into other mysterious matters, including assaults
against two ministers and violent acts against legal meetings and
newspapers. Others are demanding more openness in the judicial
process, or the resignation of the Information Minister.
</P>
<P>
   But in an address at Friday prayers last week, Ayatollah
Khamenei called for an end to the public debate. ``I am surprised
by what some of our own press is doing,'' he said. ``They are
acting like the enemy, like a foolish child who would ridicule his
father for being in a verbal fight with someone.'' Personally, he
added, ``I can not believe that there was not a foreign scenario or
plot behind the recent murders that harmed this system, the
government and the people.''
</P>
<P>
   And an editorial in the Islamic hardline daily, Qods, blamed the
intelligence agency for talking too much in revealing its
shortcomings, saying, ``The Ministry of Information could have
informed higher officials instead of informing the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as part of a remarkably public debate, that kind of thought
doesn't reassure the intellectuals and dissenters. ``Writers,''
said the novelist Houshang Golshiri in an interview with the daily
newspaper Arya. ``still feel the threat of murder.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE NBA IS ALL ABOUT SPINNING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's going to be tougher now. Rooting for local teams or
resenting individual players is no longer smart enough. Now that
political-style spin has engaged the arena, the National Basketball
Association spectator has to bring to the court an attitude worthy
of the disinfomercials that have emerged since the lockout ended.
``Love that game'' is a peeling bumper sticker.
</P>
<P>
   How will you greet the new season? As a rebirth after a racial
Armageddon, a labor-management fiasco, a triumph of small over
tall, a mockery of working-class values, a brilliant plan to bring
us more quickly to the playoffs? It really doesn't matter what you
choose, so long as you don't just sit there and moan when they
dunk. Find an angle. You'll win with a spin.
</P>
<P>
   Real fans can read the players' collapse in the signs in other
sports. The Jets' surge was credited to Bill Parcells' friendly
fascism; obviously, players need to be manipulated and ordered.
Then there is the widening scandal of the International Olympic
Committee; obviously, the real sport in sport is business, and you
can't beat the bosses at that.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, Yogi Berra finally rolled over for George
Steinbrenner. It was the sensible thing to do. First of all, Yogi
needed publicity for his new museum. More important, as men age,
there are few tighter bonds than those between old enemies. Who
knows you so well, has thought about you as often and as deeply?
Yogi and George, after all, are cartoon figures in the minds of
almost everyone but themselves. Yogi's refusal to set foot in the
Stadium while George was the owner was noble, and still is,
although it became stupid. Nobody cares anymore that Yogi was
crudely fired as Yankee manager. Since then, almost everyone in
America has been crudely fired, in one way or another. Yogi is not
stupid. George came to New Jersey last week. Yogi will go to the
Bronx next season. All will be right with that world.
</P>
<P>
   As one who admired Walt Frazier, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Isiah
Thomas above all others, the sight of Patrick Ewing, clogging the
Knicks' heart and fronting the players' association, was
disheartening. It was too easy for me to believe that he was a
puppet of David Falk, as he was once a puppet of the recently
resigned Georgetown coach, John Thompson. Actually, I do not
necessarily believe this, but I am not privy to accurate basketball
rumors, much less the truth, so I will enjoy the self-interested
takes on this past nonplaying season, including the following:
</P>
<P>
   1. It was just a battle between soft little white guys, David
Stern and David Falk, who couldn't make the varsity cut in high
school. The commissioner who created the modern sport and the super
agent who represented an aging corps of super players went
man-to-man for control of the game. This is an alluring spin for
most fans, who are soft little white guys. No matter which David
won, we won, too.
</P>
<P>
   2. The league won big. By dragging the players back on court
without ceding to their major demands, the NBA stuffed the greed
genie back in the bottle and capped it, giving inspiration to all
the beleaguered conglomerates struggling with ungrateful workers.
Most media outlets, owned by conglomerates and staffed by ingrates,
support this spin.
</P>
<P>
   3. The players really won. By delaying the season, making
reasonable demands (the Smith College economist and players union
consultant, Andrew Zimbalist, was best on this) and showing
themselves as a diverse group, in class, intelligence and financial
need, they transcended the living animated figures marketed by the
NBA and became people. Also, they were the ones who saved the
season.
</P>
<P>
   4. TV won. The length of the regular NBA season and the need to
carry it has always bothered television and advertising (same
thing) executives who have always preferred to cut to the chase,
where the audience and the rates are. Now, a truncated season will
feel as if it has the urgency of playoff time.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. The fans won. The idea of a backlash, that Joe Sixpack,
whoever the suits think that is, will not come back because he is
hurt, disgusted or discovered the Monet exhibit while the Celtics
were dark, is not only silly. It is also enormously pleasing to
Joe, his investment banker and his antique book dealer, because
they think there will be concessions. The game will find new ways
to entertain him, give him free trinkets for showing up, make his
seat warm.
</P>
<P>
   6. The gasbags won. Everyone with access to ink, air time or
cyberspace will have a chance to pontificate at length about the
meaning of all this until it is time to watch games, at which time
we will pontificate on the effect of all this on dunking, before we
go back to our real jobs, which is uncovering the love-that-game
billionaire owner who was raised in a log cabin without cable and
the power forward who manages to keep focus despite five criminal
indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Love that spin.

   Never in the history of modern business has there been a class
of companies that has spiraled so high, so fast and with so little
regard for convention as the Internet companies whose market values
have astonished Wall Street in recent months and caused even more
surprise last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some have shown profits, but many haven't. Some rent space in
office parks or old warehouses. They have relatively few employees,
no manufacturing plants and little inventory.
</P>
<P>
   By almost every traditional way of measuring a company's worth,
they don't add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that we live in a world where Wall Street can't explain
why these stocks are going up and where pundits can't explain why
Clinton is so popular,'' said Mark Pincus, the 32-year-old
president of Tioga Systems, a software company in Palo Alto,
Calif., who sold his Internet company, Freeloader, for $38 million
a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, the old world of building a lot of facilities is
going nowhere,'' Pincus said, ``while the value of doing things
that are idea-based on the Web is going up exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   Under this theory of business, physical assets are liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's atoms you're trying to minimize,'' said Bill Gross, the
president of Idealab, a Pasadena, Calif., company that helps
Internet startups. ``The more neurons you have per dollar the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``zero-gravity'' view of commerce in which ``you don't
want molecules,'' he said. ``Knowledge moves at the speed of light;
molecules move at 600 miles per hour with Fed Ex.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have a less exotic explanation for the
surge in interest in Internet businesses: the potential for
tremendous growth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, there were about 5 million Internet users, but the
number is expected to rise to 115 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for this latest run is growth,'' said Larry
Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential Securities. ``And Wall
Street loves growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com would be a textbook example of the new Internet
businesses, if a textbook existed. It was founded almost four years
ago by Todd Wagner and Mark Cuban, old college friends who were
then in their mid-30s. When it went public last year, it had one of
the fastest opening-day sprints in Wall Street history, rising
nearly 250 percent.
</P>
<P>

   Never in the history of modern business has there been a class
of companies that has spiraled so high, so fast and with so little
regard for convention as the Internet companies whose market values
have astonished Wall Street in recent months and caused even more
surprise last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some have shown profits, but many haven't. Some rent space in
office parks or old warehouses. They have relatively few employees,
no manufacturing plants and little inventory.
</P>
<P>
   By almost every traditional way of measuring a company's worth,
they don't add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that we live in a world where Wall Street can't explain
why these stocks are going up and where pundits can't explain why
Clinton is so popular,'' said Mark Pincus, the 32-year-old
president of Tioga Systems, a software company in Palo Alto,
Calif., who sold his Internet company, Freeloader, for $38 million
a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, the old world of building a lot of facilities is
going nowhere,'' Pincus said, ``while the value of doing things
that are idea-based on the Web is going up exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   Under this theory of business, physical assets are liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's atoms you're trying to minimize,'' said Bill Gross, the
president of Idealab, a Pasadena, Calif., company that helps
Internet startups. ``The more neurons you have per dollar the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``zero-gravity'' view of commerce in which ``you don't
want molecules,'' he said. ``Knowledge moves at the speed of light;
molecules move at 600 miles per hour with Fed Ex.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have a less exotic explanation for the
surge in interest in Internet businesses: the potential for
tremendous growth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, there were about 5 million Internet users, but the
number is expected to rise to 115 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for this latest run is growth,'' said Larry
Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential Securities. ``And Wall
Street loves growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com would be a textbook example of the new Internet
businesses, if a textbook existed. It was founded almost four years
ago by Todd Wagner and Mark Cuban, old college friends who were
then in their mid-30s. When it went public last year, it had one of
the fastest opening-day sprints in Wall Street history, rising
nearly 250 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company broadcasts live speeches, conferences, television
events and even professional wrestling over the Internet. It has
250 employees who work out of an old warehouse in Dallas that it
rents for $4,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, almost inexplicably, shares of Broadcast.com rose 50
percent and the company ended the day with a value of $3.4 billion,
more than the value of Wendy's International, which has 150,000

   WASHINGTON _ It may be the ultimate slap at the boys in suits
who have long dominated U.S. politics: the hottest electoral
commodities, as of last week at least, are best known for the men
they married, and their last tries for elective office were in
student government.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Hanford Dole commanded international attention when
she announced she was resigning as president of the American Red
Cross to ponder going after the Republican presidential nomination
next year. Hillary Rodham Clinton did not announce anything, and
there is no evidence that she will. But that has not tamped down a
persistent buzz in New York political circles _ one stoked happily
by the press _ that she might dive into the Democratic race to
succeed Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The boomlets for Mrs. Dole and Mrs. Clinton, both of whom were
at the top of Gallup Poll's survey of most admired women of 1998
(Mrs. Clinton placed first, followed by Oprah Winfrey and Mrs.
Dole), are surprising. Both women have formidable professional
accomplishments but are nonetheless most famous because of their
husbands. Mrs. Dole even overtook the early favorite, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, in a poll last week of Republican primary voters in
New Hampshire. (That may reflect little more than her name
recognition and the initial excitement over her announcement.)
</P>
<P>
   The enormous interest comes despite _ or maybe because of _ the
fact that their husbands have seen better days: President Clinton
faces an impeachment trial; former Sen. Bob Dole led his party to a
devastating defeat by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But their unusual circumstances have given both women rare
political appeal: While some ambitious, bright women threaten
voters, particularly men, Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Dole ease such
qualms because they are also viewed as loyal, traditional wives.
</P>
<P>
   Besides enduring the cascade of revelations about her husband's
affairs, Mrs. Clinton aggressively defended him. And Mrs. Dole did
for her husband at the 1996 Republican convention what he could not
do for himself: She waded into the audience and tried to rescue his
candidacy by articulating a passionate case for his election.
</P>
<P>
   The positive reaction may be the latest example of voters who _
after the yearlong Lewinsky drama _ have lost confidence in the
political structure and see women as representing different values.
That happened in 1992, when voters elected four women to the Senate
in part out of bitterness over the Clarence Thomas hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women are not Jesse Ventura,'' said Rachel Gorlin, a
Democratic strategist, referring to the professional wrestler who
was elected governor of Minnesota in November. ``They are very
tested. They are very established. But they are kind of a hybrid:
they represent values that are not the traditional back-room guy
chomping the cigar but are not completely outside of the political
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Dole are devout Methodists who are
admired for their devotion to the church. Yet they are also driven,
Ivy League-trained lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both cases, you're talking about women who rose
professionally because of who they were married to,'' said Ralph
Reed, a Republican strategist. ``In Elizabeth's case, when she was
named a Cabinet secretary, it didn't hurt that she was married to a
vice presidential candidate and a powerful senator. But what makes
these women figures of sympathy and desirable on a political level
is the perception that they are better politicians than their
husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mrs. Clinton, at 51, is 11 years younger than Mrs. Dole,
she has forged a more traditional path. She followed Clinton to
Little Rock, where they reared their daughter. By contrast, Mrs.
Dole did not have children and by the time she married late in
life, she was nearly a decade into her climb up the governmental
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole and Mrs. Clinton do not necessarily signal any trend
because they are not ordinary politicians. Although Democrats enjoy
an advantage over Republicans in wooing female voters, women do not
reflexively flock to the polls to vote for women.
</P>
<P>
   For example, former Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, who made history as
the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 1984, did not do
particularly well among Democratic women last year when she lost
her party's nomination for U.S. senator from New York after a
lackluster campaign. And New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, a
Republican, drew fewer votes from women than did her male opponents
in 1997 and 1993. ``Christie Whitman's biggest problem is getting
women to vote for her,'' said Mike Murphy, an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Dole and Mrs. Clinton have emerged as possible
potent antidotes to what ails their parties: Mrs. Clinton had
reignited the fears people have of liberal Democrats by championing
national health care, and because of the perception that she would
be a co-president. But her image as a compassionate figure who was
wronged by her husband has quieted those misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, increasingly, have suffered a reputation as being
dominated by males who are not interested in issues like education
and health care. Mrs. Dole is in a position to neutralize that
perception, and she would stand out in the sea of men seeking the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Yet timing is a factor: Before Ferraro's vice presidential
candidacy, most people probably would not have dared to advance a
Clinton or Dole candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see either Elizabeth Dole or Hillary Clinton springing
out of the head of Zeus,'' said Ruth Mandel, a political scientist
at Rutgers University. ``They emerged out of the last quarter of
the 20th century from a culture which makes it possible for people
to consider women as potential presidential candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that if they began running in earnest, their
prominence might magnify any blunders they make. And they could not
expect to be embraced automatically by women. Referring to Mrs.
Dole's opposition to abortion, Murphy said, ``The pro-choice women
will turn on her.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be why it is far from assured that the names Dole and
Clinton will adorn bumper stickers again. Yet there is no question
that both women are drawn to political power. After starting a book
club in junior high school, Mrs. Dole writes, she took matters into
her own hands: ``I simply declared myself president.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-UNBURDEN (Phnom Penh, Cambodia) _ Countless
`unburdenings' are taking place among Cambodians today as the
country seems to be embarking, spontaneously, on a long-delayed
national conversation about its traumatic past. Interviews with a
score of people here and in Battambang, the country's
second-largest city _ from market vendors to professors _ suggest
that a common legacy of anger and pain is being shared in a way
that has not been evident in recent years. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-U.S. (Havana) _ A high-ranking Cuban official has denounced
President Clinton's proposal to ease some restrictions on the
United States' embargo of this communist-run island, calling them a
``deceptive maneuver'' intended to deflect growing opposition
around the world to the embargo. By James C. McKinley Jr.
</P>
<P>
   KAZAKH-CAPITAL (Astana, Kazakhstan) _ When President Nursultan
Nazarbayev unveiled his plans for this city of 300,000 people on
the Siberian steppe, he stubbornly rejected objections that the
move from the old capital of Almaty was unnecessary, unpopular and,
considering the cost in an oil-rich but still cash-poor nation,
even imprudent. On Sunday, the autocratic Nazarbayev is seeking
re-election to a new seven-year term; he is expected to win easily.
But the prognosis for his dreamchild, Kazakhstan's new capital, is
in doubt. By Steve LeVine.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-AXWORTHY (Toronto) _ As a graduate student at Princeton
University in the 1960s, Lloyd Axworthy spent many nights at the
old Madison Square Garden watching greats like Dave DeBusschere,
Walt Frazier and Bill Bradley outplay almost everyone in the
league. It did not help his studies, Axworthy concedes, but the New
York Knicks' approach to basketball did help him develop a game
plan that has made him the most successful Canadian foreign
minister in years, and also the one who has most antagonized
Washington. By Anthony DePalma.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-ANIMALRIGHTS (Oxford, England) _ Colin Blakemore,
Wayneflete Professor of Physiology at Oxford and director of the
university's Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, spends his days
like any academic, in an office with brimming in-trays and
bookshelves stacked high with research volumes. His work has won
him awards for advances in treating vision problems in infants and
young children. But it has also attracted the attention of a
violence-prone movement that says it wants to kill him because his
research depends on animal testing. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-HOLIDAYS (Moscow) _ In Russia, long holidays are a handy
excuse for not paying salaries for work that is not being done _ a
familiar practice in post-communist Russia even in the nonholiday
season. But there were stores, and offices _ all of them private _
that defied the Christmas holidays, because they could not afford
to stay shut for so long. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-POLITICS (Istanbul, Turkey) _ Turkey may soon have a
functioning government after six weeks without one, but its
new-found assertiveness in foreign policy is likely to continue no
matter who emerges as the next Prime Minister. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w' code)
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-EVIDENCE (Washington) _ The Senate's agreement on how to
conduct the initial phase of President Clinton's impeachment trial
sent House prosecutors and the President's lawyers diving this
weekend back into the voluminous evidence collected by the
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. In the 7,000 pages of grand jury
testimony and boxes of supplementary evidence, Rep. Henry Hyde, the
leader of the House prosecution team, sees a clear and convincing
picture of perjury and obstruction of justice so grave that Clinton
should be removed from office. From that same pile of evidence, the
president's legal team is putting together a more aggressive
defense than the one they presented unsuccessfully to the House _
one they now say should lead to the president's exoneration. The
White House agreed to stipulate to the record amassed by the
independent counsel, although the president's lawyers profoundly
disagree with Starr and Hyde about what the evidence shows. By Jill
Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-HYDE (Washington) _ When Clinton was impeached it was in
no small measure as a result of Rep. Henry Hyde's determination to
press forward even after Republican losses in the November
elections. Hyde is now throwing himself wholeheartedly into his new
role as Clinton's chief prosecutor in the Senate. Rep. David Dreier
of California, one of his closest friends on the Hill, said Hyde's
attitude was: ``If you're going to catch hell no matter what you
do, you might as well do what's right.'' By Melinda Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-DEFENSE (Washington) _ Some now-familiar faces will be
presenting some now-familiar arguments on the Senate floor to
defend President Clinton as he goes on trial this week. Though
White House aides say they are still mapping out their strategy,
the core of the defense team and of its case are settled. The team
is to be led by Charles F.C. Ruff, the former Watergate special
prosecutor who is Clinton's fifth White House counsel. By James
Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO-WINDFALL (Undated) _ As state legislatures nationwide
start new sessions, lawmakers are beginning to debate how to spend
their biggest windfall in recent years: tens of billions of dollars
from tobacco settlement deals. While some elected officials are
calling for the money to be spent on health care initiatives and
anti-smoking campaigns, others are urging that it be used on
projects unrelated to tobacco, including new schools or jails, and
even sidewalk repair. Still other lawmakers say the tobacco
windfall should be used to eliminate state debts or be given to
taxpayers as rebates. By Barry Meier.
</P>
<P>
   TEAMSTERS (Undated) _ Thomas R. O'Donnell, a newly elected vice
president-at-large of the teamsters, is in the infelicitous
position of obtaining the second largest vote total in last month's
union election _ only the new president, James P. Hoffa, received
more _ yet facing possible expulsion from the union. By Steven
Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   PAROLE-DEBATE (Undated) _ Fifteen states so far have taken the
politically popular step of abolishing parole boards, a vestige of
what most Americans regard as a failed system of penal
rehabilitation, and last week Gov. George Pataki of New York
proposed to make his state the 16th. But based on the experience of
the other states, there is no proof that eliminating parole boards
reduces crime, while it can lead to a further increase in the
already swelling prison population, criminologists and other
experts say. By Fox Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   ASTRONOMY-NEWPLANETS (Austin, Texas) _ In a stunning run of
discoveries over the last three years, astronomers have observed 17
nearby stars that appear to be orbited by planets more or less the
size of Jupiter. But while astronomers continue the search for more
such objects, they have now seen enough to be puzzled by an
emerging pattern: None of these extrasolar planetary systems seems
to resemble the Sun's family of planets. Is this an observational
fluke? Or is the solar system a cosmic oddball? By John Noble
Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   DOCS-REBEL (New York) _ While 92 percent of doctors in New York
state accepted managed care last year, it seems a small rebellion
is on. Fed up with years of acrimonious relationships with
managed-care companies, doctors, particularly those serving upper
middle class patients, are quietly starting to fight back. Many are
dropping plans that have the lowest reimbursement rates, biggest
administrative headaches or represent the fewest number of their
patients. Others are washing their hands of the carriers, forcing
patients to pay up front and file claims the old-fashioned way, or
pay the fees themselves. By Jennifer Steinhauer.

   Psychotherapy or pills? For years, mental health professionals
have differed over how best to treat people with disorders listed
in the current edition of the American Psychiatric Association's
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.
</P>
<P>
   In the pet world, some veterinarians have found a niche treating
behavioral problems that can drive pet-owners, well, crazy. But
except for the occasional tranquilizer, animal mental-health
specialists have mostly employed a kind of psychotherapy _ behavior
modification _ to help pets deal with anxiety, rage, depression and
other problems that some veterinarians say affect animals as well
as humans.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, the Food and Drug Administration approved
two drugs commonly prescribed for human depressive and
nervous-system disorders as medications for dog mental-health
problems like separation anxiety (which causes some pooches to tear
up the furniture when their owners go out) and old dog syndrome
(which leads dogs to forget important things, like having been
housebroken).
</P>
<P>
   Given the money to be made on Americans' twin obsessions with
psychological advice and pets, it's only a matter of time before a
flood of books, television shows, radio programs and newspaper
columns feature pop psychiatrists whose specialty is putting Rover
on the couch or on Prozac. Here's how one column might look:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Petshrink:
</P>
<P>
   My once playful, affectionate cat, Miss Whispers, has suddenly
stopped responding to me. She won't come to eat when I call her,
and refuses to play with her little toys or demonstrate affection.
All she does is lie on the couch. Please, would psychotherapy or
drugs help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Heartbroken in Hackensack
</P>
<P>
   Dear Heartbroken:
</P>
<P>
   Mental-healthwise, cats are tough nuts to crack. Perhaps Miss
Whispers is suffering from Oppositional Defiant Disorder, one
symptom of which the DSM lists thusly: ``Often actively defies or
refuses to comply with adult's requests or rules.'' You might
consider counseling, psychotropic medication and involuntary
commitment in a secure but cheerful facility.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Petshrink:
</P>
<P>
   I recently went horseback riding for the first _ and last _
time. Obviously hoping to encourage other riders to ridicule me
behind my back, the stable manager put me on a bloated mare that
stopped abruptly every 30 feet or so, jerking its head down to
gorge itself on huge mouthfuls of grass, leaves and other debris.
The horse also chewed the tip of my sneaker. What's ailing her?
</P>
<P>
   _ Recovering in Rochester
</P>
<P>
   Dear Recovering:
</P>
<P>
   What I'm hearing here is a classic case of Binge Eating
Disorder, which the DSM says is characterized by ``eating, in a
discrete period of time, an amount of food that is definitely
larger than most people would eat in a similar period.''
</P>
<P>
   This disorder responds well to group therapy, but horses are
notoriously judgmental, and it may be that she just hated you.
</P>
<P>
   Hey Petshrink:
</P>
<P>
   I got 40 acres here in God's country, and a couple of months ago
I caught my Rotweiler, Lt. Colonel Himmler, whimpering out by the
gun shed, where it had been chased by a chicken. This is the very
same dog I once seen chew the hind leg off a billy goat.
</P>
<P>
   Now the dog cries all the time, don't eat, and won't even growl
at the mailman, a uniformed federal employee. What should I do?
This is important. I'm going to be needing a combat-ready canine
come Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   _ Igor from Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Igor,
</P>
<P>
   Your dog may have a a combination of Dysthymic Disorder, (``low
self-esteem'' and ``feelings of hopelessness'') and Dissociative
Fugue (``confusion about personal identity'' and ``inability to
recall one's past''). Please do not contact me again.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Petshrink:
</P>
<P>
   My once well-behaved pet monkey, Moonshine, has begun to scream
hysterically 24 hours a day. He demands constant attention and
praise and is always showing off. When I have people over he makes
a disgusting spectacle of himself with lewd behavior, if you know
what I mean. Is psychiatric intervention called for?
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael from Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Michael:
</P>
<P>
   Well, as the man on the radio used to say, Monkeys is the
cwaaaziest people. We're probably talking Hypomanic Episode
(``inflated self-esteem or grandiosity'' and an increase in
``psychomotor agitation''). There also may be a concurrent onset of
Exhibitionism, ``behaviors involving the exposure of one's genitals
to an unsuspecting stranger.'' Group therapy sometimes works, but
seldom with monkeys, as you can't get them to pay attention.
Electroshock is an option, though he won't be as frisky afterward.

HEAVYWEIGHTS OF WOMEN'S COLLEGE BASKETBALL SQUARE OFF  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CAVANAUGH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To provide his starters with tougher competition, Geno Auriemma,
the women's coach at Connecticut, sent two assistants in search of
male practice players on the Storrs campus a few years ago. But
with 11 players capable of starting for most teams in the Big East,
Auriemma must no longer find men to practice against his front
liners.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several players on the top-ranked and undefeated UConn
women's team, which meets No. 2 Tennessee in a showdown at Gampel
Pavilion Sunday afternoon, have said their toughest competition to
date has come from one another during practice sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Through its first 13 games, Connecticut has surpassed 100 points
nine times while beating its opponents by an average of 40 points.
``We do score pretty easily at times,'' Auriemma said after the
Huskies trounced Pittsburgh, 106-52, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They are unlikely to score so easily against Tennessee, which
has lost only once in 13 games _ to Purdue on Nov. 15 _ and has won
three consecutive national championships.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols have also won three of their last four games
against UConn, including a 15-point victory last January before a
crowd of 24,597 in Knoxville. Tennessee also knocked off the
Huskies in both the 1996 Final Four and the 1997 Midwest Regionals.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tennessee has lost both times it has played in
Connecticut _ at Storrs in 1995 and at Hartford in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to downplay the significance of Sunday's game, Auriemma
said: ``I realize that for a lot of people the world will come to
an end around 7 o'clock Sunday night when we will either have won
the national championship or wrapped up second place. It's like the
season ends on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   It will not, of course, but the game could be a portent for this
season's Final Four. The outcome, no doubt, will instill confidence
in the victor and a certain doubt in the loser.
</P>
<P>
   UConn's depth could be decisive Sunday. Eight players are
averaging at least 17 minutes of play, including the sophomore Shea
Ralph, who has averaged 22 minutes though she has not started a
game since returning from a knee injury that caused her to miss all
of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Her playing time is second only to Amy Duran, the team captain
and lone senior on the starting five, who has played 23 minutes a
game. Reflecting the Huskies' balance, five players are averaging
in double figures _ Abrosimova (17.5 points), Ralph (16.7), and
three freshmen, Tamika Williams (12.4), Swin Cash (12) and Asjha
Jones (10.2). Cash, who is coming back from a stress fracture in
her right foot that kept her out of two games and limited her to
only seven minutes in the most recent game, is expected to see
significant playing time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee counters Connecticut's depth with its three ``Meeks''
_ the incomparable senior Chamique Holdsclaw from Queens, N.Y., and
the sophomores Tamika Catchings and Semeka Randall. They each were
chosen as preseason all-Americans and they average 20, 15 and 13
points, respectively.

<P>
   They have a weighty title _ anchor _ but an evanescent legacy.
Their faces are etched into the public eye by weightless electrons
30 times a second, but after 1,800 seconds, the music swells, the
screen changes to ``Jeopardy'' and they are gone until the next
evening, the next bulletin, the next interruption of that regularly
scheduled program.
</P>
<P>
   But where there is ink, there is permanence, and it is not
difficult to understand why the nation's television news anchors
are increasingly drawn across the boundary between media to the
solid ground of books on paper. Both Tom Brokaw of NBC and Peter
Jennings of ABC have books on the best-seller list (in fact, they
are currently numbers 1 and 2, respectively, on The New York Times
nonfiction list), and Dan Rather of CBS, who has written or edited
five books, has two more scheduled to come out in the next year or
so.
</P>
<P>
   The anchors are not shy about acknowledging their envy for the
one comfort of writers everywhere: the constancy of the written
word, the lasting victory of the printed page over videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always frustrated by the abbreviated form we have,''
said Brokaw, author of ``The Greatest Generation'' (Random House),
a 352-page account of the World War II years. ``You spend a day on
a distinguished piece of work, and as the joke goes, it all goes
out to Venus at the end of the day. But after the book came out, I
had dinner with Jim Lehrer, who said to me, `Brokaw, you know, your
great-grandchildren won't see you on TV, but they'll read this
book.' '' (Lehrer, of the PBS NewsHour, has written 11 books.)
</P>
<P>
   Most older television journalists got their start in print and
never really lost the sense that it is first among equals as a
communications medium, the classic sense of pencil envy that
Jennings says is rapidly disappearing among younger workers who
came straight to video, as he did. Rather unabashedly admits that
over a late-night glass of wine, there is nothing quite so
satisfying as seeing one's name on the spine of a hard-cover book
on a well-populated shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound corny, but I like the writer's life, the way a
book looks and feels,'' he said. ``When you're thinking about your
life's dreams and trying to get past the ephemeral, writing a book
provides a unique satisfaction.'' Rather is completing a collection
of essays, ``Deadlines and Datelines,'' for publication by Morrow
this spring, and is working on a documentary film for PBS about his
native Texas that will also be spun off into a book.
</P>
<P>
   But even beyond the physical pleasure and vague sense of
immortality, there is also a sense that books confer a legitimacy
on a profession often derided for its absence of seriousness. ``All
these guys think of themselves primarily as journalists, and they
want to be recognized as more than just television personalities,''
said Peter Osnos, the publisher of Public Affairs books, who has
helped transform Sam Donaldson, Morley Safer, Ted Koppel and others
into authors. ``They don't need to cash in, but they like having
people acknowledge them as writers.''
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why their topics are so sweeping: centuries,
generations, epochs instead of the seconds usually used to measure
their work. Even Rather edited a book on the early years of the
20th Century.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings' book, written with Todd Brewster, was called ``The
Century'' (Doubleday). ``It was hard, because I'm used to writing
for sound,'' Jennings said. ``But the material was so broad it was
inescapable. The calendar told us to do it.''

people acknowledge them as writers.''
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why their topics are so sweeping: centuries,
generations, epochs instead of the seconds usually used to measure
their work. Even Rather edited a book on the early years of the
20th Century.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings' book, written with Todd Brewster, was called ``The
Century'' (Doubleday). ``It was hard, because I'm used to writing
for sound,'' Jennings said. ``But the material was so broad it was
inescapable. The calendar told us to do it.''

   For years, language purists have rent their garments over the
use of the word hopefully to mean ``I hope,'' as in, ``Hopefully,
that will never happen again.'' Such use, they assert, arose in the
rule-smashing 1960s. For many, it was and remains a sign of the
decline of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes Fred Shapiro, associate librarian at Yale Law
School, using a powerful new computer tool called JSTOR that
permits detailed searches of thousands of issues of scholarly
journals back to the 19th century. And, lo and behold, the use in
formal English of hopefully to modify a whole sentence goes back
easily to the 1930s. He has found dozens of examples before 1960,
including an 1851 citation that starts, ``Hopefully, not to say,
certainly, in that time . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro's findings will appear in a forthcoming issue of the
journal ``American Speech.'' He has also uncovered a 1912 use of
``double standard'' referring to the gap between the treatment of
men and women 39 years before the Oxford English Dictionary's first
citation of it; a 1931 example of ``Native American'' for American
Indian, 43 years ahead of Oxford's first example, and a 1914 use of
``solar energy,'' 58 years earlier than any other known use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of language is being rewritten because of these
electronic tools,'' said Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   JSTOR, which is a nonprofit project to put online forgotten and
inaccessible scholarly journals, is likely to cause a great deal of
intellectual history to be revised. For the first time, biologists,
economists and mathematicians can trace the development of a
question over the last century.
</P>
<P>
   And as they do their research, they are discovering not only new
facts but something else: humility. Many new ideas are just old,
forgotten ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mathematics has a long shelf life and there are important
ideas to be picked up from papers of 100 years ago,'' said Cathleen
Synge Morawetz, a professor emerita of mathematics at New York
University and a recent winner of the National Medal of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Morawetz said an intriguing possibility is that
forgotten computational problems abandoned decades ago because the
technology was unavailable can now be solved. ``This opens up huge
possibilities as people get used to the idea of accessing old
journals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   JSTOR, an acronym for ``journal storage,'' is the creation of
William Bowen, president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Bowen,
a former president of Princeton University, thought of the idea
after a 1992 board meeting at Denison University in Ohio, where he
is a trustee and alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting it was announced that the university wanted to
build a new library wing. When Bowen asked what was taking up so
much shelf space, it turned out to be mostly back copies of
scholarly journals. He suggested looking into ways to digitalize
them.
</P>
<P>
   Denison never got its library wing, but the world got JSTOR.
</P>
<P>
   The Mellon Foundation has put up about $5 million for JSTOR,
which has been in operation for more than a year. The computer data
base contains many of the issues of 67 scholarly journals in a wide
range of fields _ from mathematics to the social sciences. All back
issues of 100 journals are expected to be online by the end of this
year. JSTOR clients are mostly American university libraries, and
it is starting to sign up subscribers overseas. So far,
subscriptions are unavailable for individuals and commercial
enterprises, but the hope is to make JSTOR self-sufficient. The Web
site is www.jstor.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, people asked what the point of it all is since
nobody ever searches for 30-year-old articles,'' recalled Kevin
Guthrie, president of JSTOR, which is based in New York City. ``But
it turned out that nobody was using older literature because it was
impossible to get to and search. You had to stumble on something or
it had to be cited by someone else. Now you can ask a question and
search through the journals.''
</P>
<P>
   Juliana Mulroy, professor of biology at Denison, said she has
used the search tool to trace cross-disciplinary views of the Dust
Bowl that were a precursor to the current debate over global
warming. In the past, such research would have been enormously
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   What has struck Professor Mulroy is the way JSTOR will change
the class boundaries within academia. ``I don't have to be at
Harvard or Berkeley to have access to a first-class library
anymore,'' she said. ``I can do this research sitting in my
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowen said he has been excited to hear from small colleges in
the Appalachian mountains and from housebound scholars using JSTOR.
</P>
<P>
   Some uses for the new files have been unexpected, Guthrie says.
The William and Mary Quarterly was expected to yield little from
its turn-of-the-century volumes, which were not research oriented
at the time. But those issues are filled with family names and
rosters of families' comings and goings in the early colonial
period, and genealogists have found them a rich vein.
</P>
<P>
   Linguists say digital libraries like JSTOR will reduce
dependence on searching through libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have people sitting around reading early books,''
said John Simpson, chief editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.
``But digital data bases like JSTOR are doing a lot to fill in the
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Informed of the new findings on ``hopefully,'' Sol Steinmetz,
former editorial director of the Random House Reference and
Information Division, said he was delighted. ``Even though there
are plenty of sentence adverbs, like frankly,'' he said, ``for some
reason people grabbed onto hopefully and wouldn't accept it. It's a
lot of nonsense. I'm sure people will be very surprised by what is
turning up. I consider it a pleasant shock.''

CARDINALS HOPING TO CONTAIN VIKINGS' RECEIVERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a big secret: which of the Vikings' dangerous wide
receivers will be covered by one of the best cornerbacks in
football, Aeneas Williams, when the Arizona Cardinals play the
Vikings at Minnesota in Sunday's divisional playoff game?
</P>
<P>
   Williams is mum. ``I didn't talk about what we were going to do
against the Cowboys from a secondary standpoint,'' Williams said.
``All I know is we will be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave McGinnis, the Cardinals' defensive coordinator, gives
nothing up. ``We're going to have 11 players on the field,'' he
said, contradicting the popular notion that an opponent needs 12
players to slow the Minnesota offense.
</P>
<P>
   Football sometimes is one big chess game, and the Cardinals do
not want to give the Vikings any advantage by forecasting their
defensive game plan. If Minnesota knew which Arizona defensive back
was going to cover which Viking receiver, then Minnesota would have
an edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have one of the most explosive groups of receivers
in football, and one could argue that it may be one of the best
groups ever, since the Vikings set the National Football League
single-season scoring record with 556 points. Minnesota passed for
41 touchdowns this season, with quarterback Randall Cunningham
throwing to targets like the rookie of the year, Randy Moss; a
future Hall of Famer, Cris Carter; the dangerous Jake Reed,
returning from a back injury, and a rising star, Matthew Hatchette.
</P>
<P>
   So that's the problem the Cardinals face. The Vikings have so
many weapons, how does a defense cover them all?
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're going to do is what we've done all year _ try to
create mismatches,'' Minnesota Coach Dennis Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Which has been easy to do because Minnesota's wideouts are all
big, strong and fast. Moss is 6 feet 4 inches, Carter and Reed are
6-3 and Hatchette is 6-2. Most of the Arizona defensive backs range
from 5-11 to 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   The key to this game will be Williams, a smart player known for
his intense study habits and great leaping ability.
</P>
<P>
   All season, and for much of his eight-year career, Williams has
covered the opponent's best receiver, everyone from Jerry Rice to
Herman Moore to Carter. Last week in the wild-card game against the
Dallas Cowboys, a 20-7 Cardinals victory, Williams held Michael
Irvin to 4 catches for 32 yards. Williams made his fifth
consecutive Pro Bowl this year and holds the franchise record for
touchdowns off interceptions with six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether Moss would be the acid test for him,''
said Arizona's defensive-backs coach, Larry Marmie. ``Aeneas has
played against a lot of great receivers over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect Williams to lock up on Moss. There is no question that
Williams has spent the week studying him extensively, looking for
any tendencies that could be taken advantage of to slow him.
Williams has probably taken a peek at the hottest game film going
around the league the latter part of this season _ Minnesota's game
against the Washington Redskins on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, the Pro Bowl cornerback Darrell Green _ who is
more than half foot shorter than Moss _ covered Moss all over the
field and made him a nonfactor. Green covered Moss in different way
from most defensive backs. The conventional wisdom is to keep Moss
in front of you; if he gets behind you, the thinking is, he can
outrun almost anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But he could not outrun Green, still one of the 10 fastest
players in the game. When Moss would go deep, Green would stay a
half-step behind him, right near Moss' hip, his inside shoulder
pointed toward Moss. That meant it would take a perfect pass to get
the ball over Green's outstretched hand, and indeed many of the
deep balls thrown to Moss were batted down by Green.
</P>
<P>
   Williams will probably try a similar technique, although he does
not have the flat-out speed Green possesses.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona safety Tommy Bennett said the fact that Moss is new to
the league was a major advantage to the Vikings rookie. ``What
defensive backs look for is tendencies on receivers,'' said
Bennett, ``and people really didn't have tendencies on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they do, but this is the problem the Vikings pose: put so
much effort into stopping Moss, and Minnesota's other weapons will
wreak havoc.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the Cardinals are nervous, it isn't showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll do an assortment of things to try and stop
them,'' said Williams. ``I guess our thinking as a secondary is
that we have to contain these guys.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A tense exchange last week between two liberal
members of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of
Medicare moved the group toward a dramatic agreement. The members
agreed to develop a plan to radically revamp Medicare by giving its
beneficiaries a fixed sum of money to buy private or public
insurance. In short, the use of vouchers _ something liberals have
shunned in education _ might be good for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Vladeck, a former administrator of Medicare, who is a
staunch defender of the basic fee-for-service plan, began the
debate by proposing that Medicare officials get stronger powers to
restrict some medical practices, to negotiate fees and to favor
participation by some physicians over others.
</P>
<P>
   A dissenting member, Stuart Altman, a Brandeis University
professor, argued that Vladeck's proposals might result in
excessive governmental control. He could support them only if
Medicare moved to a system of competing public and private health
plans that would give the beneficiaries attractive ways to opt out
of the traditional government program. .
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck eventually chose Altman's competitive model, which put
him in temporary alliance with at least 10 other commissioners; 11
votes from among the commission's 17 members are needed to forward
a recommendation to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the consensus may be more illusory than real. Much more has
to be agreed on before Vladeck, Altman and other Democratic
appointees will agree on a voucher plan to send to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, primarily a fee-for-service health plan serving about
40 million elderly, pays nearly any bill submitted by any doctor on
behalf of any enrollee. There is little supervision of physician
care. The system excludes prescription drugs and other benefits
routinely provided by private insurance plans but does not hold
down costs. As the baby boomers begin to retire, Medicare costs are
expected to soar to about 5 percent of aggregate income by 2020
from about 2.5 percent today
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to change all that are eight Republican appointees of the
advisory commission along with its chairman, Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. They envision Medicare as a
health care system similar to the one covering federal employees,
who can choose from many insurance plans. Under one version, the
beneficiaries would in effect receive a voucher enabling them to
enroll in either the traditional government plan or in a private
managed-care plan. Each plan would offer an identical package of
core benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The tricky step is assigning a dollar value to the voucher. Many
economists favor plans setting their own premiums. Then the
government would pay a certain amount, say, 75 percent of the cost
of the average plan. The beneficiaries would pay the remaining 25
percent, receiving rebates if they chose inexpensive plans. Under
some versions, the government would provide subsidies for
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   This voucher system _ which proponents call premium support _ is
designed to encourage innovation and to pressure plans to keep
their premiums low. Proponents point out that this plan exposes the
beneficiaries to little risk because it ties the dollar value of
the voucher to the premiums that health plans actually charge in
the market. That way, the voucher will not fall below the amount
that families need to buy the government-mandated benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck and some of the other Democratic appointees disagree.
They are skeptical that private plans will be affordable to
moderate income families or that the government can adequately
supervise the market.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Steelman, a Republican appointee, says that the
commission will have to save enough money to cover the future
deficit in the current program and save more money to pay for any
new benefits that the commission adds. Democratic appointees worry
that the savings cannot be achieved without depriving the
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have so far refused to consider raising taxes to
pay for any new benefits. Ms. Steelman cites the ugly backlash in
1989 after Congress taxed every beneficiary in order to add
benefits that many elderly already received from their former
employers. The uproar forced Congress to repeal the new benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats say the only way to make adequate health
benefits universal is to make them mandatory. Vladeck and Altman
are unlikely to approve a voucher plan that lacks sufficient
revenues for drugs and other essentials and fails to cover
low-income families. They lean toward raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other potential sources of dispute. Should the
commission close some of the future deficit by raising the age of
eligibility? And how will it encourage private plans to cater to
AIDS patients and others requiring expensive care? So what seemed
like an easy consensus last week could quickly break down. The
commission may wind up agreeing only to small-bore fixes that would
keep the program solvent for a few more years. And even if it does
propose a radical overhaul, Congress might not go along.
</P>
<P>
   Yet something of potential importance occurred last week.
Vladeck and other defenders of the current system know they cannot
make traditional Medicare work well unless Congress gives it the
power so long withheld. But, Altman says, the road to the best
fee-for-service plan possible runs right through the voucher
system.

participation by some physicians over others.
</P>
<P>
   A dissenting member, Stuart Altman, a Brandeis University
professor, argued that Vladeck's proposals might result in
excessive governmental control. He could support them only if
Medicare moved to a system of competing public and private health
plans that would give the beneficiaries attractive ways to opt out
of the traditional government program. .
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck eventually chose Altman's competitive model, which put
him in temporary alliance with at least 10 other commissioners; 11
votes from among the commission's 17 members are needed to forward
a recommendation to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the consensus may be more illusory than real. Much more has
to be agreed on before Vladeck, Altman and other Democratic
appointees will agree on a voucher plan to send to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, primarily a fee-for-service health plan serving about
40 million elderly, pays nearly any bill submitted by any doctor on
behalf of any enrollee. There is little supervision of physician
care. The system excludes prescription drugs and other benefits
routinely provided by private insurance plans but does not hold
down costs. As the baby boomers begin to retire, Medicare costs are
expected to soar to about 5 percent of aggregate income by 2020
from about 2.5 percent today
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to change all that are eight Republican appointees of the
advisory commission along with its chairman, Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. They envision Medicare as a
health care system similar to the one covering federal employees,
who can choose from many insurance plans. Under one version, the
beneficiaries would in effect receive a voucher enabling them to
enroll in either the traditional government plan or in a private
managed-care plan. Each plan would offer an identical package of
core benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The tricky step is assigning a dollar value to the voucher. Many
economists favor plans setting their own premiums. Then the
government would pay a certain amount, say, 75 percent of the cost
of the average plan. The beneficiaries would pay the remaining 25
percent, receiving rebates if they chose inexpensive plans. Under
some versions, the government would provide subsidies for
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   This voucher system _ which proponents call premium support _ is
designed to encourage innovation and to pressure plans to keep
their premiums low. Proponents point out that this plan exposes the
beneficiaries to little risk because it ties the dollar value of
the voucher to the premiums that health plans actually charge in
the market. That way, the voucher will not fall below the amount
that families need to buy the government-mandated benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck and some of the other Democratic appointees disagree.
They are skeptical that private plans will be affordable to
moderate income families or that the government can adequately
supervise the market.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Steelman, a Republican appointee, says that the
commission will have to save enough money to cover the future
deficit in the current program and save more money to pay for any
new benefits that the commission adds. Democratic appointees worry
that the savings cannot be achieved without depriving the
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have so far refused to consider raising taxes to
pay for any new benefits. Ms. Steelman cites the ugly backlash in
1989 after Congress taxed every beneficiary in order to add
benefits that many elderly already received from their former
employers. The uproar forced Congress to repeal the new benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats say the only way to make adequate health
benefits universal is to make them mandatory. Vladeck and Altman
are unlikely to approve a voucher plan that lacks sufficient
revenues for drugs and other essentials and fails to cover
low-income families. They lean toward raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other potential sources of dispute. Should the
commission close some of the future deficit by raising the age of
eligibility? And how will it encourage private plans to cater to
AIDS patients and others requiring expensive care? So what seemed
like an easy consensus last week could quickly break down. The
commission may wind up agreeing only to small-bore fixes that would
keep the program solvent for a few more years. And even if it does
propose a radical overhaul, Congress might not go along.
</P>
<P>
   Yet something of potential importance occurred last week.
Vladeck and other defenders of the current system know they cannot
make traditional Medicare work well unless Congress gives it the
power so long withheld. But, Altman says, the road to the best
fee-for-service plan possible runs right through the voucher
system.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the old days, Russians traveling abroad were often _
and often rightly _ suspected of being KGB agents. Now they are
more likely to be suspected of belonging to something called the
Russian mafia _ a nebulous term that has taken on real meaning in
Budapest, Geneva, Brooklyn, Los Angeles and anywhere else where
Russia's brazen criminal class has managed to set up branch
offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the term ``mafia'' _ an Italian word _ is something of a
misnomer in Russia's freewheeling criminal world. That is one of
the reasons why Sergei Mikhailov was recently set free by a court
in Geneva after being exonerated, in a 10-day trial, of charges
that he is the boss of the largest and most powerful gang in Russia
today.
</P>
<P>
   According to news accounts, the mountain of evidence presented
against Mikhailov, 40, did little more than prove that he is, as he
put it, ``very, very rich,'' and that he has on occasion hung out
with some very unpleasant people connected to Russian gang
activity.
</P>
<P>
   If he were an Italian being tried in Italy, he might well have
been found guilty under a 1982 law that makes ``mafia association''
a criminal offense. With laws like these, Italy's war against
organized crime has scored major victories in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   But for such a law to work against a Russian (assuming that it
would ever be enforced), the first task would be to define the word
``mafia.'' While in Italy the word signifies discreet criminal
organizations with strict hierarchical structures, in Russia it has
come to mean much more. In Russia, it embraces the noxious blend of
crime, politics and business that has engulfed Russia since the
lifting of Communist controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is in the definition,'' said Pino Arlacchi, an
expert on the Italian mafia and a former Italian senator who heads
the United Nations' Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention.
``When you go to court, you have to be able to define what the
mafia is. In Italy, we discovered that there was a formal
structure, with a very precise division of roles, and formal system
for joining. In Russia, you don't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, purists argue that the word ``mafia'' applies only to
the Cosa Nostra, the tightly run Sicilian organization that has
traditionally been the country's most powerful and brutal criminal
group. In the 1980s, when hundreds of Sicilian mafiosi were put on
trial and convicted, the Cosa Nostra's dominant Corleone clan
lashed out with a campaign of terror that culminated in the
assassination in 1992 of Giovanni Falcone, Sicily's top prosecutor.
Today all but one of the top leaders of the Cosa Nostra _ members
of its ``cupola'' or board of directors _ are in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Of Italy's other regional crime groups, the Camorra in Naples is
the most anarchic, a loose band of gangs whose penetration into
local society has been more difficult to root out. According to
Arlaachi, Russian organized crime is closer in kind to the
Neapolitan version, although even in Naples, he conceded, the
Neapolitans abide by rules that the Russians routinely ignore.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlaachi's view, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Russian
crime can be attributed to organized crime, in the mafia sense of
the word. ``Most of these groups have proliferated very quickly,
taking advantage of the weakening of the state,'' he said. ``They
are not concerned about a high level of organization. They are too
busy exploiting the opportunities they have in front of them. They
use violence in ways that to a Sicilian mafioso would be
inconceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Russians and foreigners who do business here, the
collusion between criminals and bureaucrats, between gunrunners and
bankers, between policemen and thieves is so widespread and runs so
deep that untangling the links is now virtually impossible, not to
mention dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The intermingling of legal and illegal business dates back to
the late 1980s, when cooperatives were first allowed to creep
through the cracks in the state-controlled economy, before a legal
framework was ready to promote and protect private enterprise.
Rackets soon sprang up in the cooperatives' shadow, offering both
protection and a method of settling disputes.
</P>
<P>
   As business became more sophisticated, criminal gangs followed
suit. By the early 1990s, small businesses whose bank accounts had
grown to critical levels were likely to get a visit by men who,
tipped off by their agents inside the banking system, would offer
their protective services in return for a share of profit, or
alternatively a loan on terms that were hard to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   By its very essence, the Russian version of the mafia defies the
Italian definition of a secret society, which until recently
protected itself by a wall of silence. In Russia, there is no oath
of silence, or ``omerta,'' as the Sicilians call it. Instead, crime
groups have an open-door policy that over the last 10 years has
been wide enough to let in a large swath of society, willingly and
unwillingly, from policemen to bankers, from politicians to
industrialists.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian criminal world has come a long way from the
now-legendary days of the ``thieves in law,'' a peculiar term given
to criminals who during their long stints in Soviet prisons were
crowned by their peers as the ultimate arbiters of criminal
disputes. Such men still exist but their authority has been
undermined by a de facto legitimization of crime that started with
run-of-the-mill racketeering, gambling and prostitution, and
gradually climbed up through the ranks of government.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Mikhailov, who 15 years ago was a waiter at a
Moscow hotel. Sent to prison in 1984 for insurance fraud (he stole
his own motorcycle), he made the contacts that, according to police
and press reports, were to lay the groundwork for the rest of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   After prison, he set up a local sports organization and was
allowed to travel abroad in 1986, despite Soviet-era controls
barring most Russians from leaving the country. He was arrested
twice again _ once for racketeering, another time for the murder of
a casino owner _ but was not convicted.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his arrest in Switzerland in 1996, Mikhailov was
an international operator with an empire that was said to include a
hotel in Budapest, a banana-exporting business in Costa Rica and
interests in Israel, Belgium and across the former Soviet Union.
Witnesses at the trial testified that his arrest broke up
negotiations on two contracts totaling $350 million, one involving
the laying of a new sewage system in Moscow, the other the
construction of a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
   So how did a former waiter become a multi-billionaire, with a
home in Switzerland, a Costa Rican diplomatic passport, and the
kind of insider political contacts that can make or break a
business in Russia?
</P>
<P>
   On his arrival in Moscow before a bank of television cameras,
Mikhailov had an answer. Flashing a V-for-victory sign, he told
reporters that his exoneration by the Swiss was proof not only that
``Russians are not necessarily criminals,'' but that ``they can be
businessmen who contribute to the development of the economy of
Russia.''

FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES FOR THE JETS: WHO WILL RUN? WHO WILL STOP IT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to Bryan Cox, time bomb turned team spokesman, to break
down the essence of Sunday's Jets-Jacksonville Jaguars playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know our guys will score some points,'' Cox, the linebacker
coerced out of retirement to become a Jet, said in the team's
locker room after a spirited Friday practice in the snow. ``Will
our defense make sure those points are enough?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe what all this comes down to is this: Who's still running
the ball at the end like they want to, and who's had to give up and
throw and throw and throw?''
</P>
<P>
   There are many variables in Sunday's game at Giants Stadium,
from the weather and the wind at game time to the health of
Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell's sore left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have a quarterback, Vinny Testaverde, whose last
playoff experience was four years ago, and that game ended with
Testaverde on the wrong end of a 20-point defeat. The Jets also
have an unpredictable kicker in John Hall while the Jaguars have
Mike Hollis, the most accurate place-kicker in National Football
League history.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the matchup within the matchups that may matter most
could be: Which team can enforce its will on the ground?
</P>
<P>
   With the fourth-best offense in the league, the Jets have been
committed to a balanced attack, but the passing game has been
predicated on play-action passes made effective by a power running
game. And Jets Coach Bill Parcells has proven this season that he
will not abandon the running game, regardless of lackluster early
results.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Martin rushed 369 times in 1998, the third-highest number
of carries in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jacksonville's defense ranked 25th among the 30 teams,
there is general belief that the Jets will be able to move the ball
on the ground and eventually through the air. It follows that
Jacksonville's best shot at victory is a high-scoring game.
</P>
<P>
   The key, therefore, could be how the Jets' linebackers fare
against Fred Taylor, Jacksonville's rookie running back, and how
well Cox can contain the scrambling of Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who has averaged 112.5 rushing yards in his last five
starts, goes against a Jets team that has not allowed a 100-yard
rusher in its last 10 games. Taylor is fresh off a 162-yard rushing
performance in the Jaguars' first-round victory over the New
England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell has reportedly exhibited no ill effects of the ankle
problem that kept him out of three games at the end of the regular
season. If he is healthy enough to bolt the pocket and run, the
Jets may have their hands full.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jaguars' playoff push to the verge of the 1997 Super
Bowl, Brunell rushed for 78 yards in two post-season games. Perhaps
significantly, when the Denver Broncos routed Jacksonville in the
first playoff round last season, Brunell rushed three times for
just four yards.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to Bill Belichick, the Jets' defensive
coordinator, to devise a scheme that stops the explosive Taylor
while keeping an eye on the clever Brunell _ not mention the
two-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Jimmy Smith and his sidekick Keenan
McCardell, a former Pro Bowler who has caught six passes in each of
his last three playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big assignment,'' Parcells said Friday. ``Taylor can be
relentless, but like us, Jacksonville isn't totally reliant on one
dimension, which is why both teams are still playing this time of
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox has respect for Taylor and Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taylor's probably the league m.v.p. if not for Randy Moss,''
Cox said. ``Like they say, Brunell can be the next Steve Young. You
can't let him roam. Historically, at playoff time, running the
football is how you win. Stopping the run is how you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells knows why he has thrust Cox into the role of run
stopper _ as well as named him the probable defensive ``spy'' who
will shadow Brunell all over the field Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings explosive hitting ability,'' Parcells said of Cox.
``This guy has been running the defense, he can take on blockers,
he's not afraid to battle, he's not afraid to play one-on-one
football, and he never resorts to finesse.''
</P>
<P>
   Think Parcells is happy he made that July 31 call to Cox,
convincing him to come out of retirement?
</P>
<P>
   Cox knows he's happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I'd feel like this again,'' he said. ``I didn't
know if football would ever be worth it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The role Cox and his fellow linebackers Mo Lewis and Pepper
Johnson play against the run may be especially significant because
of the work of Jacksonville's talented offensive tackles, Tony
Boselli and Leon Searcy. If that duo can control the line of
scrimmage, the Jets' linebackers will have to fill the gaps and
anticipate Taylor's cutback moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a gutsy bunch, but we're smart as a defense,'' Lewis
said. ``There's some kind of problem in almost every game, but we
go to the sideline and talk it over with Belichick. We adjust very
well. I'm sure there will be adjustments we'll have to make
again.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, as Cox has predicted, it's likely that one team
will still be running the football while the other is forced to
play catch-up through the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different time of the year now and the spirit of the
game is usually higher,'' Parcells said. ``Players get nervous,
their moods change. Emotions are going to be high. And at times
like those, I tell our people we have to rely on fundamental
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust the fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   And nothing in football is more fundamental than establishing
the run and stopping the run. &QL;

   TOBACCO-WINDFALL (Undated) _ As state legislatures nationwide
start new sessions, lawmakers are beginning to debate how to spend
their biggest windfall in recent years: tens of billions of dollars
from tobacco settlement deals. While some elected officials are
calling for the money to be spent on health care initiatives and
anti-smoking campaigns, others are urging that it be used on
projects unrelated to tobacco, including new schools or jails, and
even sidewalk repair. Still other lawmakers say the tobacco
windfall should be used to eliminate state debts or be given to
taxpayers as rebates. By Barry Meier.

   IMPEACH-EVIDENCE (Washington) _ The Senate's agreement on how to
conduct the initial phase of President Clinton's impeachment trial
sent House prosecutors and the President's lawyers diving this
weekend back into the voluminous evidence collected by the
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. In the 7,000 pages of grand jury
testimony and boxes of supplementary evidence, Rep. Henry Hyde, the
leader of the House prosecution team, sees a clear and convincing
picture of perjury and obstruction of justice so grave that Clinton
should be removed from office. From that same pile of evidence, the
president's legal team is putting together a more aggressive
defense than the one they presented unsuccessfully to the House _
one they now say should lead to the president's exoneration. The
White House agreed to stipulate to the record amassed by the
independent counsel, although the president's lawyers profoundly
disagree with Starr and Hyde about what the evidence shows. By Jill
Abramson.

elections. Hyde is now throwing himself wholeheartedly into his new
role as Clinton's chief prosecutor in the Senate. Rep. David Dreier
of California, one of his closest friends on the Hill, said Hyde's
attitude was: ``If you're going to catch hell no matter what you
do, you might as well do what's right.'' By Melinda Henneberger.

   DOCS-REBEL (New York) _ While 92 percent of doctors in New York
state accepted managed care last year, it seems a small rebellion
is on. Fed up with years of acrimonious relationships with
managed-care companies, doctors, particularly those serving upper
middle class patients, are quietly starting to fight back. Many are
dropping plans that have the lowest reimbursement rates, biggest
administrative headaches or represent the fewest number of their
patients. Others are washing their hands of the carriers, forcing
patients to pay up front and file claims the old-fashioned way, or
pay the fees themselves. By Jennifer Steinhauer.

   THE `DON'T DO' LIST
</P>
<P>
   Paul Quantrill, a Toronto pitcher, broke his right leg last week
driving a snowmobile. Thinking it would not sound as bad, he
initially said he had an accident on a toboggan. Neither pursuit is
barred in Quantrill's contract.
</P>
<P>
   However, the uniform player's contract has a paragraph, 5(b),
that prohibits players from engaging in other sports. Professional
boxing and wrestling are barred outright. The provision then lists
a series of sports that the player cannot play except with his
team's written consent: skiing, auto racing, motorcycle racing, sky
diving or any game or exhibition of football, soccer, professional
league basketball, ice hockey or other sports ``involving a
substantial risk of personal injury.'' At times a club, with the
player's assent, will add other specific sports to the list.
</P>
<P>
   THE TAX THAT DIDN'T WORK
</P>
<P>
   While the overwhelming consensus is that the National Basketball
Association owners got much the better of their labor agreement
with the players, the baseball owners have to continue to wonder
what they have to do to win one. They certainly didn't win the
234-day players strike in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   If they didn't know it before, the owners, with the computation
of the 1998 luxury tax on the five highest payrolls, have to
realize they have been hornswoggled.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury tax was intended to inhibit mammoth payrolls. The
idea was the owners would not want to pay hefty taxes on top of a
large payroll. But all it takes is six large payrolls, and the
threshold that triggers the 35 percent tax becomes so high that it
keeps the taxes low.
</P>
<P>
   The threshold is the average between the fifth- and
sixth-highest payrolls, meaning the figure for 1998 was $70.5
million. The basic agreement, written two years ago, projected the
threshold as $55 million. The projected trigger level for 1999 is
$58.9 million, but it will be at least $75.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   What does the tax mean for 1998? The Baltimore Orioles, who,
under the formula for determining payrolls for luxury tax purposes,
had the No. 1 payroll, $79.5 million, will have to pay $3,138,621
as their tax. That's not much more than utility infielders make
these days.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox, at $2,184,734, have to pay the only other
tax that exceeds $685,000. The others: Yankees, $684,390; the
Braves, $495,625; the Dodgers, $49,593. Conclusion: The luxury tax,
which this year drops to 34 percent, has not been and never will be
a payroll deterrent.

COLD MAKES IT HARD TO GET THE FEAST  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By NELSON BRYANT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST TISBURY, Mass. _ For the past few years, bagging a brace of
ducks for a celebratory Christmas dinner and another pair for a New
Year's Day repast has been difficult for me on the island of
Martha's Vineyard, but this year it was different.
</P>
<P>
   It was different because in 1998 the weather turned around. Fall
and early winter were unusually mild, and it seemed as if a repeat
of the previous seasons was on its way, but in late December high
winds, cold and snow swept across New England with regularity. In
mild weather, so-called puddle ducks _ among them blacks, mallards,
teal and pintails _ tend to remain on broad expanses of open water,
safe from hunters' guns.
</P>
<P>
   Wind and ice get ducks moving; small ponds freeze, forcing them
to seek open water in lakes and salt ponds. If a fierce storm is
under way, they tend to lose their usual caution and instead of
carefully surveying a nimrod's spread of decoys from on high, they
come streaming in low over the water and often settle among the
bogus birds without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a limit to the conditions under which ducks
choose to fly. More than 50 years ago, I went to my waterfowling
blind during a blizzard, and, enjoying the storm, remained in it
until after dark. Walking home across a plowed field, I suddenly
became aware of movement all about me. The field, raw frozen earth
covered with new snow, was alive with black ducks. Some took wing;
others simply scuttled away. They had been driven to earth by the
wind and swirling snow, less than a half mile from the sanctuary of
the swamp and salt pond where I had been waiting for them in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Until late in the just-ended duck season (Nov. 16-Jan. 9) in
coastal Massachusetts, there were few migratory birds from up north
on hand. The fall and early winter had been too mild. All the ducks
my son Jeff and I shot in several outings were mallards, and most
were resident birds. The crops of many of them were packed with
cracked corn that they had gobbled up while visiting various
private and public freshwater ponds where such handouts have become
a ritual on the Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   We shot six mallards on our Christmas Day dinner hunt and three
on the New Year's Day excursion. On the latter sortie, we would
have done better were it not for my ineptitude and bouts of
nostalgia. We had split up, Jeff going to the open marsh in Town
Cove on Tisbury Great Pond, I in a blind at the point where Mill
Brook enters the cove.
</P>
<P>
   Walking down the brook to the blind, past the cavern created by
the twisted roots of a still-living willow that had been blown over
in a hurricane decades before, I got to within 10 feet of a hen
mallard that was dozing on the shore. We saw each other at the same
instant. She sprang vertically into the air, while I _ deep in a
recollection of the time more than 65 years ago when I had caught
my first brook trout from the pool at my feet _ forgot that I was
hunting and watched her depart. Three seconds or more elapsed
before my shotgun was at my shoulder, and by then it was too late
to fire.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving to concentrate on my quest, I reached my wind-buffeted
blind, put out a few decoys and sat awaiting the arrival of
shelter-seeking ducks. The wind was out of the northwest, gusting
to 50 miles an hour, and the temperature, which was falling, was
about 15 degrees. I saw no ducks the first 30 minutes but was
visited by two curious catbirds that appeared to be eating the
bright red fruits of winterberries on the edge of the swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Near sundown, mallards began to fly. They came in from the
south, but always, when still far out of range, turned and headed
for the west side of the marsh where a tiny stream trickles in. An
occasional shot came from that direction, so I assumed that Jeff
was succeeding in his meal-gathering quest.
</P>
<P>
   A small duck _ at first I thought it was a leaf _ hurtled,
twisting and turning, past the bare, writhing, lichen-festooned
branches of an ancient willow on the opposite side of the brook and
plopped down among my decoys. A female wood duck, it swam up to one
of the decoys and whistled at it. Not getting any response, it
paddled a few feet to shore and sat on a rock.
</P>
<P>
   It was legal game, but I was not moved to shoot it. I wanted a
big, fat corn-fed mallard, not an unsuspecting little bird that
weighs about a pound and a half in full plumage. I later learned
that Jeff had made the same decision when a wood duck _ we assumed
that it was the same bird _ had visited him.
</P>
<P>
   My fingers, in lined, leather gloves, were getting numb, but
because light was failing and because there would only be a few
seconds in which to spot and shoot a low-flying duck, I resisted
putting my hands in my jacket pockets. A lone mallard, the only one
that was to come to me that night, flew in low, headed up the brook
and made slow progress against the violent gusts of wind. It was an
easy shot. I swung on it, but my half-frozen thumb slipped off the
safety. By the time I did manage to fire I missed with both
barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff's shadowy figure materialized through the cattails a few
minutes later. He had three mallards in hand and my brother Danny's
affable and affectionate Labrador retriever Duchess trailing
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny was on my side of the marsh,'' Jeff said, ``and Duchess
joined me after I shot the first time. She saved me a lot of work.
She retrieved two of my birds.'' Jeff's gain, however, proved to be
Danny's loss. He later dropped two mallards that he couldn't reach,
but Duchess ignored his whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Duchess became increasingly subdued on our ride to Danny's house
to return her. She clearly comprehended her breach of allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Danny pulled into the yard behind us, sans ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has happened before,'' he said, ignoring his dog's
tentative show of apology. ``She can't resist guns going off and
ducks falling.'' &QL;

20 YEARS ON, ANGER IGNITES AGAINST KHMER ROUGE
</HEADLINE>
 (Editors: also see CAMBODIA-PROFESSIONS-REVIEW) 
(bl) 
By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ ``I'm just a small person,'' said Un
Samath, a customs inspector, using a common phrase among
Cambodians, ``so I dare not say.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he got angry, and he said it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate them,'' he said of the defecting Khmer Rouge leaders
who recently flaunted their impunity in a tourist trip around
Cambodia. ``So long as it doesn't cause a war, I want to see them
on trial. Cambodians cannot be happy as long as they are happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, like a man who has decided that the time has come to
speak, Un Samath, 46, described the pain he shares with almost
every other Cambodian of his generation _ the killings of family
members, the years of fear and hunger, the loss of youth and
education, the continuing harshness of life.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one of countless unburdenings that are taking place
among Cambodians today as the country seems to be embarking,
spontaneously, on a long-delayed national conversation about its
traumatic past.
</P>
<P>
   In Phnom Penh, the capital, and in Battambang, the country's
second-largest city, interviews with a score of people from market
vendors to professors suggest that a common legacy of anger and
pain is being shared in a new way.
</P>
<P>
   As Cambodia struggles to break with its feudal past, the
comments also suggest an emerging political assertiveness among
people better informed and more aware of their rights. Recently,
several political parties and labor unions have formed, and people
are coming forward to seek redress for land seizure or the dumping
of toxic waste _ evils that in the past they might simply have
accepted as their fate.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly near-unanimous view is that Khmer Rouge leaders
should be put on trial, if only to determine who is really to blame
for the country's suffering _ and even if any convictions are
followed by an amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   If this is so, it offers a response to those who fear that
international pressure for a trial amounts to a new burden imposed
on an already traumatized people. It is also a response to the
defectors' assertion that pressure for a trial comes from a foreign
intervention against the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   There has still been no real assessment of the national will.
Prime Minister Hun Sen has asserted that people do not want a
trial, while King Norodom Sihanouk has stated that they do.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1975 and 1979, more than a million Cambodians died from
malnutrition, overwork, untreated diseases or executions. After a
wave of anger and mourning in the early 1980s, Cambodia settled
into a state of stunned and sluggish denial, its psychic wounds
unacknowledged and festering.
</P>
<P>
   The surrender of the two Khmer Rouge leaders _ Khieu Samphan and
Nuon Chea _ and their welcome by the government have apparently,
without anyone having intended or foreseen it, aroused these buried
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, the defections have ignited the feelings of the
people,'' said Kao Kim Hourn, who heads a private office studying
regional policy, the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the major topic now that people talk about,'' he said.
``People from all walks of life have begun to question what
happened in that period. They share a common past, a common
suffering and therefore a common outrage when they see these mass
killers returning to the mainstream of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say that even as international pressure grows to put
Khmer Rouge leaders on trial for crimes against humanity, a dozen
of them are living freely now in Cambodia, following the collapse
of their guerrilla movement in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   If public pressure built, it could affect the fate of these
figures in a country where the voice of the ``small people'' has
not generally been heard by the ``big people'' in power.
</P>
<P>
   After Hun Sen welcomed the defectors two weeks ago, saying, ``We
should dig a hole and bury the past,'' he found it politically
necessary to issue what he called a clarification a few days later
and declare that he was all for justice.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has not yet said whether it will seek to
arrest the defectors, who are now in Pailin, a remote town near the
Thai border where they are protected by armed former guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is becoming difficult for the government to just dictate to
the people and ignore public opinion,'' Kao Kim Hourn said.
``People have reached a certain level of maturity. They have more
access to information, they don't have to be so much concerned
about food and security and another war.''
</P>
<P>
   With popular emotions stirring, he said, ``internal pressure on
the government has begun to build up.'' He added: ``National
reconciliation at all costs? Bury the past? Forgive and forget? No.
I don't think that is the case now.''
</P>
<P>
   If indeed a new, more politically demanding society is emerging,
it may be one positive legacy of the huge international effort at
democratization organized by the United Nations at the start of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violent power politics that has persistently stunted
the establishment of democracy and human rights, a fledgling civil
society has begun to emerge, addressing everything from education
to flood control. This society is led by some 200 local
nongovernmental agencies, most with foreign funding.
</P>
<P>
   The country's nascent discussion also offers a remembrance of
the dead as people recount their losses.
</P>
<P>
   When they talk about the past, Cambodians commonly offer lists
of family members who died at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. Two
decades have passed, and this may be the last chance the country
has to seek an accounting on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   King Sihanouk himself, in a statement Thursday, published a list
of victims that included 5 children, 14 grandchildren, 2 cousins, a
half-uncle and a son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kao Kim Hourn, 32, lost a younger brother and sister. He said he
still dreamed about them. When he was a college student in the
United States, he said, his roommate called him ``the wall beater''
because of his violent nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Chhour Sokheang, 44, a university instructor, lost his father,
an uncle, an aunt, a cousin and about 25 other family members.
``Everybody is talking about it now,'' he said, ``my friends, my
students _ many, many people. Everybody says that now the Khmer
Rouge leaders are very lucky. When they had their forces, they
fought and killed Cambodian people. But when they lost, they came
back and the government welcomed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lim Navy, 39, who sells construction material, says she lost an
uncle, two uncles-in-law and more cousins than she can count. ``If
we start thinking about what the Khmer Rouge did,'' she said, ``we
just want to chop them up like minced pork.''
</P>
<P>
   Life then was filled with miseries both big and small, she said,
some of which can only be recalled with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   She recited a ditty that people shared secretly in the Khmer
Rouge years: ``Democratic woman with fleas on her head, democratic
woman with ringworms on her body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We even had fleas in our eyebrows,'' Mrs. Lim Navy said.
</P>
<P>
   People's lingering traumas assert themselves in unpredictable
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Kao Kim Hourn said he could not overcome a fear of starvation.
``All Cambodians who have been through this experience share
this,'' he said. ``At a restaurant we order much more food than we
can finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lim Navy said she could not shake off a rumor that had
circulated among her friends at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to hear a truck at nighttime,'' she said, ``and people
said it was carrying bile from corpses to China. Ever since then I
haven't been able to drink wine from China. I'm afraid it's made
out of the bile of dead Cambodians.''

HOW HENRY HYDE'S RESOLVE WAS SHAPED AGAINST CLINTON

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A year ago, after the first reports of the
president's affair with Monica Lewinsky, Rep. Henry Hyde reacted
predictably enough, tamping down what he clearly saw as a lot of
loose, hotheaded talk about impeachment: ``You don't impeach him
for a peccadillo,'' he said then.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also said the president would not be impeached without
bipartisan agreement. He said public support was important, too.
And he promised that under his leadership, the House Judiciary
Committee proceedings would be marked by comity and bring honor to
the Congress. ``If we fall into partisan bickering, we will
disgrace this institution,'' he said in September. ``And we're not
about to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Good old Henry, whispered the Democrats, confident that the
famously fair-minded and genteel gentleman from Illinois would keep
the real partisans in check. Let the hard-liners howl at the moon,
the thinking went. Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia could hold his breath
until he turned purple but, thank God, Henry Hyde was the man in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in yet another twist in the labyrinthian Lewinsky scandal,
good old Henry surprised everyone. He opposed a Democratic proposal
that would have limited the inquiry and instead toyed with
expanding it. He argued against a censure option. And he presided
over hearings dominated by partisan attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Was this the same Henry Hyde who once had Democrats cheering his
opposition to Republican proposals on term limits? Yes, friends
said, but it was also a man whose position had hardened
considerably over the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by what he came to see as President Clinton's cavalier
attitude toward the law, the investigation and the committee, and
boxed in by Democrats who he felt had no intention of working with
him, the friends said, Hyde became convinced that he had no choice
but to push forward and impeach the president without them.
</P>
<P>
   As with some others who have gone up against Clinton, these
friends said, Hyde's reluctance gradually turned to resolve and his
hesitation to absolute certainty.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton was impeached _ without either bipartisan support
or popular approval, for behavior that did stem from what many
people dismissed as a peccadillo _ it was in no small measure as a
result of Hyde's determination to press forward.
</P>
<P>
   And now Hyde, who has lately been listening to the original
Broadway cast's recording of ``Man of La Mancha,'' is throwing
himself wholeheartedly into his new role as Clinton's chief
prosecutor in the Senate. Rep. David Dreier of California, one of
Hyde's closest friends on Capitol Hill, said the Judiciary
Committee chairman's attitude was ``If you're going to catch hell
no matter what you do, you might as well do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   After appointing a conservative team of prosecutors, Hyde was
pushing for a full trial with witnesses and fighting any effort to
truncate that process. Last week, some senators began grumbling
that they did not know who had died and made him ``Senator'' Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's resolve has been nearly unwavering from the start of his
committee's deliberations in October. Contrary to expectations that
he might be dissuaded by the Republicans' poor showing in the
November elections, his friends said, that drubbing, coupled with
persistent criticism from colleagues, had exactly the opposite
effect. If anything, it only emboldened Hyde to proceed without
worrying about the fallout, since both he and his party were
already taking some hits.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was Hyde in any way deterred by the disclosure, in the
fall, of an extramarital affair he had decades ago. A devout Roman
Catholic, Hyde spoke on the House floor of his great shame over the
relationship, but believed, too, that there is a clear difference
between a sin and a crime. ``To liken violations of the vows to
perjury,'' Dreier said, ``is just their attempt to bring about
similarities.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said Hyde had recovered from
the disclosure of his affair far more quickly than he had from a
recent incident involving the actor Alec Baldwin. On late night
television, Baldwin said, ``If we were in other countries ... all
of us together would go down to Washington and we would stone Henry
Hyde to death! We would stone him to death and we would go to their
homes and we'd kill their wives and their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin later apologized and said the bit was intended as
satire, but Sensenbrenner said Hyde, who has received death threats
and travels with four security guards, has been worried about his
family's safety ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dreier, who had lunch with Hyde on Thursday after he
presented the articles of impeachment in the Senate, said his
friend was in good spirits that day, joking, enjoying some ``real
crab cakes,'' and chatting about movies. (Hyde had already seen
``You've Got Mail,'' dismissing it as ``a chick flick,'' Dreier
said, and had tried to coax him into seeing the Adam Sandler
goofathon ``The Waterboy,'' with him this weekend.)
</P>
<P>
   Hyde is not plagued by doubts about whether he is doing the
right thing, Dreier said. ``He's just rolling with it now.''
</P>
<P>
   But for others, the transformation has been jarring _
``breathtaking,'' said the Congress-watcher Tom Mann of the
Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one thinks pressure from the party's conservative base
was much of a factor. This is Henry Hyde, they said, author of the
Hyde amendment, a hero to opponents of abortion and, at 74, a man
with nothing to prove.
</P>
<P>
   His friends insist that politics is not driving Hyde at all: As
one friend said, ``What's the political benefit to doing what he's
doing? If we find one more Jane Doe, Clinton's approval rating will
be at 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., said: ``The conventional wisdom
was that it was not in our interest to proceed, so why would we
want to? To enhance Al Gore's chances? Censure would have been much
more politically expedient, but he went the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Hyde under any obvious pressure from party leaders. ``I
don't think he was under orders here,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler,
D-N.Y. ``I think he just got more determined as time went on.''
</P>
<P>
   And friends say Nadler and other Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee are partly responsible for that evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's attitude shifted as he began to despair of being able to
work across the aisle as he had originally hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt he wasn't getting cooperation from the other side of
the aisle, so in kind he decided he had to get the job done with
Republicans,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn. ``It was a
polarized committee, and he thought in the end that the Democrats
had a strategy that didn't allow for much common ground. Henry was
ultimately the leader of this polarized and partisan outcome, but
he didn't want it that way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner, who sat next to Hyde on the committee and on a
couple of occasions sat in for him when the chairman ducked out for
a moment to cool down, said: ``Henry can get his back up when he
thinks he's being used. Everything he did the partisan pit bulls
sharply criticized.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadler seemed happy to acknowledge getting under the chairman's
skin. ``Henry is a very determined guy and I think he was getting
exasperated at Democrats' not playing along,'' Nadler said,
laughing. ``We were not going to make his job any easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats on the committee said they felt Hyde was
influenced by his counsel, David Schippers, who also began his work
with an aura of bipartisanship as a lifelong Democrat but soon
adopted a hard line regarding the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, another Democrat on the
committee, said he thought he saw signs of what he called the
``bridge over the River Kwai syndrome.'' ``After a while, pride of
craft takes over,'' Frank said, ``and you just want to build the
bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   At a number of junctures, Hyde's associates said, he was
frustrated by what he came to see as Clinton's disrespect for the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is deeply offended by the president's conduct during this
entire matter'' in ways that have ``nothing to do with his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky,'' Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, colleagues said, Hyde became convinced that he
had no choice but to protect the court system that he felt would be
seriously undermined if every citizen with a skeleton in his closet
decided under which circumstances it might be permissible to lie
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   And after Hyde saw Clinton's answers to the 81 questions the
committee had put to him, several people close to him said Hyde
felt there was no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   One person familiar with Hyde's thinking over the last few
months said that ``after the nonresponsive answers on the 81
questions, he said in a meeting of fellow Republicans, `Boys, I
don't see what choice we have now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly underestimated by the White House, Hyde was, in the
end, ``critical in convincing Republicans to impeach him anyway
after the election,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They mistook a teddy-bear exterior for a soft core,'' said
Ralph Reed, the Republican strategist, who knows Hyde well. ``If he
feels strongly about something, he'll fight harder than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one can doubt that Hyde now feels strongly about the case
against Clinton.

   U.S. Admits Using Spies In Arms Inspection Team
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officers
worked undercover on teams of United Nations Special Commission
inspectors ferreting out secret Iraqi weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   They said U.S. intelligence agencies provided
electronic-eavesdropping equipment and secret information to the
special commission.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, they said, the United States received information on
Iraqi weapons programs that the inspectors uncovered. Iraq has long
accused the commission of being riddled with ``American spies and
agents.''

   The last child of Britain's Queen Elizabeth, Prince Edward, 34,
has decided to marry his longtime girlfriend, Sophie Rhys-Jones,

announcement was mixed with expressions of anxiety over whether he
could do better than his three siblings, all of whose youthful
marriages ended in divorce.

   Things are promisingly different this time. The couple has been

   The hunt for extraterrestrial life picked up speed as NASA
launched the second of two new spacecraft toward Mars.

<P>
   Mars Climate Orbiter was launched from Florida on Dec. 11, now
joined by Mars Polar Lander. The latter craft is to look deep
beneath the Martian surface in search of water, which is considered
the key ingredient for life.

<P>
   The new lander also carries a tiny microphone, paid for by the
Planetary Society, a private group in Pasadena, Calif., that backs
space exploration. The experiment's goal is to beam back sounds of
winds, lightning and any aliens that happen to amble by, though
that is considered unlikely.

   The first wave of craft left for Mars in 1996 and the series, if
money holds up, is to continue at least through 2012.

demonstrated his flair for the unconventional _ licensing Jesse
Ventura action figures and T-shirts to replenish his campaign
treasury, giving few hints of his policies and suggesting that his
wife, Terry, merits a state salary.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ventura, for her part, wasn't asking for compensation; she
was expressing shell shock about the whole first lady gig. ``The

   A Small Break For Black Farmers
</P>
<P>
   The farm life is a life of struggle.
</P>
<P>
   To make a profit, farmers must overcome weather, pests,
temperamental markets and intense competition. Black farmers
maintain that they have had to battle an additional obstacle in
recent decades _ racism _ and now the U.S. Department of
Agriculture has acknowledged that complaint. It settled a
class-action lawsuit filed by black farmers who maintained that
department officials discriminated in the processing of federal
farm loans.
</P>
<P>
   While not admitting bias, the department offered to pay $50,000
to black farmers claiming discrimination and to forgive their
outstanding federal debt. Noting that only 1 percent of today's
farmers are black, down from 14 percent in 1920, many black farmers
said the settlement came far too late.

   A Tiny Opening to Cuba With Little Political Risk

   The Clinton administration took steps to allow more U.S. money,
air planes, food and mail flow into Cuba, with an eye toward the
day when Fidel Castro no longer rules the isolated island. But the

Cuban-Americans, rejected calls for creating a national commission
that would study the 37-year-old American economic embargo that has

   A British Scandal Claims Another Victim
</P>
<P>
   A third official has fallen from the British government of Prime

an end to the kind of behavior that led 12 ministers in the
previous Conservative government of John Major to depart in
disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Quitting just before Christmas were Paymaster General Geoffrey
Robinson, 60, a millionaire industrialist and politician who had
given Trade and Industry Minister Peter Mandelson, 45, a $620,000
home loan, and Mandelson, Blair's closest confidant, who kept the
loan a secret even after Robinson's financial affairs came under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim was Charlie Whelan, the press secretary to
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, the second most powerful
man in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Whelan's crime was to have conducted a negative campaign against
Mandelson.

amounts to a tax cut for the middle class. People with relatively
high incomes would be ineligible, as would people with incomes so
low that they do not have to pay income taxes.

   Horace Deets, executive director of the American Association of
Retired Persons, said the tax credit of $1,000 a year would provide
``long-overdue recognition'' to families caring for relatives.

   When you reach the fork in the road, take it, Yogi Berra is said
to have once told a friend who was coming to visit. Last week, when
George Steinbrenner, the New York Yankees' principal owner, made
his way to Berra's home turf to ask that they bury their 14-year
feud, the Hall of Fame catcher decided it was time for both men to
take the high road. ``Fourteen years,'' his son, Dale, told him,
``is long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   So Berra opened his arms _ and the museum bearing his name on
the Montclair State University campus in New Jersey _ to the man
who dismissed him as Yankee manager through an intermediary in
1985. The Boss told Berra that failing to deliver the bad news in
person was ``the worst mistake I ever made in baseball'' and
pleaded with him to return to Yankee Stadium next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' Berra said, unwilling to firmly commit himself to
taking this latest fork. But his smile gave him away. Yogi, it
seems, is finally going home.

   The Happiest Michael Jordan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one was happier with the salvation of the National Basketball
Association season last week than Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the world's greatest hoopster. The Michael Jordan who
averages 17 points per game for the University of Pennsylvania, a
very mortal No. 23 who, in the absence of the NBA, became fodder
for America's sports announcers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they'll stop killing me with the jokes,'' Jordan said on
the telephone before Penn played Yale in an Ivy League game Friday.
``One night I hear about a guy on ESPN starting his highlights,
`Jordan . . . from the top of the key . . . . airball.' With no
NBA, when you're in a little slump and your name is Michael Jordan,
the whole world knows.''
</P>
<P>
   The professional players and owners finally reached agreement on
Wednesday after an all-night bargaining session Tuesday night, in a
deal that promises labor peace into the next century with the
league having achieved its main goal of containing the contracts of
high-salaried players.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows if Chicago's Michael Jordan will retire or not. As
for Penn's Michael Jordan, the accidental lockout casualty from
Philadelphia whose mother named him after her favorite cousin, he's
elated at the NBA's rturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I needed incentive to go out and perform well before,
but without the jokes, maybe it will be easier.''

   When you reach the fork in the road, take it, Yogi Berra is said
to have once told a friend who was coming to visit. Last week, when
George Steinbrenner, the New York Yankees' principal owner, made
his way to Berra's home turf to ask that they bury their 14-year
feud, the Hall of Fame catcher decided it was time for both men to
take the high road. ``Fourteen years,'' his son, Dale, told him,
``is long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   So Berra opened his arms _ and the museum bearing his name on
the Montclair State University campus in New Jersey _ to the man
who dismissed him as Yankee manager through an intermediary in
1985. The Boss told Berra that failing to deliver the bad news in
person was ``the worst mistake I ever made in baseball'' and
pleaded with him to return to Yankee Stadium next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' Berra said, unwilling to firmly commit himself to
taking this latest fork. But his smile gave him away. Yogi, it
seems, is finally going home.

   The Happiest Michael Jordan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one was happier with the salvation of the National Basketball
Association season last week than Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the world's greatest hoopster. The Michael Jordan who
averages 17 points per game for the University of Pennsylvania, a
very mortal No. 23 who, in the absence of the NBA, became fodder
for America's sports announcers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they'll stop killing me with the jokes,'' Jordan said on
the telephone before Penn played Yale in an Ivy League game Friday.
``One night I hear about a guy on ESPN starting his highlights,
`Jordan . . . from the top of the key . . . . airball.' With no
NBA, when you're in a little slump and your name is Michael Jordan,
the whole world knows.''
</P>
<P>
   The professional players and owners finally reached agreement on
Wednesday after an all-night bargaining session Tuesday night, in a
deal that promises labor peace into the next century with the
league having achieved its main goal of containing the contracts of
high-salaried players.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows if Chicago's Michael Jordan will retire or not. As
for Penn's Michael Jordan, the accidental lockout casualty from
Philadelphia whose mother named him after her favorite cousin, he's
elated at the NBA's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I needed incentive to go out and perform well before,
but without the jokes, maybe it will be easier.''
</P>

ANGRY AT MANAGED CARE, DOCTORS START FIGHTING BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Calif., Texas)  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Dr. Clement Barone, a radiologist on the Upper
East Side, the final straw came when Blue Cross Blue Shield told
him it was cutting reimbursements for mammograms to $42 each. (He
charges $200.) He dropped the plan, and said he might stop
accepting all managed care soon.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barney Softness, a pediatrician on West End Avenue, said he
decided he could take no more when Oxford Health Plans suggested
that he cut costs by getting rid of the registered nurses in his
office. Instead, he told Oxford goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Byron Thomashow, a pulmonary specialist in Washington
Heights, recalled how he fought with one company for three hours to
get permission to do a procedure on a woman who was coughing up
life-threatening amounts of blood. He said the dispute underscored
why he no longer was in a managed care plan.
</P>
<P>
   While 92 percent of doctors in New York state accepted managed
care last year, it seems that a small rebellion is on. Fed up with
years of acrimonious relationships with managed care companies,
doctors, particularly those serving upper-middle-class patients,
are starting to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Many are dropping plans that have the lowest reimbursement
rates, biggest administrative headaches or represent the fewest
number of their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Others are washing their hands of the carriers, forcing patients
to pay up front and file claims the old-fashioned way, or pay the
fees themselves. Still others are looking for alternative ways to
negotiate with the companies, like forming group practices or other
professional associations that have more leverage to seek better
reimbursement rates. And hospitals are trying to fight back by
asking the New York state attorney general's office to look into
managed care company practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that a growing number of doctors are
disassociating themselves from managed care,'' said Dr. Charles
Aswad, executive vice president of the Medical Society of the State
of New York. Still more, he said, ``are being much more judicious
about looking at managed care contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is too early to quantify much of the activity, some
numbers are startling: 10 percent of the doctors affiliated with
New York Presbyterian Hospital have dropped out of managed care in
the last three months, and 50 percent have whittled the plans they
accept, said Dr. Myron Weisfeldt, chairman of the hospital's
department of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a tremendous number of physicians that to one degree
or another are beginning to separate themselves from managed care
at some financial risk to themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are signs that the movement extends past New York
City's borders: the Summit Medical Group, a 100-doctor practice in
Summit, N.J., for instance, recently dropped Blue Cross, and others
are expected to follow suit, said Dr. Greg Sachs, president of the
Medical Society of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors' opposition to managed care is on the increase
elsewhere, as well. In California, doctors have formed a group to
push their opposition, and in Texas, some are also forswearing
managed care. But experts say New York is particularly interesting
because doctors here are rejecting a system that is still quite new
and that rolled into the region at a breakneck speed in the last
few years. Chief among their complaints have been reduced fees and
more restrictions from the insurance companies on referrals and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``California had an evolution toward managed care, and we have
had a revolution,'' said Aswad. ``And that is why you hear about
these disruptions and large groups suddenly getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   This movement raises difficult questions about whether doctors
can and should expect to make the same good living they did before
the managed care movement, and whether a decision among some of the
brightest and best to drop managed care plans simply re-creates the
caste system of care that health maintenance organizations were
meant to eliminate by providing preventive care and a variety of
services.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, New York is not leaving the managed care business. The
HMO Trade Conference, a trade group, said it has not yet heard of
managed care companies worrying about a mass exodus.
</P>
<P>
   But it is just as clear that in the last few months many
doctors, who have been unhappy about managed care almost since its
introduction to the New York area, seem to be dropping out
entirely, for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, consolidation among the managed care companies
has increased, underscored by the announcement that Aetna U.S.
Healthcare _ whose tough bargaining on rates makes it one of the
least popular insurance carriers among doctors _ would acquire
Prudential Health Care. As the companies grow larger, their ability
to dictate rates and policies is likely to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Further, many companies have cut reimbursement rates
significantly in recent months, causing many doctors to conclude
that they cannot make any money by accepting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't stand it,'' said Thomashow, the pulmonary
specialist in Washington Heights. ``The thought of being put on
hold lines by people who don't know a quarter of what you are doing
to get permission for patients to go to the bathroom was
distasteful to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The revolt tends be led by doctors who have affluent patients
who are both demanding and willing to pay for the services if they
must. But some doctors, whose patient population is more diverse,
are trying to form groups to challenge the companies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Mount Kisco Medical Group in Mount Kisco, N.Y.,
has started to take advantage of its size _ 64 doctors under one
roof _ to negotiate with managed care companies. It has dropped
some plans that were demanding too much paperwork, said Dr. Scott
Hayworth, the group's chief executive officer. But it negotiated a
more favorable contract with others, including Oxford and Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are 64 doctors,'' Hayworth said, ``so we are lucky because
we have better negotiating power. Does that mean if you could wave
a magic wand and make managed care go away, would we? We would want
that for sure. But we make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict that more large groups will come together _
perhaps in the form of unions. But forming groups does not always
assure power.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1994 Dr. Jonas Goldstone and Dr. Saul Kaplan
formed Mid-Manhattan Medical Associates, an association of 26
doctors from various specialties who organized as a group to
arrange better ancillary services, like laboratories, and to deal
with managed care through a central business office.
</P>
<P>
   While many of their goals as a group have been met, they have
not won better reimbursement rates from insurance carriers, they
said. ``We are finding out that the projected income we expected in
dealing with managed care has not materialized,'' Goldstone said.
At this point, he added, ``A number of us are seriously considering
exiting managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone's doctor informs her he will no longer accept her
insurance plan, the options are clear: She finds another doctor or
she pays up. And if she is in a plan that partially reimburses for
visits to doctors out of the network, she files a claim.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, too, are bridling at managed care. The biggest
complaint is that companies are refusing to reimburse for the full
number of days that patients spend in the hospital, arguing that
certain illnesses can be treated in shorter stays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot overstate enough the sense of frustration within the
hospitals,'' said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York
Hospital Association, a trade group for local hospitals. ``We have
gone from tolerance to feverish pitch, and we are seeking help from
the authorities as well as lawmakers so HMOs stop abusing
hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   The association has asked the state attorney general's office to
pursue the matter of trimming days, and the association is
contemplating lawsuits against individual companies, Raske said.
</P>
<P>
   Most doctors say that quality of care, not their own earnings,
is driving their decisions. They argue, for instance, that when
managed care companies push for high-volume practices, it reduces
the time they can devote to each patient, teaching, reading medical
journals and working in clinics.
</P>
<P>
   They also recognize the painful reality that only middle-class
and wealthier patients are likely to have insurance plans that
allow them to choose their own doctor in exchange for a lower
reimbursement rate, typically 80 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a practice just for rich people,'' said Softness,
the pediatrician. ``That was never my plan. But I also want to be
able to give the kind of care that I think people deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   But some health care experts argue that a tiered health care
system is in the offing with a movement like this one. ``I think we
are moving toward a two-tiered or three-tiered structure of health
care,'' said Michael Lichman, senior vice president of Willis
Corroon of New York, one of the country's largest insurance
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Others, too, argue that despite a glut of doctors in the 1980s,
doctors' incomes rose higher than that of other professionals. They
contend that in a supply and demand economy, lower salaries would
have been expectable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If doctors say that quality will fall as reimbursements fall,
they are insulting themselves,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health
economist at Princeton University. ``The truth of the matter is
that when a group of laborers are in surplus, wages fall. They are
the only group that is unwilling to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who serve the poor, doctors fresh out of school who have
no established patient base, and doctors working in towns where one
employer dominates the market simply cannot refuse managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't drop HMOs if you have a family to feed and a dog who
depends on you,'' said Lichman. ``Patients have become used to
walking into a doctor's office and paying $10, and you can't say,
`OK, I'm back in the fee-for-service business.'''
</P>
<P>
   But as long as employers continue to offer plans that give
employees a chance to go to doctors outside their networks _ which
is likely in a strong economy _ and HMOs continue to push for
doctors to cut costs, more are likely to leave the HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear every day about other groups of doctors who are
dropping managed care,'' said Dr. Barry Chaiken, who founded the
Association of Independent Physicians in New York, a new and
growing group of doctors free of managed care. ``As managed care
comes in and insists on fee discounts of 30 percent or more,
physicians have to change their practices to survive.''

   President Richard M. Nixon went to China. Henry A. Kissinger
came along. They talked with Chairman Mao Tse-tung and his aides of
war, peace, sex, death and the incendiary powers of the potent rice
liquor known as mao tai.
</P>
<P>
   When Kissinger stepped down as secretary of state in 1977, he
took reams of documents and sought to seal them until after his
death. But the National Security Archive, a research group in
Washington, tracked down records of his talks in the 1970s with
Chinese and Soviet leaders like Mao and Leonid Brezhnev in pursuit
of diplomacy and detente. They will be published this month as
``The Kissinger Transcripts'' (The New Press).
</P>
<P>
   Here is the first thaw of the Cold War _ the old-time communists
chatting amiably and talking tough with the Americans. In these
talks of a quarter-century past, there are resonances with the
present _ presidential scandal, Chinese spying and Russian
intrigues. There are also touching moments as the Americans try to
cozy up to the cantankerous Brezhnev and the chilly mountain of the
dying Mao.

   Feb. 21, 1972, Mao's residence: The first ice-breaking meeting
between Nixon and Mao, arranged through Kissinger's secret
negotiations. Mao wants to talk philosophy, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon: I have read the chairman's poems and speeches, and I knew
he was a professional philosopher. (The Chinese laugh.)
</P>
<P>
   Mao (looking at Kissinger): He is a doctor of philosophy?
</P>
<P>
   Nixon: He is a doctor of brains.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: What about asking him to be the main speaker today?
</P>
<P>
   Nixon: He is an expert in philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: I used to assign the chairman's collective writings
to my classes at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: Those writings of mine aren't anything. There is nothing
instructive in what I wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon: The chairman's writings moved a nation and have changed
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: I haven't been able to change it. I've only been able to
change a few places in the vicinity of Beijing. . . . We two must
not monopolize the whole show. It won't do if we don't let
Kissinger have a say. You have been famous about your trips to
China.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: It was the president who set the direction. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Nixon: He is a very wise assistant to say it that way. (Mao
laughs).
</P>
<P>
   Mao: He is praising you, saying you are clever.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon: He doesn't look like a secret agent. He is the only man
in captivity who could go to Paris 12 times and Peking once and no
one knew it except possibly a couple of pretty girls. (Prime
Minister Chou En-lai laughs.) . . . Anyone who uses pretty girls as
a cover must be the greatest diplomat of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Mao (who had had many concubines): So your girls are very often
made use of?
</P>
<P>
   Nixon: His girls, not mine. It would get me into great trouble
if I used girls as a cover.
</P>
<P>
   Chou (laughing): Especially during elections.

<P>
   Feb. 17-18, 1973, Mao's residence: A midnight meeting. Mao,
fading in and out of logical discourse, talks about spies, war and
heaven. The Briton he refers to is the World War II field marshal
General Bernard Law Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: I don't look bad, but God has sent me an invitation.
</P>
<P>
   There was someone in the British army who was opposed to the
independence of your country. . . . He probably doesn't oppose you
anymore. At that time, you also opposed us. We also opposed you. So
we are two enemies (laughter).
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: Two former enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: Now we call the relationship between ourselves a
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: That's our sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: That's what I am saying. . . . But let us not speak false
words or engage in trickery. We don't steal your documents. You can
deliberately leave them somewhere and try us out. Nor do we engage
in eavesdropping and bugging. There is no use in those small
tricks. And some of the big maneuverings, there is no use to them,
too. . . . Your CIA is not good for major events.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: That's absolutely true. That's been our experience.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: You want information on a certain question, then the
intelligence reports come in as so many snowflakes. We also have
our intelligence service and it is the same with them. (Chou
laughs.)
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Later, Mao wonders if Washington wants Moscow to attack China.
The Chinese, like the Americans, were worried that the Soviets
might launch a war for world domination.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: If there are Russians planning to attack China . . .
perhaps you can begin to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: Mr. Chairman, it is really very important that we
understand each other's motives. We will never knowingly cooperate
in an attack on China.
</P>
<P>
   Mao (interrupting): No, that's not so. Your aim in doing that
would be to bring the Soviet Union down.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: That's a very dangerous thing. (Laughter.)
</P>
<P>
   Mao: The goal of the Soviet Union is to occupy both Europe and
Asia, the two continents.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: We want to discourage a Soviet attack, not defeat it.
We want to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: As for things, matters, in the world, it is hard to say. .

invitation.

   Mao: If there are Russians planning to attack China . . .
perhaps you can begin to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: Mr. Chairman, it is really very important that we
understand each other's motives. We will never knowingly cooperate
in an attack on China.
</P>
<P>
   Mao (interrupting): No, that's not so. Your aim in doing that
would be to bring the Soviet Union down.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: That's a very dangerous thing. (Laughter.)
</P>
<P>
   Mao: The goal of the Soviet Union is to occupy both Europe and
Asia, the two continents.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: We want to discourage a Soviet attack, not defeat it.
We want to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: As for things, matters, in the world, it is hard to say. .
. . I'm not afraid of anything. Anyway, God has sent me an
invitation.

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Put the Khmer Rouge on trial for mass
murder? ``Who's going to try them?'' asked a foreign human rights
worker. ``They killed all the lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only lawyers but doctors, teachers, engineers, accountants,
clerks, businessmen, monks, artists _ anybody who stood in their
way as they dragged Cambodia backward from the modern age toward
their goal: a bizarre, primitive agrarian utopia.
</P>
<P>
   The principal tactic was to eliminate _ not by re-educating but
by killing _ the entire class of people who could be called modern.
In that, if in nothing else, the Khmer Rouge seems to have
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 20 years later, as Cambodia still struggles to get back
onto its feet, the country faces a harsh fact that sets its
suffering apart, even from the atrocities of Hitler, Stalin and the
like: The Khmer Rouge not only destroyed Cambodia's culture,
commerce and civil society in the 1970s; it eliminated the people
who might have been available to rebuild them.
</P>
<P>
   In December, two top Khmer Rouge leaders _ Khieu Samphan and
Nuon Chea _ surrendered to the government, apparently in return for
a free pass to settle into a comfortable retirement. But foreign
countries and many Cambodians are pressing hard for a tribunal to
try them for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million people died of malnutrition, overwork,
misdiagnosed disease and execution when the Khmer Rouge were in
power from 1975 to 1979. Many of those targeted for killing came
from the educated class. Of 545 judges in the country in 1975, said
Belgian historian Raoul Jennar, all but four died. Of approximately
800 doctors, only about 40 survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Khmer Rouge time there were entire professions which
disappeared,'' Jennar said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1980s, there was nobody in Cambodia who knew how
to use a computer, he said. No one knew how to run an electric
power plant. The country's power stations, built by the French in
the 1930s, had to be repaired by Soviet engineers.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers have hardly risen in the two decades since the
Khmer Rouge were driven from power by a Vietnamese invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1980s Cambodia was under the control of a
Vietnamese-backed Communist government that was shunned by most of
the outside world, and it was preoccupied by a civil war. Most of
the intellectuals who survived joined an exodus of as many as
400,000 refugees, and the country's ruined education system could
not begin to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back to Cambodia in 1992, we visited the prison
and we found out that very few prisoners had had trials, and those
trials were conducted without lawyers,'' said Kek Galabru, who
founded the country's leading human rights group, Licadho, when she
returned from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have about 200 lawyers in the nation, but the
quality is not good,'' she said. ``The problem is quality. Even in
human rights work we have to train our staff _ train, train,
train.''
</P>
<P>
   The task of training is monumental in a country that never had a
high literacy rate and now has one of the world's lowest, about 35
percent. Even today, as many as half the country's high school
teachers have only an elementary school diploma, and one in 20 does
not even have that, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the warfare and killings of the 1960s and 1970s,
Cambodia was an unsophisticated, poorly educated farming nation,
fought over through the centuries by its neighbors, Vietnam and
Thailand, and treated as an afterthought by its colonial masters,
the French.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the devastation of the Khmer Rouge years, assuring
that Cambodia would take no part in the economic boom that would
transform much of Southeast Asia after the end of the Indochina
wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think people are still underestimating the legacy of the
'70s and the '80s,'' Jennar said. ``In the '70s, 95 percent of the
human resources disappeared. And the legacy of the '80s is the
impossibility to stop to train new human resources. So when we
speak of the rule of law, we must keep in mind that Cambodia was
able to reopen its faculty of law only in 1992. It is very
difficult to make the rule of law work when you do not have
jurists.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the absence of skilled practitioners of law or medicine
or administration, said American historian David P. Chandler,
Cambodian society suffers from a more generalized malaise as a
result of the brutalization of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just sort of traumatized,'' Chandler said. ``Even if
they had a bourgeois background, these people are still stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the country's continuing political feuds and violence,
which also have their roots in the struggles of the Khmer Rouge
years, these stunned Cambodians have not had the peace and
stability that would allow them at least to rest and recover.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the country were simply to open a dialogue about the
past, Chandler had doubts about what could be accomplished. ``I
don't see the people in Cambodia who are capable of picking up the
ball in a debate like this,'' he said. ``I don't see the people who
have the education, who know how to do a trial, who know what
evidence means, who know what corroboration means.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the nation's catastrophe are visible even in Long
Beach, Calif., a center for Cambodian immigrants who fled the Khmer
Rouge killings, carrying their traumas with them, Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cambodians are the worst group in every category except
arrests,'' he said, referring to a recent study. ``The worst
literacy, the lowest voting record, the lowest income, the highest
infant mortality. In arrests they are fourth or fifth up from the
bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not only the absence of lawyers but the absence of an
educated class that holds back Cambodia's development into a civil
society. Without a middle class, the nation lacks the public
pressure to hold its leaders accountable and to demand basic
rights.
</P>
<P>
   This is a nation with a history of arbitrary rule, where the
elite govern for themselves, not for the population at large, and
where the word for ``govern'' is the same as the word for
``consume.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have educated people, it is more and more difficult
to impose an arbitrary system,'' Jennar said. ``I do think this is
the key, the key issue. I think it is impossible to make steps on
democracy-building or on fighting corruption or improving the
national administration without an educated class.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cambodia's trauma _ the legacy of the Khmer Rouge _ goes
beyond this, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not only people with skills who disappeared,'' Jennar
said. ``There was also the destruction of the social fabric, the
destruction of the society and I must say the destruction of the
Khmer soul. This is still a broken society. It will take
generations to heal.''

society. Without a middle class, the nation lacks the public
pressure to hold its leaders accountable and to demand basic
rights.
</P>
<P>
   This is a nation with a history of arbitrary rule, where the
elite govern for themselves, not for the population at large, and
where the word for ``govern'' is the same as the word for
``consume.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have educated people, it is more and more difficult
to impose an arbitrary system,'' Jennar said. ``I do think this is
the key, the key issue. I think it is impossible to make steps on
democracy-building or on fighting corruption or improving the
national administration without an educated class.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cambodia's trauma _ the legacy of the Khmer Rouge _ goes
beyond this, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not only people with skills who disappeared,'' Jennar
said. ``There was also the destruction of the social fabric, the
destruction of the society and I must say the destruction of the
Khmer soul. This is still a broken society. It will take
generations to heal.''

NFL NOTES AND NEWS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this season, a Jets defensive player went into a small
room at the team's Hempstead, N.Y., practice facility and was
stunned by what he saw. Inside was a bank of video screens, he
said, showing various parts of the complex. On one screen, to the
player's surprise, was a view of the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things around here have knocked me for a loop, but
this is one of the biggest,'' said the defensive starter, who asked
not to be identified for fear of repercussions. ``My first thought
was, `Has the team been spying on us?'''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Jets denied that the team uses video cameras
for surveillance purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Several agents said their clients on the Jets were aware of the
video cameras and believed they were set up this year after several
locker-room thefts at the complex.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unclear exactly how many teams use hidden cameras in
their complexes, interviews with players, agents and union leaders
suggested that several clubs use them and that the number of teams
that do is increasing. Gene Upshaw, executive director of the
players association, said he believed that at least 25 percent of
National Football League teams use cameras in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were interviewed said they believed the reasons for
using the hidden cameras varied from a desire to provide better
security for the players, to watching and learning as much about
them as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A number of players, team executives and union officials believe
putting hidden cameras in the locker room, the training room or
other parts of the workplace is a good idea. Others believe that
cameras are a violation of a player's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of facilities have surveillance equipment
throughout the complex and in the locker room,'' Upshaw said. ``I
believe this and I've been told this by some teams. But the
equipment is there for security, not so much for surveillance. I
don't think most players are aware of it and I know it's like Linda
Tripp, but if a player follows the rules, he has nothing to worry
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in Denver, in a meeting with the players at the
Broncos' facility, you see certain things in the room and know
they're not lights. I know management is listening. When I'm in
Cincinnati, I know Owner Mike Brown is listening. I don't want to
say how I know, but I know. But when it comes to this issue of
cameras around the players, it's not a big deal to me, because they
are there for the security of our players, and obviously the safety
of the players is a primary concern for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Upshaw added, ``I'd rather err on the side of caution, than have
some nut come into the locker room and do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos and Bengals denied ever eavesdropping on Upshaw
during union meetings with players.
</P>
<P>
   Art Modell, the Baltimore Ravens' owner, said: ``Some teams are
using surveillance equipment in the locker room, yes. But I'd fire
the first guy who did that here. No video cameras, no audiotapes,
no eavesdropping.''
</P>
<P>
   Most players do not know they are being taped, and teams even
keep the fact that they use this equipment from the league office,
team officials have said. There are no NFL rules against
videotaping players in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Erosion of privacy has long been of concern for workers in other
industries. Now, it is slowly becoming an issue in professional
football as well. More teams are using high-tech devices, such as
tiny video cameras not much larger than a quarter, and hiding them
in their complexes, those interviewed for this article said.
</P>
<P>
   Some players said they agreed that video surveillance in the
locker room provided more security, but they raised questions about
abuse. Are teams watching private conversations players are having
with teammates or reporters? And with sophisticated new cameras
available, what's next, hidden microphones?
</P>
<P>
   Video cameras have been part of football for years. The San
Francisco 49ers in the 1980s were among the first to tape team
meetings, so a player who was ill and missed one could be given the
tape and not fall behind. Teams now routinely tape practices _ even
warm-ups. That way, teams can go to the videotape to verify or
debunk a compensation claim filed by a player who says he was
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the use of the camera is entering the locker room, which
may prove to be more controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Upshaw cited a remarkable example of how one team used videotape
from the locker room. A certain player, he said, recently filed a
grievance against a team (Upshaw would not identify the player or
the team). The core of the grievance came down to where the player
was at a particular time. The player said he was not at the team's
facility; the team said he was.
</P>
<P>
   To back its claim, the team used videotape of the player in the
locker room taken at the very time he maintained he was not there,
Upshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, NFL teams are catching up to other employers. A
1997 survey of 900 midsize and large companies by the American
Management Association found that nearly two-thirds of the
companies surveyed videotaped their workers on the job.
</P>
<P>
   If a player did not like being videotaped in the locker room,
could he sue his team? Short of videotaping bathroom stalls, little
prevents a team from secretly recording the locker room or any
other part of the team's facility. The sole federal law that limits
monitoring by an employer comes from the 1986 Electronic
Communications Privacy Act, and it prohibits eavesdropping on
personal conversations. Companies, however, can monitor all
nonspoken personal communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sensitive issue,'' Upshaw said. ``I'm sure it will
be talked about a lot in the future.''

<P>
   ASTANA, Kazakhstan _ The government has tried almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   It has supplied heat to most homes and offices in the new
national capital of this Central Asian nation, taking the sting out
of temperatures now at 10 below zero. It has revved up drab Astana
with brightly decorated buildings and restaurants and a delightful
playground of ice sculptures and slides that lights up at night.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a year after Astana's showy debut, many bureaucrats are
miserable. An anticipated corps of foreign diplomats and business
people has simply not shown up, with conspicuous exceptions like
the occupants of a smart red storefront on Astana's wide main
avenue. They work for Saudi Binladen Group, the contracting company
that is creating Astana's master plan. It is run by the estranged
family of the terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather is fine for us,'' said Ashraf Khallad, a Binladen
manager, who had snow piled up outside his office window. ``We work
here. The apartment is upstairs. And, when we need to go somewhere,
the car is just outside.''
</P>
<P>
   When President Nursultan Nazarbayev unveiled his plans for this
city of 300,000 people on the Siberian steppe, he stubbornly
rejected objections that the move from the old capital of Almaty
was unnecessary, unpopular and, considering the cost in an oil-rich
but still cash-poor nation, even imprudent.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the autocratic Nazarbayev is seeking re-election to a
new seven-year term; he is expected to win easily. But the
prognosis for his dreamchild, Kazakhstan's new capital, is in
doubt. After some $1 billion in spending, officials are starting to
voice the previously unspeakable: Further plans for Astana must be
curtailed, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not that Astana is situated on a mosquito-ridden
swamp and that in winter, said a Foreign Ministry official who
requested anonymity, it ``is tolerable only when the wind isn't
blowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it is that the global economic slump has finally reached
Kazakhstan. After two years of expansion, experts say, Kazakhstan's
economy shrank last year and will probably contract further in
1999. A plunge in world oil prices has cut state income by a third,
producing budget deficits that, if not somehow reduced, ``over the
long term are going to become a crushing burden,'' said Stephen
Lewarne, who runs the Almaty office of Global Securities.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are examining a drastic reduction in 1999
spending on Astana _ to $25 million from $100 million, say Western
diplomats. Foreign investment in the new capital is unlikely to
meet government projections of $300 million this year, said a
senior Kazakh official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that although a few projects will begin in Astana
``because it is high on the president's political agenda,'' the
official said, the new city center that Nazarbayev envisions on the
left bank of the Irtysh River will probably remain in the planning
stages.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Few residents of this republic of 15.5 million, the
second-largest in the former Soviet Union, are likely to be
troubled. And the thousands of foreign business people who have
taken up residence because of an expected oil boom clearly prefer
Almaty, 750 miles south, with its nearby skiing, and plentiful bars
and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Of more than two dozen foreign countries with embassies in
Kazakhstan, just one, Uzbekistan, has begun building a permanent
mission in Astana, a city official said.
</P>
<P>
   For disgruntled government officials, the suspension of
construction comes too late _ their ministries have already
permanently shifted here, and quality of life has declined.
</P>
<P>
   The one consolation is financial. On the edge of Astana are
1,000 colorful apartments, which several government officials said
had been sold to them for $7,000 to $8,000 each. If an official
stays in Astana for three years, he or she is entitled to sell the
apartment at the going market price, which some estimate as high as
$50,000, and keep the profit.
</P>
<P>
   When Nazarbayev chose the new capital's site, he also changed
its name. At its founding as a Cossack fortress in 1832, this spot
was called Akmola, or White Grave in Kazakh. After much snickering,
Nazarbayev selected its current name, which means simply
``capital.''

TRIAL ACCORD SHIFTS FOCUS BACK TO STARR'S EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH-HYDE, IMPEACH-DEFENSE) 
(JT) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's agreement on how to conduct the
initial phase of President Clinton's impeachment trial sent House
prosecutors and the president's lawyers diving this weekend back
into the voluminous evidence collected by Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In the 7,000 pages of grand jury testimony and boxes of
supplementary evidence, Rep. Henry Hyde, the leader of the House
prosecution team, sees a clear and convincing picture of perjury
and obstruction of justice so grave that Clinton should be removed
from office.
</P>
<P>
   From that same pile of evidence, the president's legal team is
putting together a more aggressive defense than the one they
presented unsuccessfully to the House _ one they now say should
lead to the president's acquittal. The White House agreed to accept
the record of testimony amassed by the independent counsel,
although the president's lawyers profoundly disagree with Starr and
Hyde about what the evidence shows.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers will argue that instead of proving that
Clinton lied or obstructed justice, the evidence shows only that
Clinton tried to conceal the embarrassing details of an improper
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, according to interviews and
legal documents they have prepared for the Senate trial. Though the
president's actions and behavior were ``reprehensible,'' Charles
Ruff, the White House counsel, has said, they were not unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's Republicans and Democrats spent this week sparring
over whether to call witnesses, virtually all of whom have already
testified under oath before Starr's grand jury. On Friday, the
senators agreed to defer until late January a decision on whether
to summon witnesses _ and if so, which ones.
</P>
<P>
   That decision will dramatically affect the length and tenor of
the trial. And perhaps more important, both the president's
prosecutors and his defenders can point to many of the same
witnesses and testimony as buttressing their respective cases.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment proceedings in the House involved legal jousting
over the constitutional standards for high crimes and misdemeanors.
Although those arguments will be heard again in the Senate, the
House prosecutors and White House lawyers are preparing to lock
horns directly on the factual details of the case. In those
details, each side sees a starkly different picture.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the prosecution team wants to call Betty Currie,
the president's secretary, and Vernon E. Jordan Jr., a Washington
lawyer and presidential confidant, to question them, respectively,
about gifts and job help Ms. Lewinsky received from the president.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the impeachment article charging the president with
obstruction of justice are accusations that Clinton schemed with
Ms. Lewinsky to hide gifts sought in the Paula Jones lawsuit
against the president, and that efforts by Jordan to help Ms.
Lewinsky find a job were intended to buy her silence in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   But the testimony of Ms. Currie and Jordan before the grand jury
also forms the cornerstone of Clinton's defense against
obstruction. Ms. Currie testified that it was Ms. Lewinsky who
asked her to retrieve the gifts, and Jordan said there was no quid
pro quo between his help in finding Ms. Lewinsky a job and her
affidavit in the Jones case denying a sexual relationship with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of Ms. Lewinsky also cuts both ways. She testified
that the president engaged in sexual activity with her that fell
within the narrow definition of sexual relations in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   That pits her word against the president's denial before the
grand jury on Aug. 17 that he had lied in his civil deposition in
the Jones case. In the Jones deposition, he said he had not engaged
in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. The president's insistence
that his testimony in the Jones case was not perjurious is another
charge outlined in the impeachment article.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Lewinsky also testified that no one asked her to lie and
that she was not offered help finding a job to secure her silence
in the Jones case. That testimony undercuts the heart of the
obstruction of justice case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not witnesses are called, the prosecution and the
defense will highlight selected portions of the testimony of
crucial figures like Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie and Jordan for their
own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   That is all the more certain given that much of the case against
the president is circumstantial and turns on subjective views of
his intentions and interactions with Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie,
Jordan, other White House aides and his lawyers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most difficult charges for the president to rebut
are contained in the article of impeachment charging him with lying
before the grand jury about the nature and details of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Lewinsky testified in detail
about 11 sexual encounters with the president. That testimony is
perhaps the most problematic evidence confronting the president's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Because Clinton told the grand jury that he did not have sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky as defined in the Jones case, the
evidence on this point boils down to his word against hers.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team must decide whether to try to
undermine Ms. Lewinsky's credibility with other evidence. Among
that evidence is the testimony of witnesses and friends of Ms.
Lewinsky's who said that Ms. Lewinsky told them things that may
have been untrue, like the Secret Service took the president to Ms.
Lewinsky's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the president's lawyers paint Ms. Lewinsky as a
liar, their ability to use her testimony to support other aspects
of their case, particularly on obstruction of justice, could be
hindered.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution team will try to broaden its perjury case by
charging that the president lied about other details, like when his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky began, the frequency of their
meetings and the number of times they had sexually explicit
telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team will emphasize that Clinton admitted
to an ``inappropriate, intimate'' relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
before the grand jury. They will argue that differences between the
president's and Ms. Lewinsky's descriptions of the number and
specific details of their sexual encounters are not significant
enough to support a perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the president has testified that he thought the
sexual activity in which he engaged with Ms. Lewinsky fell outside
the definition of sexual relations in the Jones case. However, this
argument has provoked criticisms that the president and his lawyers
are engaged in tortured legal hair-splitting.
</P>
<P>
   The perjury article of impeachment also charges the president
with lying when he told the grand jury that he did not lie in the
Jones case and with letting his lawyer in the Jones case, Robert S.
Bennett, falsely deny that the president and Ms. Lewinsky were
sexually involved. It also accuses the president of lying to his
aides about his dealings with Ms. Lewinsky. The charges involving
Bennett and the aides are repackaged in the second article of
impeachment involving obstruction of justice, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team thinks these allegations are more
easily rebutted. They will argue that he thought he was being
technically truthful, even if he was misleading, during the Jones
deposition. Hardly intending to lie to his aides in order to
influence their future testimony, the president's defenders will
explain, he was trying to conceal from his friends and family an
improper relationship about which he was deeply embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   The article of impeachment charging obstruction of justice turns
on the belief of both Starr and the House prosecutors that the
president wanted Ms. Lewinsky to testify falsely in the Jones case
and that he also sought to influence other potential witnesses,
like Ms. Currie, his aides and his lawyer, Bennett, to give false
accounts of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. In return for her
false testimony, Ms. Lewinsky was to be rewarded with help finding
a job.
</P>
<P>
   In the perjury case, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is at odds with
crucial aspects of the president's account. In the obstruction
case, the prosecutors must make a circumstantial but highly
suggestive set of facts support a sweeping accusation. None of the
witnesses involved in the events, including Ms. Lewinsky, Ms.
Currie and Jordan, has testified that the president asked them to
lie, schemed to hide evidence or tried to enlist help to keep Ms.
Lewinsky quiet.
</P>
<P>
   In both the Starr referral and the final House impeachment
report, great weight is given to gifts that the President gave Ms.
Lewinsky that she later turned over to Ms. Currie. The gifts were
subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee concluded that Ms. Currie would
not have retrieved the gifts unless asked to do so by the
president.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ms. Currie testified that Ms. Lewinsky asked her to
collect the gifts, and the president has denied asking Ms. Currie
to retrieve them.
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis of her testimony by the president's
lawyers, Ms. Lewinsky has given 10 different accounts of her
conversations with the president about the gifts. In none of those
conversations, they will argue, did the president instruct Ms.
Lewinsky to conceal the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Currie also testified that she felt no pressure or
intimidation from the president, who is accused of trying to
influence her testimony, and she was not a witness in any
proceeding when the president talked to her about Ms. Lewinsky.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some now-familiar faces will be presenting some
now-familiar arguments on the Senate floor to defend President
Clinton as he goes on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Though White House aides say they are still mapping out their
strategy, the core of the defense team and of its case are settled.
The team is to be led by Charles Ruff, the former Watergate special
prosecutor who is Clinton's fifth White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff anchored the president's defense before the House Judiciary
Committee a month ago. The White House was very pleased with his
sardonic, at times theatrical, dissection of the case presented by
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was not terribly effective but the White House
attributes that, in part, to the news media. The Republicans
released the text of their proposed articles of impeachment
immediately after Ruff's appearance, overwhelming news of his
presentation on television and in some newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom is that we never argued the facts or
the evidence, and the conventional wisdom is wrong,'' said Joe
Lockhart, the White House press secretary. ``We argued them
forcefully and in a compelling way, but it was drowned out by the
release of the draft articles.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' chief immediate goal is to present such a
convincing argument over the 24 hours available to them that a
majority of senators will vote to dismiss the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they hope for a quick resolution, the president's
lawyers are preparing for an extended trial with witnesses called
and new evidence admitted. Such a trial could last months, some
aides fear, and obliterate Clinton's hopes for a history-making
overhaul of the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing along with Ruff in the Senate will be Gregory Craig,
the White House special counsel hired by Clinton to help manage his
impeachment defense. A relative newcomer to the team, Craig still
does not have the detailed knowledge that his colleagues have of
the case, White House aides say. But as a former aide to Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., he has close ties to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Craig led off the president's defense before the House Judiciary
Committee and has functioned as the official spokesman for the
legal team.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being an experienced criminal lawyer, Craig comes
off well on television, the White House believes, and he carries
none of the political baggage of some of the longer-serving members
of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff and Craig are backed up by numerous lawyers, both in
private practice and in the White House. Two among them _ David
Kendall, the president's longtime private lawyer, and Lanny Breuer,
a member of the counsel's office _ are likely to play significant
roles during the trial, White House advisers say.
</P>
<P>
   In public, Kendall has taken a lower-profile role since his
efforts to defend Clinton on television last year were panned as
hairsplitting even at the White House. He sat silently behind Craig
and Ruff as they defended the president in the House. But he
remains the foremost expert on Clinton's legal travails, White
House aides say, and he is trusted by both the president and his
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer has been at the center of the president's damage-control
operation since last January. He has operated mostly out of sight,
processing subpoenas, gathering documents and contacting witnesses.
But he came to the attention of Starr, who subpoenaed him to
testify last year. The president tried but failed to invoke
attorney-client privilege to block his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare moment before reporters as he left the courthouse
after testifying, Breuer offered only two words when asked his
reaction to the hubbub surrounding his appearance: ``I'm honored.''

<P>
   As state legislatures nationwide start new sessions, lawmakers
are beginning to debate how to spend their biggest windfall in
recent years: tens of billions of dollars from tobacco settlement
deals.
</P>
<P>
   While some elected officials are calling for the money to be
spent on health care initiatives and anti-smoking campaigns, others
are urging that it be used on projects unrelated to tobacco,
including new schools or jails, and even sidewalk repair. Still
other lawmakers say the tobacco windfall should be used to
eliminate state debts or be given to taxpayers as rebates.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 25 years, all 50 states and some cities will
receive almost $246 billion from cigarette producers as a result of
the lawsuits brought against the tobacco industry to recover
Medicaid money spent treating smoking-related illnesses. But while
public officials unified those actions under the theme of reducing
the ranks of underage smokers, the question of how to spend
settlement dollars has taken on a fractured look that reflects the
financial and political peculiarities of each locality.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in Alabama have earmarked $85 million, the first
installment of its tobacco payout, for a variety of youth-related
programs, including the building of boot camp-style detention
centers, and will spend only $500,000 of that sum on anti-smoking
efforts. Gov. Jane Hull of Arizona has proposed using her state's
share to finance programs discouraging tobacco use and to rebuild
health facilities, including a psychiatric hospital. And Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan wants to use the city's share to meet
a federal requirement that sidewalks be more accessible to the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Because most legislatures will treat the tobacco payments like
any other revenue, interest groups ranging from anti-smoking
advocates to business associations to tobacco farmers are gearing
up to lobby lawmakers on how to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it is a free-for-all,'' said Dr. David Kessler,
former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. ``It is a
fight over money.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, only the four states _ Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi
and Texas _ that resolved their lawsuits before the recent $206
billion tobacco settlement have received the first installments of
their payments, which together will total $40 billion over 25
years. The other states expect to get their first payments next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The money that the states will receive varies widely. California
and New York, the two largest states, will receive $25 billion each
over 25 years, and sparsely populated states like Alaska and Idaho
less than $1 billion each. It is still unclear how much of that
money the states will be allowed to keep because the federal
government, which contributes to each state's Medicaid bill, wants
its share, as well.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have said they plan to fight any federal move to
recoup money or put conditions on its use. But Arturo Perez, a
policy research specialist with the National Conference of State
Legislatures in Denver, said that the prospect of federal action
had caused some states to move cautiously because they do not know
how much tobacco money they will have to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Many state legislatures are expected to put the tobacco
settlement issue high on their agendas. Perez estimated that for
most states the tobacco settlement windfall would be a sum
equivalent to 1.5 percent of revenues in 1997, the most recent year
for which data are available. That figure is equal to the amount
most states collected that year in tobacco excise taxes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies have already passed along the cost of the
settlement to smokers by raising prices. It is expected that all
states will use at least a part of their settlement windfall to
finance anti-tobacco measures like programs to encourage smokers to
quit and advertising campaigns to reduce the number of young people
who smoke and to step up efforts to prevent retailers from selling
cigarettes to underage buyers.
</P>
<P>
   But the states are free to do with money as they choose. And as
a result, proposals have reflected not only each state's financial
condition but local political and spending demands, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska, for example, has created a tobacco settlement trust
fund and will use interest from it to underwrite measures like
converting nursing homes to assisted-living facilities. On the
other end of the financial spectrum, Gov. Mike Foster of Louisiana
has proposed raising cash to pay off the state's debt by selling
off its tobacco settlement to the highest bidder. A spokesman for
Foster said the state could then use the $300 million it is now
paying in interest to finance raises for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   A number of tobacco-growing states, like North Carolina and
Kentucky, are likely to use part of their settlements to help
tobacco farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Gov. George Pataki has not taken a position on the
issue. Democratic legislative leaders are urging that tobacco money
be used to cover health coverage for the uninsured, while
Republicans are calling for a lowering of property taxes and a
paying down of state debt.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, which will get $7.6 billion, Gov. Christine Todd
Whitman has called for increased spending on anti-smoking efforts
and public health programs, including charity care, which pays
hospital bills for the uninsured. And in Connecticut, which will
get $3.7 billion, legislative leaders have only just begun
discussions about how to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, dean of the Yale University Medical School, said that
without significant reductions in smoking, the settlement would
prove worthless because the costs of treating tobacco-related
illnesses would not decrease. And anti-smoking groups are lobbying
lawmakers to spend significant amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Myers, a lawyer with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,
an advocacy group in Washington, said that his group believes that
each state, depending on the scope of current anti-smoking
programs, needed to earmark 25 percent to 45 percent of settlement
proceeds to mount an effective effort.
</P>
<P>
   Some states are expected to spend sizable sums on anti-tobacco
initiatives, but the prospects that such spending will occur
nationwide may prove unlikely.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, even in Minnesota, which won the highest settlement
on a per-capita basis from cigarette makers, spending on
anti-smoking measures is likely to fall far below initial
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the $6.1 billion settlement reached last year between
tobacco producers and Minnesota, $202 million, or 3 percent of the
proceeds, was set aside to finance programs over the next decade to
help smokers quit and also to support research on ways to reduce
underage smoking. The settlement also recommended that an added
$650 million be put into an endowment to finance added tobacco
prevention campaigns, a move backed by Hubert Humphrey 3rd, the
state attorney general who brought the suit against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Humphrey lost his bid to become governor to Jesse Ventura,
the Reform Party candidate. And now with Humphrey out of office
local anti-smoking groups find themselves without an important ally
just as lawmakers begin to discuss how to spend the tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Minnesota Smoke-Free Coalition has begun to
run newspaper and radio advertisements urging the state's lawmakers
to add the $650 million to anti-tobacco programs, said Judy Knapp,
the group's executive director. And Dr. Richard Hurt, director of
the nicotine dependence programs at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., said the additional money was essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money right now is not enough to mount an aggressive
marketing campaign'' against tobacco use, said Hurt, who is also
chairman of Minnesota Partnership for Action Against Tobacco, a
foundation created by the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But such a move is facing opposition from business groups like
the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce. That group has said that it
thinks that spending $202 million on tobacco programs is plenty for
now and that settlement dollars should be used to reduce health
insurance taxes paid by companies and others.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ventura, who has suggested using tobacco money to
create an endowment that will finance medical research, does not
plan to advocate added spending on anti-tobacco measures beyond the
$202 million already earmarked, said Teresa McFarland, a
spokeswoman for his office.
</P>
<P>
   Most states will not decide how to spend their windfalls until
the end of the current legislative sessions. But in recent decades,
state legislatures have often used windfalls for purposes unrelated
to the circumstances that produced them.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Hovey, the editor of the State Budget and Tax News, a
newsletter, said that in the early 1990s many states were able to
use federal, rather than state, money to pay for Medicaid services.
But rather than spending the money on added health-care service, it
was used by lawmakers to plug budget gaps and avoid politically
damaging tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   Hovey, who was previously a state budget director in Illinois
and Ohio, said that in discussing the tobacco money with state
officials, he had been advocating a go-slow approach. He said that
unresolved claims on tobacco money by cities and hospitals might
slow down payments, and that if the federal government recouped a
share, state revenues would shrink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have expressed the view,'' Hovey said, ``that in substance
you should not count on this money until you can run your fingers
through it.''  &QL;

ANGRY AT MANAGED CARE, DOCTORS START FIGHTING BACK

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Dr. Clement Barone, a radiologist on the Upper
East Side, the final straw came when Blue Cross Blue Shield told
him it was cutting reimbursements for mammograms to $42 each. (He
charges $200.) He dropped the plan, and said he might stop
accepting all managed care soon.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barney Softness, a pediatrician on West End Avenue, said he
decided he could take no more when Oxford Health Plans suggested
that he cut costs by getting rid of the registered nurses in his
office. Instead, he told Oxford goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Byron Thomashow, a pulmonary specialist in Washington
Heights, recalled how he fought with one company for three hours to
get permission to do a procedure on a woman who was coughing up
life-threatening amounts of blood. He said the dispute underscored
why he no longer was in a managed care plan.
</P>
<P>
   While 92 percent of doctors in New York state accepted managed
care last year, it seems that a small rebellion is on. Fed up with
years of acrimonious relationships with managed care companies,
doctors, particularly those serving upper-middle-class patients,
are starting to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Many are dropping plans that have the lowest reimbursement
rates, biggest administrative headaches or represent the fewest
number of their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Others are washing their hands of the carriers, forcing patients
to pay up front and file claims the old-fashioned way, or pay the
fees themselves. Still others are looking for alternative ways to
negotiate with the companies, like forming group practices or other
professional associations that have more leverage to seek better
reimbursement rates. And hospitals are trying to fight back by
asking the New York state attorney general's office to look into
managed care company practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that a growing number of doctors are
disassociating themselves from managed care,'' said Dr. Charles
Aswad, executive vice president of the Medical Society of the State
of New York. Still more, he said, ``are being much more judicious
about looking at managed care contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is too early to quantify much of the activity, some
numbers are startling: 10 percent of the doctors affiliated with
New York Presbyterian Hospital have dropped out of managed care in
the last three months, and 50 percent have whittled the plans they
accept, said Dr. Myron Weisfeldt, chairman of the hospital's
department of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a tremendous number of physicians that to one degree
or another are beginning to separate themselves from managed care
at some financial risk to themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are signs that the movement extends past New York
City's borders: the Summit Medical Group, a 100-doctor practice in
Summit, N.J., for instance, recently dropped Blue Cross, and others
are expected to follow suit, said Dr. Greg Sachs, president of the
Medical Society of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors' opposition to managed care is on the increase
elsewhere, as well. In California, doctors have formed a group to
push their opposition, and in Texas, some are also forswearing
managed care. But experts say New York is particularly interesting
because doctors here are rejecting a system that is still quite new
and that rolled into the region at a breakneck speed in the last
few years. Chief among their complaints have been reduced fees and
more restrictions from the insurance companies on referrals and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``California had an evolution toward managed care, and we have
had a revolution,'' said Aswad. ``And that is why you hear about
these disruptions and large groups suddenly getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   This movement raises difficult questions about whether doctors
can and should expect to make the same good living they did before
the managed care movement, and whether a decision among some of the
brightest and best to drop managed care plans simply re-creates the
caste system of care that health maintenance organizations were
meant to eliminate by providing preventive care and a variety of
services.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, New York is not leaving the managed care business. The
HMO Trade Conference, a trade group, said it has not yet heard of
managed care companies worrying about a mass exodus.
</P>
<P>
   But it is just as clear that in the last few months many
doctors, who have been unhappy about managed care almost since its
introduction to the New York area, seem to be dropping out
entirely, for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, consolidation among the managed care companies
has increased, underscored by the announcement that Aetna U.S.
Healthcare _ whose tough bargaining on rates makes it one of the
least popular insurance carriers among doctors _ would acquire
Prudential Health Care. As the companies grow larger, their ability
to dictate rates and policies is likely to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Further, many companies have cut reimbursement rates
significantly in recent months, causing many doctors to conclude
that they cannot make any money by accepting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't stand it,'' said Thomashow, the pulmonary
specialist in Washington Heights. ``The thought of being put on
hold lines by people who don't know a quarter of what you are doing
to get permission for patients to go to the bathroom was
distasteful to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The revolt tends be led by doctors who have affluent patients
who are both demanding and willing to pay for the services if they
must. But some doctors, whose patient population is more diverse,
are trying to form groups to challenge the companies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Mount Kisco Medical Group in Mount Kisco, N.Y.,
has started to take advantage of its size _ 64 doctors under one
roof _ to negotiate with managed care companies. It has dropped
some plans that were demanding too much paperwork, said Dr. Scott
Hayworth, the group's chief executive officer. But it negotiated a
more favorable contract with others, including Oxford and Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are 64 doctors,'' Hayworth said, ``so we are lucky because
we have better negotiating power. Does that mean if you could wave
a magic wand and make managed care go away, would we? We would want
that for sure. But we make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict that more large groups will come together _
perhaps in the form of unions. But forming groups does not always
assure power.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1994 Dr. Jonas Goldstone and Dr. Saul Kaplan
formed Mid-Manhattan Medical Associates, an association of 26
doctors from various specialties who organized as a group to
arrange better ancillary services, like laboratories, and to deal
with managed care through a central business office.
</P>
<P>
   While many of their goals as a group have been met, they have
not won better reimbursement rates from insurance carriers, they
said. ``We are finding out that the projected income we expected in
dealing with managed care has not materialized,'' Goldstone said.
At this point, he added, ``A number of us are seriously considering
exiting managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone's doctor informs her he will no longer accept her
insurance plan, the options are clear: She finds another doctor or
she pays up. And if she is in a plan that partially reimburses for
visits to doctors out of the network, she files a claim.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, too, are bridling at managed care. The biggest
complaint is that companies are refusing to reimburse for the full
number of days that patients spend in the hospital, arguing that
certain illnesses can be treated in shorter stays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot overstate enough the sense of frustration within the
hospitals,'' said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York
Hospital Association, a trade group for local hospitals. ``We have
gone from tolerance to feverish pitch, and we are seeking help from
the authorities as well as lawmakers so HMOs stop abusing
hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   The association has asked the state attorney general's office to
pursue the matter of trimming days, and the association is
contemplating lawsuits against individual companies, Raske said.
</P>
<P>
   Most doctors say that quality of care, not their own earnings,
is driving their decisions. They argue, for instance, that when
managed care companies push for high-volume practices, it reduces
the time they can devote to each patient, teaching, reading medical
journals and working in clinics.
</P>
<P>
   They also recognize the painful reality that only middle-class
and wealthier patients are likely to have insurance plans that
allow them to choose their own doctor in exchange for a lower
reimbursement rate, typically 80 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a practice just for rich people,'' said Softness,
the pediatrician. ``That was never my plan. But I also want to be
able to give the kind of care that I think people deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   But some health care experts argue that a tiered health care
system is in the offing with a movement like this one. ``I think we
are moving toward a two-tiered or three-tiered structure of health
care,'' said Michael Lichman, senior vice president of Willis
Corroon of New York, one of the country's largest insurance
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Others, too, argue that despite a glut of doctors in the 1980s,
doctors' incomes rose higher than that of other professionals. They
contend that in a supply and demand economy, lower salaries would
have been expectable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If doctors say that quality will fall as reimbursements fall,
they are insulting themselves,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health
economist at Princeton University. ``The truth of the matter is
that when a group of laborers are in surplus, wages fall. They are
the only group that is unwilling to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who serve the poor, doctors fresh out of school who have
no established patient base, and doctors working in towns where one
employer dominates the market simply cannot refuse managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't drop HMOs if you have a family to feed and a dog who
depends on you,'' said Lichman. ``Patients have become used to
walking into a doctor's office and paying $10, and you can't say,
`OK, I'm back in the fee-for-service business.'''
</P>
<P>
   But as long as employers continue to offer plans that give
employees a chance to go to doctors outside their networks _ which
is likely in a strong economy _ and HMOs continue to push for
doctors to cut costs, more are likely to leave the HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear every day about other groups of doctors who are
dropping managed care,'' said Dr. Barry Chaiken, who founded the
Association of Independent Physicians in New York, a new and
growing group of doctors free of managed care. ``As managed care
comes in and insists on fee discounts of 30 percent or more,
physicians have to change their practices to survive.''

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A year ago, after the first reports of the
president's affair with Monica Lewinsky, Rep. Henry Hyde reacted
predictably enough, tamping down what he clearly saw as a lot of
loose, hotheaded talk about impeachment: ``You don't impeach him
for a peccadillo,'' he said then.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also said the president would not be impeached without
bipartisan agreement. He said public support was important, too.
And he promised that under his leadership, the House Judiciary
Committee proceedings would be marked by comity and bring honor to
the Congress. ``If we fall into partisan bickering, we will
disgrace this institution,'' he said in September. ``And we're not
about to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Good old Henry, whispered the Democrats, confident that the
famously fair-minded and genteel gentleman from Illinois would keep
the real partisans in check. Let the hard-liners howl at the moon,
the thinking went. Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia could hold his breath
until he turned purple but, thank God, Henry Hyde was the man in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in yet another twist in the labyrinthian Lewinsky scandal,
good old Henry surprised everyone. He opposed a Democratic proposal
that would have limited the inquiry and instead toyed with
expanding it. He argued against a censure option. And he presided
over hearings dominated by partisan attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Was this the same Henry Hyde who once had Democrats cheering his
opposition to Republican proposals on term limits? Yes, friends
said, but it was also a man whose position had hardened
considerably over the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by what he came to see as President Clinton's cavalier
attitude toward the law, the investigation and the committee, and
boxed in by Democrats who he felt had no intention of working with
him, the friends said, Hyde became convinced that he had no choice
but to push forward and impeach the president without them.
</P>
<P>
   As with some others who have gone up against Clinton, these
friends said, Hyde's reluctance gradually turned to resolve and his
hesitation to absolute certainty.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton was impeached _ without either bipartisan support
or popular approval, for behavior that did stem from what many
people dismissed as a peccadillo _ it was in no small measure as a
result of Hyde's determination to press forward.
</P>
<P>
   And now Hyde, who has lately been listening to the original
Broadway cast's recording of ``Man of La Mancha,'' is throwing
himself wholeheartedly into his new role as Clinton's chief
prosecutor in the Senate. Rep. David Dreier of California, one of
Hyde's closest friends on Capitol Hill, said the Judiciary
Committee chairman's attitude was ``If you're going to catch hell
no matter what you do, you might as well do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   After appointing a conservative team of prosecutors, Hyde was
pushing for a full trial with witnesses and fighting any effort to
truncate that process. Last week, some senators began grumbling
that they did not know who had died and made him ``Senator'' Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's resolve has been nearly unwavering from the start of his
committee's deliberations in October. Contrary to expectations that
he might be dissuaded by the Republicans' poor showing in the
November elections, his friends said, that drubbing, coupled with
persistent criticism from colleagues, had exactly the opposite
effect. If anything, it only emboldened Hyde to proceed without
worrying about the fallout, since both he and his party were
already taking some hits.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was Hyde in any way deterred by the disclosure, in the
fall, of an extramarital affair he had decades ago. A devout Roman
Catholic, Hyde spoke on the House floor of his great shame over the
relationship, but believed, too, that there is a clear difference
between a sin and a crime. ``To liken violations of the vows to
perjury,'' Dreier said, ``is just their attempt to bring about
similarities.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said Hyde had recovered from
the disclosure of his affair far more quickly than he had from a
recent incident involving the actor Alec Baldwin. On late night
television, Baldwin said, ``If we were in other countries ... all
of us together would go down to Washington and we would stone Henry
Hyde to death! We would stone him to death and we would go to their
homes and we'd kill their wives and their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin later apologized and said the bit was intended as
satire, but Sensenbrenner said Hyde, who has received death threats
and travels with four security guards, has been worried about his
family's safety ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dreier, who had lunch with Hyde on Thursday after he
presented the articles of impeachment in the Senate, said his
friend was in good spirits that day, joking, enjoying some ``real
crab cakes,'' and chatting about movies. (Hyde had already seen
``You've Got Mail,'' dismissing it as ``a chick flick,'' Dreier
said, and had tried to coax him into seeing the Adam Sandler
goofathon ``The Waterboy,'' with him this weekend.)
</P>
<P>
   Hyde is not plagued by doubts about whether he is doing the
right thing, Dreier said. ``He's just rolling with it now.''
</P>
<P>
   But for others, the transformation has been jarring _
``breathtaking,'' said the Congress-watcher Tom Mann of the
Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one thinks pressure from the party's conservative base
was much of a factor. This is Henry Hyde, they said, author of the
Hyde amendment, a hero to opponents of abortion and, at 74, a man
with nothing to prove.
</P>
<P>
   His friends insist that politics is not driving Hyde at all: As
one friend said, ``What's the political benefit to doing what he's
doing? If we find one more Jane Doe, Clinton's approval rating will
be at 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., said: ``The conventional wisdom
was that it was not in our interest to proceed, so why would we
want to? To enhance Al Gore's chances? Censure would have been much
more politically expedient, but he went the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Hyde under any obvious pressure from party leaders. ``I
don't think he was under orders here,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler,
D-N.Y. ``I think he just got more determined as time went on.''
</P>
<P>
   And friends say Nadler and other Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee are partly responsible for that evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's attitude shifted as he began to despair of being able to
work across the aisle as he had originally hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt he wasn't getting cooperation from the other side of
the aisle, so in kind he decided he had to get the job done with
Republicans,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn. ``It was a
polarized committee, and he thought in the end that the Democrats
had a strategy that didn't allow for much common ground. Henry was
ultimately the leader of this polarized and partisan outcome, but
he didn't want it that way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner, who sat next to Hyde on the committee and on a
couple of occasions sat in for him when the chairman ducked out for
a moment to cool down, said: ``Henry can get his back up when he
thinks he's being used. Everything he did the partisan pit bulls
sharply criticized.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadler seemed happy to acknowledge getting under the chairman's
skin. ``Henry is a very determined guy and I think he was getting
exasperated at Democrats' not playing along,'' Nadler said,
laughing. ``We were not going to make his job any easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats on the committee said they felt Hyde was
influenced by his counsel, David Schippers, who also began his work
with an aura of bipartisanship as a lifelong Democrat but soon
adopted a hard line regarding the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, another Democrat on the
committee, said he thought he saw signs of what he called the
``bridge over the River Kwai syndrome.'' ``After a while, pride of
craft takes over,'' Frank said, ``and you just want to build the
bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   At a number of junctures, Hyde's associates said, he was
frustrated by what he came to see as Clinton's disrespect for the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is deeply offended by the president's conduct during this
entire matter'' in ways that have ``nothing to do with his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky,'' Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, colleagues said, Hyde became convinced that he
had no choice but to protect the court system that he felt would be
seriously undermined if every citizen with a skeleton in his closet
decided under which circumstances it might be permissible to lie
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   And after Hyde saw Clinton's answers to the 81 questions the
committee had put to him, several people close to him said Hyde
felt there was no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   One person familiar with Hyde's thinking over the last few
months said that ``after the nonresponsive answers on the 81
questions, he said in a meeting of fellow Republicans, `Boys, I
don't see what choice we have now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly underestimated by the White House, Hyde was, in the
end, ``critical in convincing Republicans to impeach him anyway
after the election,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They mistook a teddy-bear exterior for a soft core,'' said
Ralph Reed, the Republican strategist, who knows Hyde well. ``If he
feels strongly about something, he'll fight harder than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one can doubt that Hyde now feels strongly about the case
against Clinton.

IN RUSSIA, EVEN HOLIDAYS ARE LONG AND PERPLEXING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It has been a long haul. Russians are confused,
exhausted and hung over, their resources and emotions spent. But
now at last they can see an end in sight _ not to Russia's
open-ended economic crisis, but to the year-end holidays, which
like the local winter seem to go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, when something approaching a normal work schedule
starts again, most Russians will have had seven of the last nine
days off, and that is only counting the official holidays: four
over New Year's weekend and another three following Russian
Orthodox Christmas, which falls on Jan. 7. Unofficially, many a
factory and office simply shut down for the duration, in part
because it was too difficult to figure out which days were
workdays.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason, of course, is that long holidays are a handy
excuse for not paying salaries for work that is not being done _ a
familiar practice in postcommunist Russia even in the nonholiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   But then there were stores, and offices _ all of them private _
that defied the Christmas holidays, because they could not afford
to stay shut for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not profitable to be closed yet another day,'' said
Valery Bazunov, whose Dial Electronics Store, on Moscow's busy
Garden Ring Road, stayed open Jan. 7 and 8. ``Christmas is not such
a holiday yet,'' said Bazunov, the store director, referring to
Soviet times when the atheist communist regime did not celebrate
Christmas. ``It is just like another day off.''
</P>
<P>
   Given this year's unusually perplexing calendar, many stores and
offices had to post schedules on their doors advising customers and
clients who might otherwise not be aware that Sunday, Jan. 10, is a
regular working day, filling in for Friday, Jan. 8, technically a
day off.
</P>
<P>
   At the local American Express office, the listing took up a full
page. Closely spaced explanations were aimed to guide the
uninitiated foreign tourist through the maze of two interlocking
Russian traditions _ one anchored by the Russian Orthodox Church's
calendar, the other a Soviet bureaucratic habit of moving holidays
around like pawns on a chessboard.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Sunday periodically pops up as a regular working day
_ in spite of the postcommunist government's low bow to the Russian
Orthodox Church, hailed by President Boris Yeltsin in his Christmas
Day message as an irreplaceable pillar of Russian nationhood. After
74 years of state atheism, the church has regained its place of
honor, with both Easter and Christmas celebrated as national
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the church raised a ruckus a few years ago when Pentecost
Sunday _ one of the holiest days in the church year _ turned up as
a workday in a swap for a weekday secular holiday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were no protests this year when Sunday, Jan. 10, was
offered in exchange for Jan. 8, the day after Christmas. In fact,
the Christmas holiday began on Jan. 6, Christmas Eve, when churches
around the country opened their doors for services that lasted
until the early hours.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 4 was made part of the New Year's holiday
(compensating for Jan. 2, which is normally a holiday in Russia but
this year it fell on a Saturday), that left Jan. 5 as virtually the
only day between Dec. 31 and Jan. 10 when Russians on the
government payroll could reasonably be expected to put in a full
day of work.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian shopper, who since Soviet times has given presents
on New Year's, is also caught these days in a clash of calendars.
Western Christmas is not celebrated here, yet it has crept into the
commercial cycle, along with Santa Claus and ``Jingle Bells.'' Some
Moscow stores were even offering post-Christmas discounts before
New Year's, one week before Russians even get around to thinking
about their own Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the return of religion in the postcommunist period, many
Russians have only a vague idea of what Christmas is. The annual
televised transmission of the Christmas Eve service led by the head
of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II, is still
accompanied by a hushed explanation of the old Slavonic texts. For
those who do not attend church services, Jan. 7 and 8 are simply
new holidays, not unlike Russia's Constitution Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, we haven't even been able to get around to
thinking about Christmas,'' said Andrei, a 27-year-old former
bartender who lost his job this fall when Russia's financial crisis
swept through Moscow. ``It was hard enough to get what we needed to
celebrate New Year's.''
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve remains the main day of festivity, when Russian
families gather around tables covered with food, and children wait
for Grandfather Frost to leave presents under their decorated fir
trees.
</P>
<P>
   This year, despite the financial crisis, Moscow stores reported
a hefty surge in sales. The aisles, even in expensive shops, were
full, and the streets, decked out in holiday lights, were jammed
with cars in the days before New Year's Eve. Big-ticket items like
cars were in demand as shoppers tried to sneak in ahead of new tax
regulations that will require an income declaration for purchases
worth more than $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the presents this year were the small
souvenirs that Russians especially treasure. Many of these trinkets
featured rabbits in one form or another, as 1999, according to the
Chinese calendar, is the year of the rabbit _ a friendlier mascot
than the tiger of 1998, which is not regarded as one of Russia's
best years.

BRITISH RESEARCHERS ON ANIMAL-RIGHTS MOVEMENT'S DEATH LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England _ Colin Blakemore, Wayneflete Professor of
Physiology at Oxford and director of the university's Center for
Cognitive Neuroscience, spends his days like any academic, in an
office with brimming in-trays and bookshelves stacked high with
research volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Nights he's at home in an undisclosed suburb in a house
surrounded by high fences, security cameras, alarms and tripwire
lights and configured inside with shielded doors, hidden intercoms
and a front hallway blocked from view to deny direct aim to any
shooter outside. His mail has been examined closely ever since
police intercepted a gift for his teen-age daughter in Christmas
wrapping five years ago that turned out to be a cardboard calendar
tube filled with high explosives and needles.
</P>
<P>
   His work has won him awards for advances in treating vision
problems in infants and young children. But it has also attracted
the attention of a violence-prone movement that says it wants to
kill him because his research depends on animal testing.
</P>
<P>
   His enemies are members of groups with flag-of-convenience names
like the Animal Liberation Front, the Justice Department, the
Animals Betrayed Coalition, Band of Mercy and the Animal Rights
Militia.
</P>
<P>
   They are clandestine organizations that have taken a passion
long associated with England _ the care and welfare of animals _
and transformed it into a ski-masked movement with absolutist
notions and the tactics of terror in defense of ``our animal
brothers and sisters.'' A number of its members are serving lengthy
jail terms for bombing campaigns against corner drugstores,
laboratories, woolen mill shops, kennels, slaughterhouses,
refrigerator trucks, fishmongers, butchers and animal breeding
farms.
</P>
<P>
   The first animal welfare group in the world was founded in
England in 1824, and the country has 3,000 such organizations
today. Far from representing just the cuddly house pets that get
protection in many societies, England is famous to the point of
being lampooned for having groups dedicated to the preservation of
bats, frogs, insects and rodents.
</P>
<P>
   The fringe groups have left the civilities of the traditional
cause behind. They have safe houses, secret bank accounts, codes,
Internet mailing lists and bomb-making instruction manuals.
Scotland Yard's special antiterror branch has a separate databank
called the Animal Rights National Index.
</P>
<P>
   Though some 15,000 British scientists use animals like mice,
rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, cats and monkeys to research diseases
and produce medicines, Blakemore, a 54-year-old Cambridge graduate
with a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley, has
been prominent in defending the practice as essential to the
progress of medical science.
</P>
<P>
   On the Animal Liberation Front Web site, Blakemore and his
fellow medical researchers are likened to Nazis. ``If we are
trespassing,'' it says, ``than so were the soldiers who broke down
the gates of Hitler's death camps.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of animal experiments in Britain has declined in the
last 25 years from 7 million a year to 2.6 million, and the code of
conduct governing them, laid down in a 1987 law, is the toughest in
the world. The levels of care demanded often exceed legal standards
for the housing and feeding of human beings in vulnerable
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But the activists want all testing to cease and threaten to back
their argument by assassinating 10 scientists who believe in animal
experimentation. Blakemore and two other researchers who have
joined him in denouncing the movement head the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone hopes for the time when animals won't be needed at
all,'' Blakemore said in an interview. ``That would be marvelous.
I'd be the first to crack the champagne. But to pretend that we are
there now is not only a misrepresentation, it is actually
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, security at his home was tightened and new border
gates were installed in the narrow streets threading through
Oxford's Gothic campus buildings because of stepped-up threats from
the militant anti-vivisectionists. Police say the protection he
receives is modeled on that afforded Britons on Irish Republican
Army hit lists in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The British government has not denounced the activists as firmly
as Blakemore would like. But last month it said it was going to
replace laws created in the 1970s to address the IRA threat with a
single act that would expand the definition of terrorism to include
religious and ideological as well as political motives. Jack Straw,
the Home secretary, specified that would include ``animal rights
activists who perpetrate serious acts of terrorist violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The militants' cause galvanized last month around Barry Horne, a
46-year-old former garbageman who was jailed for 18 years for arson
attacks on shopping centers. Sixty days into a hunger strike, Horne
said he would starve himself to death unless a Royal Commission was
created to discuss the end of animal experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Horne said he had signed an order barring anyone from
force-feeding him if he lost consciousness. As he lived only on
liquids, his weight had gone from 196 pounds to 118 pounds, and he
was said to have lost the sight in one eye and the hearing in one
ear.
</P>
<P>
   The government had banned all animal testing in connection with
cosmetics, alcohol and tobacco products last fall, but it said it
would not be persuaded by the threats to do more. Horne's backers
said that when he died, the 10 scientists would be killed. The list
was posted on the Internet, and Horne said from his hospital bed:
``People must do what they feel is right in response to my death.
Look at the evil of the Nazis and the level of violence needed _
quite rightly _ to stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore urged Horne to spare himself and offered to meet with
his supporters. Spokesmen representing mainstream animal rights
groups denounced the forced starvation tactic and said it would
harm the image of those battling for the cause by legitimate means.
Eventually, Horne abandoned his hunger strike on Dec. 14 after 68
days. Doctors said none of the damage he had done himself was
irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore said he was determined to continue with efforts to
combat what he considers propaganda and disinformation about animal
testing. He argued that it was impossible to come up with any form
of conventional medical treatment that had not at some point
depended on research on animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just ask yourself about any technique that a doctor might do
to you and if it's conceivable that it was done for the first time
on a human being,'' he said. ``Take angioplasty. I say: `Hey, I've
got a great idea for solving this problem. We'll stick a little
tube up through an artery somewhere, and we'll thread it all the
way through this guy. Then we'll blow up a balloon in his coronary
vessel and crush the deposits of plaque.' Can you imagine someone
saying, `Yes, I'll be the first'? It's out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   To the argument that computer technology has made animal
experimentation unnecessary, Blakemore said, ``The way to focus on
that question is to note that the law in this country requires you
to demonstrate that there is no alternative to the use of animals
before you can get a project license.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore's research involves surgically altering the vision and
in some cases closing the eye lids of cats bred for the purpose,
tracking their reactions and then examining their brains once they
have been put to sleep with an overdose of anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a printout of the Internet death list, Blakemore said
defending himself was taking up 20 percent of his work time.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years he has succeeded in setting up a forum called
the Boyd Group in Edinburgh that brings together scientists and
animal rights activists who shun violent tactics. Protesters have
been able to press their case for cutting back on animal
experimentation as much as possible without jeopardizing medical
inquiry, and researchers have been able to describe steps they take
to reduce the suffering of animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy for agitators to create the impression that mad
scientists are doing horrendous stuff to helpless pet kitties when
it isn't true at all,'' Blakemore said. ``They never mention the
anesthetics we use or the benefits we obtain.''

   Over the next 25 years, cigarette makers will pay almost $246
billion to all 50 states to settle lawsuits. Here are some
proposals for spending the money in six states.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Alabama: $3.2 billion settlement. Legislature has approved $85
million for youth programs, including health coverage, new
detention centers and added probation officers; $500,000 to tobacco
control. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Colorado: $2.7 billion settlement. Panel recently recommended that
35 percent be spent on tobacco control and 44 percent on children's
health programs. Not binding on Legislature. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Louisiana: $4.4 billion settlement. Gov. Mike Foster has proposed
selling future tobacco payments now and using the money to pay off
state debt. It could then use the money to raise teachers'
salaries. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Minnesota: $6.1 billion settlement. Set aside $202 million for
anti-smoking efforts. Some have recommended an added $650 million,
but businesses and Gov. Jesse Ventura oppose the effort. &QL; 
 &QL; 
New York: $25 billion settlement. Both Gov. George Pataki and Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani have yet to make recommendations. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Texas: $17.3 billion settlement. Some lawmakers have suggested
using the money for programs like lowering tobacco use, researching
cancer and implementing health programs for those living along the
Mexican border. &QL;

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Jan. 10, moved Saturday and will be repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-STATEOFUNION-REVIEW (Washington) _ In State of the Union
speeches before members of Congress and the Supreme Court,
presidents have made an implicit argument that the three branches
of government may be equal, but some are more equal than others.
This year, as President Clinton assesses the union's state before
an audience that is considering ejecting him from office, he will
be testing that proposition. By James Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-CAPITAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Never in the history of
modern business has there been a class of companies that has
spiraled so high, so fast and with so little regard for convention
as the Internet companies whose market values continue to astonish
Wall Street. What is particularly surprising is that most of them
have few if any physical assets. By David Barboza. (With Graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY-LIDDY-REVIEW (Washington) _ It may be the ultimate slap
at the boys in suits who have long dominated U.S. politics: the
hottest electoral commodities, as of last week at least, are best
known for whom they married and have never run for public office:
Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Dole. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   PET-PSYCH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Given the money to be made catering
to Americans' twin obsessions with psychological advice and pets,
it's only a matter of time before a flood of books, TV shows, radio
programs and newspaper columns feature pop psychiatrists whose
specialty is putting Rover on the couch or on Prozac. BY Joe
Sharkey. (With Photo.)
</P>
<P>
   LANGUAGE-DATABASE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Linguists say that digital
libraries like JSTOR will reduce dependence on searching through
libraries to study the history of the language. Already, the word
`hopefully,' long considered a grammatical corruption that
originated in the 1960s, has been found in texts as far back as the
1930s. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   TV-ANCHORS-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Perhaps to enhance their
legitimacy, America's TV news anchors are increasingly drawn across
the boundary from electronic media to the solid ground of books on
paper. By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ Some liberals are beginning to
think that vouchers _ something they have largely shunned for use
in education _ might be good for Medicare. By Michael Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in `i' category
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-MAFIA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Comparing the Russian and Italian
mafias. In Italy, the word `mafia' signifies discreet criminal
organizations with strict hierarchical structures, but in Russia it
has come to mean much more. In Russia it embraces the noxious blend
of crime, politics and business that has engulfed the nation in the
post-Soviet era. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-PROFESSIONS-REVIEW (Phnom Penh) _ In exterminating
Cambodia's lawyers, doctors, teachers, engineers, accountants,
clerks, businessmen, monks, artists and other professionals in the
1970s, the Khmer Rouge not only destroyed Cambodia's culture,
commerce and civil society. It eliminated the people who might have
been available to rebuild them. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-DEATHSQAUDS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Iran's official admission
that a death squad within the intelligence service killed some of
the regime's critics was made only after the murders had already
unleashed a remarkably open public debate, in which people who
suddenly felt more vulnerable complained of the specter of official
terror. By Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   KISSINGER-TRANSCRIPTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Documents released from
the archives of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger include
transcripts of conversations that he and President Richard Nixon
had with Communist leaders like Mao Tse-tung and Leonid Brezhnev,
offering new insights on the thaw in the Cold War of the early and
mid-1970s.

CUBA ATTACKS U.S. EASING OF EMBARGO AS `DECEPTIVE'

(lb) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ A high-ranking Cuban official has denounced President
Clinton's proposals to ease some restrictions in the United States'
embargo of this communist-run island, calling them a ``deceptive
maneuver'' intended to deflect growing opposition around the world
to the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Ricardo Alarcon, the legislative leader who is
Fidel Castro's point man on negotiations with the United States,
said the changes were also meant to hide Clinton's rejection of a
bipartisan commission to review the wisdom of the 37-year-old
embargo. Two former Republican secretaries of state are among those
who have backed the proposal to set up a commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world thought at least this commission would be
created,'' Alarcon said in a two-hour address on state-run
television late Friday night. His remarks were widely publicized
here as Cuba's official response to Washington's overtures.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton announced a package of moves intended to
spur private enterprise in Cuba without helping Castro's
government. They included expanding direct charter flights to the
island, allowing more Americans to send cash to Cuba, establishing
direct mail service and sanctioning sales of food and agricultural
supplies to charities and privately held farms.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration has said the measures represent a
significant easing of the sanctions, Cuban officials have
characterized them as unimportant tinkering that does nothing to
alter the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposals came on top of a similar raft of minor changes
announced in March, when the Clinton administration said for the
first time it would allow direct flights to Cuba and legalized cash
transfers of up to $1,200 a year that Cuban-Americans could send to
their relatives on the island. The administration also said it
would allow U.S. companies to sell medicines to Castro's government
on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said the new policy is aimed at finding ways
to help individual Cubans and charities, and to encourage private
enterprise, without letting up pressure on Castro's government.
</P>
<P>
   In his rambling address, Alarcon presented a detailed chronology
of the events since March, arguing that Washington had failed to
live up to its promises to allow sales of medicine. He also pointed
out that the direct flights to Cuba and legalized remittances had
in practice changed nothing at all. Cuban-Americans had been
sending money home through illegal channels in any case and were
always able to travel to Cuba through other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon also suggested that the new proposal to let Americans
other than relatives send money to Cubans had a sinister purpose.
Noting that Cuban-Americans in Miami had financed terrorist groups
that have, among other things, bombed hotels in Havana, Alarcon
suggested the new rules would let right-wing extremists in Miami
funnel more money to would-be counterrevolutionaries so that they
could ``look for ways to manufacture traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the natural and normal help given within a family,
but has an end clearly subversive and counterrevolutionary,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon added that Cuban-Americans were the only immigrants in
the United States who were not allowed to send whatever amount of
money they liked to their relatives. He called the policy
discriminatory and repressive. He also played down the importance
of Washington's proposal to let charter flights leave the United
States from cities other than Miami, saying that Clinton had said
as much in March but that the changes had never been carried out.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Much of Alarcon's speech was devoted to listing a number of
liberal legislators and advocacy groups in the United States that
have protested against the embargo in recent months. He also
highlighted the fact that the U.N. General Assembly has voted
overwhelmingly for seven years to ask the United States to drop the
policy.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of direct mail between the two countries,
Alarcon said there was a risk that militant anti-Castro factions in
the United States would try to use the service to send letter
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the fundamental questions I would ask the U.S.,'' he
said, ``is: What are you going to do with your terrorists? How are
you going to guarantee nobody here is going to suffer?''
</P>
<P>
   Winding up his talk, Alarcon urged Cubans to confront this ``new
attempt of aggression, this new attempt to attack us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an attack on an ideological plane, a political plane,
without giving in reality anything, trying to confuse and trick
you,'' he said. ``I'm sure all of our people sincerely are going to
reject this new face of the war against Cuba. They are going to
continue forward with the same patriotic spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he predicted the White House would eventually succumb to
pressure from liberal groups within the United States and from
other countries on the question of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite this deceptive maneuver, they know that this blockade,
this criminal policy, they are going to have to abandon it, they
are going to have to change it,'' he said. ``Someday they will have
to abandon it, because they won't be able to sustain it in front of
the growing opposition of the world.''

POLITICALLY WEAK AT HOME, TURKS FLEX MUSCLES ABROAD
</HEADLINE>

By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Turkey may soon have a functioning government
after six weeks without one, but its new-found assertiveness in
foreign policy is likely to continue no matter who emerges as the
next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Once a bashful actor on the world stage, Turkey has begun
flexing its muscles whenever it feels the need.
</P>
<P>
   Through blunt warnings of economic pressure and even military
strikes, Turkish leaders are using their growing power as masters
of the 18th-largest economy to achieve what they consider vital
policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   Benefiting in part from the new weakness of Russia, Iran and
Iraq and regional rivals once backed by Soviet power, the Turks
have achieved surprisingly good results.
</P>
<P>
   This success is all the more remarkable in light of the
country's deep political problems.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, faced with allegations of
corruption, lost a confidence vote in Parliament on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   He has been serving as a caretaker during weeks of political
maneuvering that may finally produce a government led by a veteran,
the former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who hopes to put together
a Cabinet by Monday and win a Parliamentary confidence vote Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Turkey has not had a stable government since the 1995
election, Turkish foreign policy has become tougher and more
forceful than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Its most recent success came on the tense island of Cyprus,
which is divided between Turkish and Greek sectors: The
Greek-backed Cypriot government had planned to deploy Russian
anti-aircraft missiles; Turkey responded by promising to bomb them.
The week before last, the Cypriots backed down.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey cannot claim full credit for staring down the Cypriots,
because the United States and several European countries had also
urged that the deployment be canceled to avoid dangerous friction
between two NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   But in other areas, Turkish leaders have won important battles
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Turkish generals and political leaders demanded that
Syria expel a Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who has
directed a 14-year guerrilla war in southeastern Turkey. They
strongly hinted that Turkey would attack Syria if it did not
comply. To reinforce their message, they massed soldiers along the
Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
   With an alacrity that some in the region found astonishing,
Syria quickly knuckled under and expelled Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Syria was feeling weak,'' said a European diplomat
with long experience in the Middle East. ``It couldn't have
resisted an attack by Turkey and it didn't want to be humiliated,
especially with Israel watching.''
</P>
<P>
   From Syria Ocalan flew to Russia. Turkish officials warned
Russia that if he was allowed to stay there, they would demand
instant repayment of Russian debts and force the scores of Turkish
companies operating in Russia to cease operations immediately.
Within days, Ocalan was in the air again, this time headed to
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders demanded that Italy send him home to face trial.
But Italy, which is governed by a left-leaning coalition that
includes some who sympathize with Kurdish rebels, proved less
pliant and refused.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged Turks have threatened to ban Italian imports, which are
worth many millions of dollars to Italian companies, and to reject
Italian bids for huge Turkish military contracts. Newspapers here
predict that Italy will soon see the error of its ways and send
Ocalan away.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is also using high-pressure tactics to persuade foreign
oil companies that they should build their main export pipeline for
Caspian crude oil through Turkey. The companies want to build a
shorter and cheaper pipeline to Georgia, then ship the crude in
tankers across the Black Sea and through the Bosporus, the narrow
strait that bisects Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   But Foreign Minister Ismail Cem replied that the Bosporus is
already full and that Turkey will no longer ``grant any priority to
oil tankers.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Turks went even further: They told the two main
partners in the Caspian oil consortium, Amoco and British
Petroleum, that if they continue to support the Georgia route,
Turkey will revoke their permits to explore for oil in Turkish
waters. Turkish officials also said they would disqualify Amoco's
bid to build a new $500 million liquid natural gas terminal here.
</P>
<P>
   By some standards, Turkey is well positioned to use such tough
tactics. Despite its debilitated political system it has a strong
economy, a population of 65 million and 370,000 soldiers under
arms, more than any other NATO country except the United States.
Partly due to its old alliance with the United States and its new
partnership with Israel, its military is well trained, disciplined
and equipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as recently as 1990, the Turkish state was largely Third
World militarily and economically,'' said Alan Makovsky, a
specialist in Turkish affairs at the Washington Institute for Near
East Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had no modern weaponry, it faced countries that were well
armed and backed by the Soviets and it was basically inward
looking. Now all of that has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 1,000 M-60 tanks and 200 F-16 fighters, Makovsky
said, the Turks ``can stir the pot in a way they couldn't five
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When they threaten economic or even military retaliation,'' he
added, ``it's not something that's easy to dismiss.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MORROPE, Peru _ Catholics cannot be baptized or married in
Morrope anymore. The graceful colonial church is locked shut. And
the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy has threatened to suspend all
charitable donations to this desert town of 39,000 souls, who are
still reeling from the floods brought by El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   Morrope's problem, at least as far as the local bishop is
concerned, is that its Catholic priest has two teen-age children
whom he fathered years after he entered the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   The priest, the Rev. Jorge Arbanil Rico, 44, is unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   Every day he offers Mass in the town cemetery and in the streets
accompanied by a jaunty New Orleans-style band of drummers and
saxophone and trumpet players, against the orders of the church
hierarchy. He has become a cause celebre for a movement of retired
Peruvian priests who say he should be considered a model for the
Roman Catholic priest of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time anyone can remember, at least in modern
Peruvian history, that a priest has defied the Roman Catholic
hierarchy by continuing to practice priestly functions _ with the
exceptions of marriages and baptisms _ while openly admitting to
having broken his vow of celibacy. He will not identify the boys'
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But Arbanil Rico's case is not unique. One Peruvian priest in
Yurimaguas is openly married. Another from a settlement just
outside Huancayo reportedly lives with a 12-year-old son and has
defied the hierarchy by giving press interviews. But these other
would-be rebels have received the quiet acquiescence of their local
bishops.
</P>
<P>
   The blooming controversy comes at a time when as many as one in
every four priests in Latin America leaves the priesthood before
retirement age, often to marry. And while rural Latin America
remains deeply Catholic, a shortage of priests has helped
Protestant evangelicals make deep inroads.
</P>
<P>
   In this context the religious rebellion in Morrope has become
the top story in many Peruvian newspapers and news broadcasts since
Sunday, when townspeople showed a newly appointed priest, the Rev.
Pedro Vasquez Reano, to a mule _ a not too subtle hint that they
wanted him to go away. The standoff devolved into a rock and
brick-throwing fight between supporters of the two priests that was
broadcast across Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only sin,'' Arbanil Rico said in an interview, ``is to
recognize my children and support them. The rule of celibacy is a
rule of the hierarchy, not a rule of the people of God. The
hierarchy is not the church; the church is the people of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbanil Rico is a soft-spoken, pudgy man who, at least at first
meeting, does not appear to be ready to fill Martin Luther's shoes.
He does not express particularly deep thoughts, and his only
pastimes _ walking and reading magazines and newspapers _ mark him
as a simple man.
</P>
<P>
   But his words are revolutionary. ``The pope,'' he said, ``is a
member of the faith like any other Catholic. He just has an
administrative function.'' Nevertheless, Arbanil Rico said he was
thinking about making a personal appeal to Pope John Paul II to
review his case.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Guillermo Rouillon, national coordinator of the National
Movement for Dialogue and Life, an organization of 100 mostly
retired priests, estimated that as many as 40 percent of Peru's
3,700 priests ``have children, but they can't talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Priests have had children since the Spanish came here four
centuries ago but nobody wanted to talk about it until now,'' said
Rouillon, 62, who left the priesthood 30 years ago and has been
living with the same woman for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Jesus Moline Labarta of Chiclayo, who stripped Father
Arbanil Rico of his parochial duties, refused to discuss the case.
But the Bishop's private secretary, the Rev. Rolando Monteza, said
the matter of priests having children ``is not a big problem for
the church.'' He predicted that ``eventually the people of Morrope
will accept their new priest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peruvian Episcopal Conference, the highest governing body of
the church in Peru, supports the bishop's position. The Vatican has
not commented.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that this dusty town of adobe and straw 400 miles
northwest of Lima is deeply divided, despite a history of rebellion
and labor strife that goes back to colonial times, when the Mochica
Indians successfully resisted efforts by the Conquistadores to
build a church over their religious altar in what is still the town
square.
</P>
<P>
   Arbanil Rico received only tepid applause from a crowd assembled
in front of the church last week when he defiantly cradled a
religious statuette on the steps during a procession recreating a
medieval pageant in which ancient Indian deities are transformed
into the Wise Men. Still, on the same day, he was warmly received
by more than 50 people in a shantytown when he said Mass under a
makeshift hut decorated with colorful plastic flowers, a Nativity
scene and Peruvian flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the Bible, it is never a sin to have children,''
said Melchor Valdera, a 30-year-old fisherman who attended the
street Mass. ``We support our priest.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbanil Rico has not had a textbook career.
</P>
<P>
   He was persuaded to study for the priesthood at age 17 by a
high-school religion teacher, the Rev. Carlos Flores Pajares, who,
Arbanil Rico said, lived with a woman and had two children. ``At
the seminary,'' he said, ``for us, celibacy meant not marrying.
They did not speak of virginity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arbanil Rico said he remained a virgin through the first few
years of his priesthood. Then he met a distant cousin at her
mother's birthday party, and he said there was an instant
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Arbanil Rico would not identify the woman nor his two sons, age
15 and 17, who he said lived in Lima. But he said that he has not
had sexual relations with the woman for many years, and that he has
never slept with any other woman.
</P>
<P>
   Arbanil Rico said he had told his bishop, the Most Rev. Ignacio
Maria de Orbejozo y Goicochea, of his children through another
priest, who served as an intermediary. He said he was ordered not
to sign the birth certificates of his sons after each was born, but
he disobeyed orders.
</P>
<P>
   Through the intermediary, Arbanil Rico said, the bishop told him
he could continue working in his parish as long as he kept his
fatherhood a secret. But last May, de Orbejozo y Goicochea died,
and was replaced by a less forgiving bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Arbanil Rico said the new cleric, Bishop Moline Labarta,
discovered his secret in private personnel files.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't care about the several priests in his files who
have children but don't recognize them,'' he said. ``My sin is that
I am willing to say that I have children.''

A CANADIAN ROUSTS DIPLOMACY (AND RUFFLES THE U.S.) 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ As a graduate student at Princeton University in the
1960s, Lloyd Axworthy spent many nights at the old Madison Square
Garden in New York watching greats like Dave DeBusschere, Walt
Frazier and Bill Bradley outplay almost everyone in the league.
</P>
<P>
   It did not help his studies, Axworthy concedes, but the New York
Knicks' approach to basketball did help him develop a game plan
that has made him the most successful Canadian foreign minister in
years, and also the one who has most antagonized Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody asks me to define Canadian foreign policy, I say,
`Take a look at the Knicks of the DeBusschere, Frazier, Bill
Bradley era,''' Axworthy said. ``They were a bit slower than other
teams, and they were not as big, but they were crafty.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada has been a small, poky player on the international scene,
but in his three years as head of Canada's foreign ministry,
Axworthy, a former college professor, has made waves, often by
running up against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He was instrumental in getting the international treaty to ban
land mines signed in Ottawa in 1997, even though the United States
opposed it. Canada was center court on the push to establish an
international criminal court, once more against the wishes of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   He does not support NATO's use of nuclear weapons, he does not
want Canada to increase military spending substantially, and last
week he visited Cuba again to embrace Fidel Castro's Communist
government despite continuing U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Canada has a leadership seat on the U.N. Security
Council, Axworthy has made it clear he intends to use the position
to try to limit the veto powers of the United States and the
council's other four permanent members.
</P>
<P>
   But what upsets Washington most about Axworthy is the way his
policies often ignore the different responsibilities that Canada
and the United States have in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The United States objected to the international criminal court,
for example, because there were no controls to insure that it would
not be used maliciously against American officials involved in
missions like the one in Iraq, again something of little concern to
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we have greater responsibilities, we have to look at
other aspects than do the Canadians,'' a senior American diplomat
said, ``and sometimes we would appreciate more understanding from
Axworthy of the different relationships we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy bristles at the suggestion that he or his initiatives
are anti-American. ``Look at the record,'' he said during an
interview in Toronto, where he had stopped recently to tape two
television appearances. ``There's no question that there are
differences. But they're not differences that are designed to be
anti-American.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Axworthy made clear that while it might seem he
is out to poke a stick in America's eye, he is not. But still, he
refuses to consider the United States ``the indispensable nation''
that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has declared it to be.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful nation, for sure, he said, and probably the
most influential, too. ``But I think we can show from time to time
that things can happen without the United States being a
participant,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   However many his critics in Washington, and in Canada, Axworthy
has unquestionably put the diplomatic corps through its paces in a
way not seen since Lester Pearson, the Canadian diplomat and
foreign minister and a personal hero of Axworthy, won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1957 for proposing the use of peacekeeping forces to
settle the Suez crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada's government, ministries like foreign affairs are
headed by members of Parliament. Axworthy, a Liberal, just
celebrated his 25th year as an elected politician from Winnipeg,
Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   For Canadian politicians, taking a stand that is independent of
the United States has long been a way to win support at home.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy, 59, says he played the anti-American card himself,
earlier this decade, when he was free trade critic for the Liberal
opposition. ``I might have done that in the past, but I don't do it
now,'' he said. ``If anything, I really try to bend over backward
not to be critical of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in the north end of Winnipeg, in the Canadian plains,
and said that doing so helped him develop an affinity for and
understanding of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But as a liberal whose approach to politics was formed in the
1960s, he believes the world has changed more since the Cold War
ended than the United States is willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, most conflicts now occur within nations, rather
than between them. Casualties increasingly are civilians rather
than soldiers. As a result, traditional diplomacy has also been
transformed from the aloof maneuvering of statesmen to protect
national sovereignty to the concerted efforts of individuals and
organizations to care for people.
</P>
<P>
   It was such a coalition, with the aid of small countries like
Canada and Norway, that successfully pressed more than 120 nations
to sign the land mines treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy believes that Canada and other small nations can lend
moral authority to help solve such problems. ``It's not a position
that makes me very popular with the striped pants crowd,'' Axworthy
said, ``but I think it has a resonance with the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The striped pants crowd of traditional diplomats, backed by
academics and conservative columnists, indeed has trouble
swallowing Axworthy's brand of pulpit diplomacy. ``He has a
romantic progressivist vision of Canada as a multicultural
coalition against the rich and greedy West,'' wrote The National
Post. But ``he has forgotten that Canada is a part of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy clearly believes that even though the United States is
the world's only superpower, countries like Canada can set the
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States is a player it makes it so much easier,''
he said, ``but we can still do it without them.''

<P>
   Thomas O'Donnell, a newly elected vice president at large of the
Teamsters, obtained the second-largest vote total in last month's
union election _ only the new president, James Hoffa, received more
_ yet faces possible expulsion from the union.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered one of the most honest leaders in a union never
known for probity, O'Donnell, the president of a New York Teamsters
local since 1961, insists that he is being railroaded over
accusations of filing false campaign reports. He says his career is
being jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   A court-appointed review board has charged O'Donnell with filing
false campaign finance reports in 1996, when he ran on Hoffa's
slate in Hoffa's unsuccessful campaign for union president.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, the board said, sought to hide that Kevin Currie,
Hoffa's New York campaign manager that year, was a convicted felon.
Specifically, O'Donnell, who hired Currie, is accused of not
reporting that Currie received a salary and of concealing $12,700
in salary payments by making them to the campaign manager's wife.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against O'Donnell have assumed unusual importance
because they are an embarrassing blow to Hoffa, son of the famous
Teamsters leader, and because Hoffa and his chief of staff, Tom
Pazzi, may face similar charges. The two approved separate campaign
finance reports that listed payments for Currie that went to his
wife, Mary Ann.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa has repeatedly denied making false statements about this
and other campaign finance matters.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa lost the 1996 race to Ron Carey, but a new election was
ordered last year because three Carey aides siphoned money from the
union treasury into the Carey campaign. Hoffa _ and O'Donnell _
easily won the rerun race.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell is one of three vice presidents elected on the Hoffa
slate who face board charges that could lead to anything from
acquittal to expulsion from the union. O'Donnell is accused of
``bringing reproach'' upon the union _ an elastic term that allows
the review board, set up to oversee the union under a federal
consent decree, to punish those accused of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, president of a 270-member local made up of drivers
for filmmakers, television stations and concert halls, does not try
to hide his frustration about the charges. They are the first
charges he has faced since joining the Teamsters union 48 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried hard to avoid this type of stuff,'' O'Donnell said
in an interview at his office in Lake Success, N.Y. ``It's
embarrassing to me and my family. It's embarrassing to my
members.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell insisted that he did not want to hire Currie, even
though there was no union ban on employing convicted felons in the
campaign. He explained that Pazzi, previously Hoffa's national
campaign manager, pressed him to hire Currie.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said that he interviewed Currie before hiring him and
that Currie said he had never been convicted of a crime. Soon
after, O'Donnell said, he learned that Currie had been convicted of
grand larceny, and he again told Pazzi that he did not want to hire
Currie.
</P>
<P>
   But because Pazzi insisted, O'Donnell said, he hired Currie.
O'Donnell vowed not to pay Currie directly because he had lied
about the conviction. Instead, O'Donnell gave Currie's $700 weekly
check to Mrs. Currie, who was a part-time campaign worker. The
checks were made out to her.
</P>
<P>
   But the review board's charges state that O'Donnell told federal
monitors that one reason he decided to give the payments to Mrs.
Currie rather than Currie was to disguise that a felon was on the
campaign payroll. That, the board said, was not an innocent reason
for hiding Currie's role.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell insisted that he in no way hid Currie's role. He noted
that Currie maintained a pro-Hoffa Web site, had business cards
printed listing himself as the New York campaign manager and was
often listed on campaign finance reports when he was reimbursed for
campaign expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The review board will soon hold a hearing on the charges,
brought by the board's in-house prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell sounded pessimistic, saying the board unfailingly
finds against accused officials. O'Donnell's many supporters insist
that expelling him would cause the Teamsters' executive board to
lose one of its most honest officials.

GAP AMONG REPUBLICANS OVER TRIAL WASN'T TOO WIDE TO BRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the privacy of the Senate Republican cloakroom,
a gaggle of senators was furiously working on ground rules for
President Clinton's impeachment trial when Majority Leader Trent
Lott suddenly appeared on television with his Democratic
counterpart, Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican senators, including Slade Gorton of Washington,
Mike DeWine of Ohio, John Ashcroft of Missouri and Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, stopped what they were doing Thursday afternoon to watch
the announcement of a rare bipartisan meeting of the full Senate
set for the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments, the senators were alternately cheering and
criticizing Lott, applauding his leadership one moment and groaning
over a poor choice of words the next. ``It was like being in the
parents' section at a high-school football game,'' said one aide
who watched the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The plan that Democrats and Republicans unanimously approved
Friday, allowing the Senate to start an impeachment trial in
earnest this week, emerged from the unusual joint meeting in the
Old Senate Chamber. But the contours of that plan were hammered out
last week by a fractious Republican caucus that often pulled Lott
in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans control the Senate, by 55 to 45, and on Thursday
they could have imposed their will on the Democratic minority. At
the last minute, mainly because of objections raised by Olympia
Snowe of Maine, Republicans pulled back from the brink of a strict
party-line vote on competing plans, fearing that would brand them
as partisan as House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But even before engaging the Democrats, Republicans had to reach
accord among themselves, senators said, bridging ideological,
generational and institutional divides.
</P>
<P>
   Lott stood in the middle of this political maelstrom and
suffered sniping from colleagues. But he let senators vent their
feelings and assigned deputies to hash out details with Democrats.
And Wednesday, Lott presented Republicans with a plan that tried to
be fair to all parties without bogging the Senate down for months.
It became the basis for Friday's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in uncharted waters, and Trent Lott has had a
responsibility that would weigh heavy on St. Peter,'' said Sen.
Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   In seven hours of closed meetings over two days that led to
Friday's momentous joint conference in the Old Senate Chamber,
Senate Republicans veered from solemnity and sadness to passionate
pleas and an occasional jibe.
</P>
<P>
   Even as senators approached their task with grave purpose, an
edginess crept into many of the discussions. At one point, Lott
mulled aloud whether the caucus should hire a strong outside
counsel to help guide senators through the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a former federal prosecutor and counsel on the
Watergate committee, shot back with a suggestion that some senators
took as a barbed joke. ``I got just the guy for you: Dickie
Scruggs,'' Thompson said, referring to the Mississippi lawyer who
is Lott's brother-in-law and who helped negotiate last year's
tobacco settlement that later collapsed in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a damn low blow, Fred,'' Lott replied, senators said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of calling witnesses at the trial divided Senate
Republicans from Democrats. But Republicans were divided among
themselves, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of Lott, including Gorton, Thad Cochran of Mississippi
and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, backed a bipartisan plan to avoid
witnesses by holding early test votes on the two articles of
impeachment. But several Republicans, many of them conservatives,
refused to support that approach, which they said would
short-circuit a credible trial with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The witness debate boiled over in one of two meetings on
Thursday, senators said, when Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska said that
with crises brewing in the Balkans and North Korea, the Senate
should move quickly to a bipartisan resolution, even if that meant
jettisoning witnesses the House managers wanted. Sen. John
Ashcroft, a conservative from Missouri, immediately challenged
Stevens, a Senate fixture, saying, ``What do we stand for if we're
willing to throw witnesses overboard?''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over witnesses also revealed a generational rift
between old-guard senators like Stevens and Sen. Pete Domenici of
New Mexico, who feared that calling witnesses like Monica Lewinsky
could demean the Senate's institutional integrity, and younger,
conservative firebrands like Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Tim
Hutchinson of Arkansas and James Inhofe of Oklahoma, who said a
trial with witnesses was the only way to render justice.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal for witnesses on the part of the House managers who
will present the case against the president got mixed reviews from
senators, depending in part on whether Senate Republicans had first
served in the House themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those senators who are former House members feel strongly that
we should let the House managers present their case,'' said Sen.
Susan Collins of Maine. ``Those of us with no ties to the House are
more concerned about our roles as jurors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideology was not always a good indicator of a senator's
position. Ms. Collins and Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, both
moderates, nonetheless voiced arguments for calling a limited
number of witnesses to help untangle conflicting testimony.
</P>
<P>
   For many back-benchers, the caucus meetings were a chance to
offer emotional speeches that tapped personal experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Conrad Burns of Montana, a former marine, invoked vivid
images of Omaha Beach to underscore that senators, too, sometimes
have to fulfill painful and unpopular responsibilities. ``This is
an issue that lives in the back of your mind and gnaws at you,''
Burns said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings did have their lighter moments. When Sen. Frank
Murkowski of Alaska stood up to speak, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas,
who was sitting in front of Murkowski, piped up in his Texas twang:
``Go up to the microphone, Frank. I want to see your face.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dutifully, Murkowski walked up to the front and started to
speak, only to be interrupted by Gramm: ``Well, gosh, Frank, on
second thought, come on back and sit down.''  &QL;

<P>
   Fifteen states so far have taken the politically popular step of
abolishing parole boards, a vestige of what most Americans regard
as a failed system of penal rehabilitation, and last week New York
Gov. George Pataki proposed to make his state the 16th.
</P>
<P>
   But based on the experience of the other states, there is no
proof that eliminating parole boards reduces crime, while it can
lead to a further increase in the already swelling prison
population, criminologists and other experts say.
</P>
<P>
   For politicians promoting tough-on-crime platforms, it can have
an unintended consequence: Connecticut, Colorado and Florida
reinstituted parole boards after eliminating them because the
resulting increase in inmates crowded prisons so much that the
states were forced to release many of them early.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a number of prison experts, including some who warn that
eliminating parole boards could lead to shorter time served for
less serious crimes, say the parole system is such a failure that
abolishing it does not make much difference. Scrapping parole
boards, they say, could save money that might be used on more
effective anti-crime programs.
</P>
<P>
   The parole system, like the modern prison, was an American
invention in the 19th century. It consists of two parts, parole
boards that have the authority to decide when to release prisoners,
and parole officers who supervise convicts after their release.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pataki's proposal, New York would follow other states by
eliminating the authority of the state parole board while keeping
released prisoners subject to supervision by parole officers.
</P>
<P>
   One argument against eliminating parole boards is that an
inmate's release then becomes automatic, at the end of a set term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You decrease the ability to keep very dangerous offenders in
prison,'' said Joan Petersilia, a leading authority on parole who
is a professor of criminology at the University of California at
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Prof. Petersilia pointed out, the convicted
kidnapper Richard Allen Davis was rejected six times by the parole
board, but after the state passed a law ending parole, he was
released automatically because he had served a sufficient amount of
time; a few months later he murdered 13-year-old Polly Klaas.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts caution that the public's discontent with the
parole system has also led to a change in the role of parole
officers that is contributing to more ex-convicts being returned to
prisons, swelling their populations.
</P>
<P>
   As the penal system has moved away from rehabilitation, parole
officers have been transformed from social workers who helped
offenders find jobs or get drug treatment to law-enforcement agents
who are more concerned with surveillance, from electronic
monitoring and curfews to drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   In California, 80 percent of parolees are failing to complete
parole successfully. In 1997, 57 percent of the people entering the
state's prisons were parole violators, not criminals convicted of
new crimes, Professor Petersilia said.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the parole system is so flawed that parole
boards may as well be eliminated, but they caution that politicians
should be honest with the public about the cost of lengthening
prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   If all inmates serve longer terms, ``you will break the bank,''
said Martin Horn, Pennsylvania's secretary of corrections and a
former executive director of New York's Division of Parole. One way
to avoid that, he said, is to sentence less serious criminals to
shorter terms.
</P>
<P>
   As for parole officers, Horn said, past efforts in New York have
shown that when more money is spent on them, reducing their case
loads, they tend to find more violations among their parolees,
leading them to send more back to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Horn suggested that New York could achieve a more cost effective
crime policy by taking the $260 million it spent on its 60,000
parolees last year and spending some of it on vouchers that would
enable parolees to get drug treatment and job training, and the
rest on anti-poverty programs that would help reduce crime.
</P>
<P>
   New York's chief criminal justice official, Katie Lapp, said
Pataki's proposal to end parole had been carefully studied to
insure that the public knew how long criminals would actually spend
in prison, and that she did not expect a jump in the number of
inmates as California has experienced.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast with California, Ms. Lapp said, only 20 percent to
25 percent of the offenders sent to prison in New York are parole
violators, a sign that parole officers in New York are more
thoughtful about their approach.
</P>
<P>
   The movement to abolish parole began in the late 1970s after
academic studies suggested that rehabilitative efforts in prison
and early release on parole for good conduct had no measurable
effect on reducing repeat offenses. Among the states that have
eliminated parole boards are Arizona, California, Delaware,
Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio,
Oregon, New Mexico, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington.
California counts itself among these states, although its parole
board still considers a handful of cases of inmates who are serving
life sentences. The federal prison system has also gotten rid of
the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Only one state, Maine, has taken the additional step of dropping
its system of parole agents to supervise inmates after their
release.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation has embraced harsher punishment for violent
criminals, those states that still have boards have moved to
restrict their authority to less serious criminals. And parole
boards have become more hesitant to grant release. In Texas, the
proportion of eligible inmates approved for parole in 1998 dropped
to just 20 percent, from 57 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But the three states that eliminated parole and subsequently
re-established the equivalent of parole boards did so after finding
that abolition did not increase actual time served, because prisons
became so crowded that some inmates had to be released early.
</P>
<P>
   There is no statistical evidence that abolishing parole boards
has lowered crime rates in any state, the experts say. But they
acknowledge that keeping serious criminals in prison longer
undoubtedly prevents some crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Beck, chief of corrections statistics at the Bureau of
Justice Statistics, a branch of the Justice Department, said that
ending parole by itself ``has had no real impact on time served.''
Time served is going up everywhere, in states that still have
discretionary parole boards and states that have abolished them, he
said.

IN NEW DISCOVERIES, A PLANETARY MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Texas)   (bl)  
By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a stunning run of discoveries over the last
three years, astronomers have observed 17 nearby stars that appear
to be orbited by planets more or less the size of Jupiter. The most
recent detection of a planet around a star other than the Sun was
described here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But while astronomers continue the search for more such objects,
they have now seen enough to be puzzled by an emerging pattern:
None of these extrasolar planetary systems seems to resemble the
Sun's family of planets. Is this an observational fluke? Or is the
solar system a cosmic oddball?
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the American Astronomical Society, scientists
reviewed the mystifying evidence. All of these objects are found in
orbits much closer to their parent stars than Jupiter, the solar
system's giant, is to the Sun. Astrophysicists could only speculate
how such large planets, ranging in mass from one-half to 10 times
the mass of Jupiter, can orbit so close to a star and survive what
must be destabilizing gravitational stresses.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies reveal that many of the stars orbited by large
bodies typically have two to three times more heavy elements than
exist in the Sun. And except for the extrasolar planets extremely
close to their host stars, most of these objects appear to travel
in orbits unlike those of planets around the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we have enough extrasolar planets out
there to do some comparative study,'' said Dr. Geoffrey Marcy of
San Francisco State University, the leading discoverer of these
objects. ``We are realizing that most of the Jupiter-like planets
far from their stars tool around in elliptical orbits, not circular
orbits, which are the rule in our solar system.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcy noted that 9 of the 17 detected extrasolar planets sweep
relatively close to their stars and then swing far out again,
giving an oval shape to their orbital paths. The others travel in
more circular orbits, presumably because they are even closer to
their stars and are regulated by gravitational tides. One of these
is only four million miles from its star and takes only 4.2 days to
complete its revolution, or ``year.''
</P>
<P>
   An elliptical orbit was observed for the most recently
discovered extrasolar planet, around the star HD 168443 in the
constellation Serpens, the Snake. This new planet, Marcy reported
Friday, orbits its star once every 58 days at an average distance
that is nearer to the star than Mercury, with an 88-day orbit, is
to the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The eccentricity of the newly discovered planet _ the degree
that it deviates from a circular path _ is 0.54, about 10 times the
eccentricity in the orbit of most solar system planets.
</P>
<P>
   Theorists have proposed several possible explanations for such
eccentric orbits. When enough large planets orbit a star in
proximity, perhaps they generate a gravitational slingshot that
projects the planets into elongated orbits. Or perhaps a passing
star has upset the delicate balance of these planetary systems.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the planets could be perturbed because their star
is part of a binary system, where two stars are locked in
gravitational embrace.
</P>
<P>
   If elliptical orbits appear to be common for other planets as
massive as Jupiter, astronomers are wondering what different
circumstances in the solar system keep mighty Jupiter and Saturn in
circular orbits. It is not a trivial question, for the emergence of
life on Earth probably depended on the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter-size bodies plunging toward and away from their stars
are likely to sweep aside smaller worlds, sending them crashing
into the star or flying out of orbit into interstellar space.
Current technology is incapable of detecting Earth-size planets
around other stars, but they almost certainly could not exist near
their star's warmth in a system so unsettled by large planets in
wrecking orbits, Marcy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implications are also profound for the search for
extraterrestrial life,'' Marcy said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet of the all the Sun-like stars that have been studied so far
by planet seekers, only 5 percent have been found to have
Jupiter-mass planets in such eccentric orbits. Taking an optimistic
view, Marcy said that leaves 95 percent of stars that may be free
of these influences and could harbor habitable planets.
</P>
<P>
   Although nearly all astronomers agree that these detected
objects are extrasolar planets, a few holdouts are not so sure.
They have raised the possibility that these are brown dwarfs,
objects that formed like stars but lacked sufficient mass to
support nuclear fusion in their cores.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Cochran, an astronomer at the University of Texas in
Austin, said that too many of the objects had masses comparable to
Jupiter's for them to be brown dwarfs. But at the meeting, he
cautioned that they may not be planets, particularly because so
many of them have eccentric orbits and are so close to their stars.
They might be some new type of object unlike anything in the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``To find a new type of object would be an extremely exciting
result,'' Cochran said. ``Right now, we are still going to call
them `planets,' even though they may really be something slightly
different.''

CREATIVE COMPETITION BETWEEN HOUSE AND SENATE HEATS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a slip of the tongue, and not necessarily
Freudian. But after Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott referred to
Rep. Henry Hyde, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, as a senator Thursday, a careful observer could
practically see the steam rising from other senators' heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Hyde did not get elected over here,'' fumed Sen. Bob
Kerrey, D-Neb., drawing a sharp distinction between the House of
Representatives and the smaller, more exclusive club to which he
and Lott belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do a deal across the aisle,'' Kerrey said, referring to
the quest of Senate Democrats and Republicans for a bipartisan plan
for the trial of President Clinton. ``But we can't do a deal across
the Capitol.''
</P>
<P>
   As the trial of President Clinton opened last week, it laid bare
yet another rivalry and set of resentments, revealing that while
members of the House and Senate work in tandem and in sequence to
pass the nation's laws, they do not always work in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many House members, senators can be an aloof,
arrogant lot, too cavalier about foiling the House's best-laid
plans, too distracted by an inflated sense of themselves and their
responsibilities to roll up their starched sleeves and get anything
done.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many senators, House members can be impulsive,
intemperate adolescents desperately in need of the adult
supervision that the Senate so patiently provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House of Representatives was intended to be a raucous,
undisciplined reflection of public passions,'' said Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., on Friday. ``It's certainly fulfilled the
Founding Fathers' expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   As senators struggled through the week to come up with a plan to
avert a lengthy trial that would rummage anew through the details
of Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, it became clear
that some of them saw their task as mopping up the partisan mess
that they felt the House had left them.
</P>
<P>
   It also became clear that part of their investment in doing so
was the preservation of their image of themselves as a more
cool-headed convention. In speeches during the Senate meeting
Friday morning that led to an initial trial plan, senators said
that their body could not afford to let its reputation be dirtied
the way the House's had.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many Republican members of the House saw the
situation differently, and had already made clear that they
distrusted the Senate to focus on the charges against the president
as thoroughly as the House had.
</P>
<P>
   ``A senator's attention span is probably less than an average
juror's, so we'll have to simplify, simplify, simplify,'' said Rep.
Bob Barr, R-Ga., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, in an
interview about a week and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   Parliamentary rules laid down by Thomas Jefferson two centuries
ago, when he was vice president, forbid members of the two chambers
from sniping at each other, but that has never stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   They are simply too different to see eye to eye. Because the 435
members of the House represent smaller, narrower constituencies and
their two-year terms guarantee faster turnover, they form a more
diverse, flamboyant cast of characters than do the 100 senators,
with their six-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that comparison flatters the House or the Senate depends
on the vantage point of the person doing the comparing.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Panetta, a former congressman from California, recalled
that he had a very different view of the House of Representatives
when he first came to Washington as a legislative assistant in the
Senate in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole attitude of the Senate at that time was to look at
the House and consider them an unruly lynch mob,'' Panetta said in
a telephone interview Friday, adding that he shared that
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you're a member of the House,'' Panetta continued,
``you think: `I'm closer to the people, I know what people think,
I'm much more in touch with their concerns, and the Senate is the
high-minded body that's not really in touch.' Your mentality
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Panetta said that sometimes, when colleagues from the House left
to become senators, they suddenly upgraded their wardrobes and
shortened the circumferences of their social circles. ``It's the
difference between the East Side and the West Side of New York,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the rivalry between House members and senators can be
traced to the envy that many members of the former group feel.
Senators have bigger offices and more individual power.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other sources of animosity as well. Because House
members serve on fewer committees and have smaller staffs, they
often develop a more thorough mastery of a given subject than their
colleagues in the Senate, who can nonetheless scuttle their
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   But while the rivalry can be bitter, it can also be friendly,
and many lawmakers have a sense of humor about it, admitting to
aspects of the caricatures their rivals paint of them.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that senators, who would be constrained from making
statements during many phases of a trial, might not like ceding the
spotlight to prosecutors from the House, Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., said Friday, ``This may have the most salutatory effect on
moving the process expeditiously.''

JACQUES NEUVILLE, 82, FRENCH RESISTANCE HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., France)  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jacques Neuville, a forger for the French Resistance in World
War II who became a San Francisco department-store executive, died
on Dec. 29 at his home in Sausalito, Calif. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Neuville was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his wartime service
in the anti-Nazi underground in Lyons and Paris. He was born and
reared in Berlin as Guenther Neustadt, the child of a well-to-do
Jewish family in the clothing trade. As the Nazis took control of
Germany, he was sent by his family to Paris, where he studied
painting.
</P>
<P>
   He adopted a French version of his surname, changed Guenther to
Jacques and joined the French army. When his artillery unit was
overwhelmed by German forces, Neuville made his way to a Resistance
unit in Lyons and went to work forging the ration cards, passports,
and marriage and birth certificates that were used for false
identities.
</P>
<P>
   As he later told his family, he was betrayed to the Gestapo by a
woman who had occasion to go through his trouser pockets one night
and found many ration cards. He was in prison for six weeks until a
sympathetic French guard left doors open, allowing Neuville and
other prisoners to escape. He knocked at random on the window of an
apartment belonging to a woman named Jeanne Lilaze, who gave him
sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1940 he went to Paris, where he served in an underground
unit by working as a street and cafe portrait artist. When his
customers were German officers, he passed on what he learned in
conversation with them to the Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Neuville received the Croix de Guerre in 1946 and later received
a U.S. citation for providing information on pilots captured by the
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the war, he returned to Lyons and married
Christianne Lilaze, the daughter of the woman who had given him
refuge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, he began a marketing career in San Francisco. He later
became the merchandising manager at Macy's, where he helped to
develop a marketing concept called Macy's Fifth Floor, in which
disparate items like china, luggage and stationery were displayed
together. He retired in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters,
Charlotte Neuville, of New York, and Madeline Bohrer, of Salzburg,
Austria, and four grandchildren.

CLINTON REVIVES PROPOSAL TO EXPAND MEDICARE

   WASHINGTON _ In his new budget request, President Clinton will
again ask Congress to open Medicare to people 55 to 64 years old,
administration officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the proposal died in Congress last year, Clinton will
resubmit it, in part because he is concerned about the erosion of
private insurance coverage among people 55 to 64, the officials
said. Medicare now covers people who are 65 and older or who are
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people without health insurance rose by 4 percent
in 1997, to 43.4 million, the Census Bureau said. The number of
uninsured people age 55 to 64 rose more sharply, by 7 percent, to
3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they also intended to propose
cutbacks in Medicare payments to hospitals. The cuts, in the range
of $5 billion to $10 billion over five years, would reduce spending
by 1 percent to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said such cutbacks were justified
because a federal advisory panel had found that hospitals were
making relatively high profits on their Medicare business. The
panel, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, said last month
that hospital profit margins averaged nearly 16 percent on patients
admitted overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital executives said the figures were misleading because
one-fourth of all hospitals were losing money on their Medicare
inpatient business. And hospitals of all sizes said that they had
much lower profit margins on Medicare payments for outpatient
services.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., introduced a bill to carry
out Clinton's proposal to expand Medicare last year. Under that
proposal, people ages 55 to 64 could have bought Medicare coverage
by paying premiums of $300 to $400 a month. People 62 to 64 who
chose this option would also have had to pay surcharges on their
premiums after they reached the standard eligibility age of 65.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says the proposal is needed because
commercial insurance is often unavailable or unaffordable for
people age 55 to 64.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says its new proposal would cost $1.4 billion
over five years, and the Congressional Budget Office has made a
similar estimate. But some insurance experts said last year the
plan would not work in the long run because it would attract sicker
patients. As premiums were raised to cover the cost of such
patients, they said, healthier people under 65 would drop out, and
the program would lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who control Congress, have shown little interest in
Clinton's plan. But the idea of allowing more people to purchase
Medicare coverage will be seriously considered this year as
Congress weighs proposals to increase the eligibility age and
redesign Medicare.

<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. _ Five months pregnant, her belly just
beginning to show through the orange prison jumpsuit, Karen
Ptaschnik has become an unlikely lightning rod for the abortion
debate here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ptaschnik, a 30-year-old single mother of three young
children, is serving a 15-to-24-month sentence in the Luzerne
County jail for selling cocaine and driving with a suspended
license. This fall, when she told the prison authorities that she
was pregnant and wanted an abortion, they said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw it as an elective procedure, not the emergency or
necessary medical care we pay for,'' said Thomas Makowski, the
Luzerne County commissioner. ``Even though she said she would pay
for it herself, we weren't certain she could. We're elected to
represent a constituency, and this boils down to how you use
taxpayer money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ptaschnik went to court, with the help of New York
abortion-rights lawyers, and, in November a federal judge said that
the county must pay for abortions as a necessary medical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Although the case broke no new legal ground _ the federal
appeals court had previously upheld inmates' right to publicly
financed abortions _ here in this staunchly Catholic area it has
become a tangled saga of how abortion politics can play out far
from big-city clinics and Washington policy debates.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear precisely how Ms. Ptaschnik's request for an
abortion became public knowledge, but as word spread, it became
headline news, covered so extensively here and in Hazleton, her
hometown, that everyone in town seemed aware of the situation.
Bishop James Timlin of the Scranton diocese formally denounced the
court order.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, an abortion doctor seeking to practice here was kept
out after anti-abortion groups collected 100,000 signatures against
him. Anti-abortion sentiment runs just as strong in this old mining
center today: Ms. Ptaschnik's request brought taunts from fellow
inmates and harassment to her children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ptaschnik never had the abortion. At the Allentown Women's
Center, awaiting the procedure, she changed her mind, worn down by
months of harassment, she said, and beginning to feel the life
stirring within her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began asking for an abortion at four weeks,'' she said. ``At
that point it's not so real. But when you feel the baby move, it's
very real.''
</P>
<P>
   In prison and out, she and her children _ especially the eldest,
7-year-old Jayme _ were hounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone came up to Jayme and told her I was going to kill her
unborn baby brother or sister, and maybe I would kill her next,''
said Ms. Ptaschnik, who has been in prison for a year. ``There was
a baby doll with a knife in it left on our porch. And in my bunk,
someone left a baby-name book with a note saying `Choose a name for
your baby's grave.' People left me pictures of aborted fetuses.
There are no secrets in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not announce that she was still pregnant when she
returned to prison from the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked in, one of the girls got down on her knees, in
the middle of the kitchen, and said she prays for all the unborn
children,'' said Ms. Ptaschnik, who grew up in New York in a Jewish
family. ``The girls and the prison officials said that I don't
deserve to have babies, that I'm a good excuse for court-ordered
sterilization.''
</P>
<P>
   While the public debate is framed in terms of tax expenditures,
anti-abortion beliefs play a role: Makowski told one newspaper that
Ms. Ptaschnik's change of heart answered his prayers, and another
commissioner described himself and his colleagues as ``pretty
adamant pro-life supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ms. Ptaschnik's court order nor the fact that she is
having the baby, has entirely resolved the issue. Makowski says he
will still take inmate requests for an abortion to a judge. ``I'm a
lawyer, so I would never violate a court order,'' he said. ``But
every case is a different fact situation, and there are enough
nuances so I think we'd take each one back to court.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it really over for Ms. Ptaschnik. ``My children will
never have a fair chance here,'' she said. ``Parents tell their
kids things about me, and the kids aren't so nice to Jayme. She'd
just about cut off a limb for a friend right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ptaschnik said she agonized before deciding that an abortion
would be the best thing for her, her children and her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids need more attention from me, not less, and my mother
is having to take care of them, at a time of life when she should
be off doing whatever she wants,'' she said. ``I don't think
abortion is right or wrong. It's whatever a woman can live with. I
think it's important that I showed you don't lose your
constitutional rights just because you're in prison, but it all
should have been private.''
</P>
<P>
   The children live with Ms. Ptaschnik's mother, but on a recent
snowy day they were staying with Maureen Rousseau, who lives in the
other half of Ms. Ptaschnik's modest twin house and often cares for
the three children.
</P>
<P>
   Starting last August, because of good behavior, Ms. Ptaschnik
was allowed to go home each weekday to care for her children,
feeding them dinner before returning to the halfway house where she
and others on child-care or work release were allowed to do their
own cooking and laundry.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 14, at a hearing attended by her children and Ms.
Rousseau, Ms. Ptaschnik's child-care leave was revoked and she was
returned to the restrictions of the main prison building. She was
denied Christmas furlough, too, and has not seen her children since
the hearing, which she is convinced came in retribution for her
abortion battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a popular person around here,'' Ms. Ptaschnik said.
``They're furious that I took them to court on the abortion, and I
heard people say they were going to get me one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Bernard Brominski said he revoked the child-care leave
because the circumstances surrounding Ms. Ptaschnik's pregnancy had
not been satisfactorily explained.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, three days after Ms. Ptaschnik won child-care leave,
the father of her youngest child, himself in and out of jail,
appeared at her home, drunk. Unscheduled visits to a prisoner on
child-care leave are prohibited. But the man _ whom she describes
as the love of her life, although his beatings have landed her in
the hospital _ has visitation rights for his 2-year-old son, Jason.
</P>
<P>
   When he threatened violence, she said, she sent the children to
Ms. Rousseau. Ms. Rousseau said that Ms. Ptaschnik had not expected
the visit and had tried to keep the man out. He left only when the
police arrived and charged him with public drunkenness _ and only
after the sexual encounter that left Ms. Ptaschnik pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a big deal about how I didn't file rape charges,''
Ms. Ptaschnik said. ``But this is Jason's father. And when he's not
drunk, he's a wonderful man.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ptaschnik objected when prison officials sent Catholic
social services to counsel her about her pregnancy; she perceived
it as governmental meddling, not counseling. But she is now
gratefully accepting Catholic social services' aid with her legal
and medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say I should put the baby up for adoption, but I
could never do that,'' said Ms. Ptaschnik, whose earliest release
date is in May, right before the baby is due. ``I was adopted
myself, and you feel that if you're not good enough for your own
mother to keep, how can you be good enough for anything else in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   For some who oppose abortion, Ms. Ptaschnik's continuing
pregnancy seems a sort of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased she's having the baby,'' said Betty Caffrey
of Pennsylvanians for Life, adding that she still does not
understand the court ruling. ``I don't see why we as taxpayers
should be forced to be part of something we don't want. I don't
know where in Roe vs. Wade it says a prisoner can break her
sentence and go off and get an abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights supporters have asked the county for a policy on
handling future inmate abortion requests. And Makowski said the
prison board's lawyer is researching how state and federal prisons
handle the situation, looking for a way to keep from paying for
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers
Pennsylvania, ruled in a New Jersey case that inmates had a
constitutional right to an abortion. While a few other courts have
issued similar rulings, it is impossible to say how prisons
actually handle the situation, because so few cases come to light,
said Simon Heller, of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, a
New York advocacy group that represented Ms. Ptaschnik.
</P>
<P>
   But, Heller said, a Nov. 20 order by Judge Edwin Kosik of U.S.
District Court, that future requests for abortion be ``honored as a
necessary medical procedure,'' leaves no legal wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   Legal issues aside, Ms. Ptaschnik said, the whole mess has taken
a toll on her already messy life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm left in a worse situation,'' she said, ``and so are my
kids.''

NTSU MOKHEHLE, 80, EX-PREMIER OF LESOTHO
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Ntsu Mokhehle, who introduced the
former British protectorate of Lesotho to modern politics, died
Jan. 6 after falling ill during his 80th birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   He became sick Dec. 26 and died in a hospital in Bloemfontein,
South Africa, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The fractious Mokhehle was one of those responsible for
continuing political strife in tiny Lesotho, where several parties,
army factions and the royal family all competed for power in
periodic coups and army mutinies.
</P>
<P>
   He bears some responsibility for the standoff that led to
invasion by South Africa in September, during which rioting
destroyed much of the capital, Maseru.
</P>
<P>
   Mokhehle (pronounced mo-KAY-shlay), who was prime minister from
1993 until last year, founded the Basutoland Congress Party in 1952
and championed the cause of independence from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Lesotho (pronounced leh-SOO-too), traces its history to King
Moshoeshoe I, who in 1824 allowed tribes fleeing Zulu expansionism
to settle on his high plateaus if they helped defend them.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1830s on, hurling boulders down from his mountaintop
fortress, he fought off land-seeking Boer invaders until he saved
his remaining territory only by persuading the British Crown to
make it a protectorate in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Lesotho, a kingdom of 2 million encircled by South Africa,
gained independence in 1966. Mokhehle, who won election in 1960 as
head of the Basutoland Congress Party, would have been its first
ruler, but he was repeatedly thwarted by the Basutoland National
Party, led by Chief Leabua Jonathan, a canny puppet of apartheid
South Africa. Jonathan's unpopularity grew as he took away the few
powers granted to the Oxford-trained King Moshoeshoe II, crushed
dissent and tolerated corruption.
</P>
<P>
   From exile in Botswana, Mokhehle directed a guerrilla campaign
that filtered Libya-trained assassins in by way of the Johannesburg
mine workers' hostels, where many Sotho men lived.
</P>
<P>
   The Lesotho government responded with its own terror campaign,
using a police unit armed by South Africa. Jonathan, after flirting
with Havana and Moscow, was deposed by the army in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Transition to black majority rule in South Africa changed the
pressures on Lesotho, and elections in 1993 brought Mokhehle to
power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, in a new power struggle, he led his loyalists in
Parliament out of the governing party to found a new one, the
Lesotho Congress for Democracy, and called for new elections. His
name, Ntsu, means ``eagle,'' and voters signaled that they
supported him by flapping their arms like wings.
</P>
<P>
   The party won overwhelmingly last year, but the opposition cried
fraud. Their protests spread to the army, prompting South Africa to
invade to forestall another coup.
</P>
<P>
   Mokhehle was a colorful conversationalist who did not like to be
interrupted while he was answering questions with lectures on
African history and politics. A radio journalist who interviewed
him said last week that he ``never uttered a sentence that was less
than two minutes long.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE ODDEST COUPLE 
</HEADLINE>

 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To watch Jets receivers Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne
Chrebet play off each other, to watch them block for one another,
it seems apparent that they have a unique relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, they have been close all season, forming the most
prolific receiving tandem in the National Football League with a
total of 158 catches. Johnson made 83 of those receptions for 10
touchdowns and Chrebet made 75 for eight touchdowns. Each gained
more than 1,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they have been at the forefront of the Jets' evolution
from a 1-15 team two seasons ago into the 12-4 team that will play
the Jaguars in an American Football Conference Divisional Playoff
game Sunday at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship is indeed unique, but these two are not
joined at the hip, or anyplace else. Their common denominator is
quality play. They do their jobs, congratulate each other with a
tap _ never a hug _ dress silently at their adjacent lockers and go
their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the odd couple. It is the oddest couple.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson even declined to discuss his relationship with Chrebet.
Chrebet has no qualms talking about their football connection, and
dismisses as irrelevant the fact that they never talk about any
other part of their lives, nor see each other once the pads are
off.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that way since Johnson's rookie season in 1996 when
he joined the team as the NFL's top draft choice, instantly
declaring himself the team's top receiver.
</P>
<P>
   But it was after that season, when Johnson published his
breathless book _ ``Just Give Me the Damn Ball!'' _ that tension
between the two became apparent. The book was devoted to the
frustrations of playing for a 1-15 team and, in addition to
speaking of the failings of quarterback Neil O'Donnell, coach Rich
Kotite and the offensive coordinator Ron Erhardt, it labeled
Chrebet as the team's ``mascot.'' In fact, Chrebet is listed 17
times in the book's index, prompting Chrebet to once say, ``I'm
flattered that he's so obsessed with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the book's publication widened the distance
between the pair. And yet, somehow, it does not seem to have
affected the team when the two are out on the field together.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, something has happened in recent weeks that makes it
seem as if these fellows aren't as far apart as some people think _
or as they think.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Chrebet has begun talking as a confident,
I-want-the-ball kind of player. And Johnson, with steamrolling
success that includes his first Pro Bowl selection, has joined
Chrebet as the consummate team player.
</P>
<P>
   Don't invite them to the same party just yet. Here is Chrebet,
short _ he likes to think of himself as standing 5 feet 10 inches _
and muscular, wearing T-shirts and jeans and his old college cap.
Who even knew about this guy when he showed up in 1995 out of
Hofstra, whose national acclaim as a football power was somewhat
less than Southern Cal's?
</P>
<P>
   If the Jets' depth chart had gone that deep, Chrebet would have
been listed as the No. 10 receiver. But with his extraordinary
ability to hold on to the ball, to run exquisitely precise routes,
to be fearless over the middle, Chrebet blossomed into a big-league
receiver with 66 catches in his first season, the second-most among
NFL rookies.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, along came Johnson. He made his own depth chart.
He was the first player chosen in the entire draft, the all-America
out of USC, whose team he had led to a Rose Bowl victory with 12
catches.
</P>
<P>
   Before he had even signed a Jets contract, he donated his USC
jersey to the Official All Star Cafe in Times Square. He came
equipped with an Adidas contract, as well as the book deal, and
knew who Giorgio Armani was.
</P>
<P>
   As the Jets' fate would have it, the pair was squeezed together
in a corner of the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   There would sit Chrebet, usually dressing quietly, face down
toward his open locker. Alongside, towering over everyone at 6 feet
3 inches, Johnson would be holding court for the news media. Camera
operators, photographers and reporters of all kinds would push past
Chrebet to surround Johnson, the loudest _ and probably most
talented _ rookie the Jets had seen since the days of Joe Namath.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the two go well beyond football. While
Chrebet was raised in the suburbs in Garfield, N.J., the son of a
Vietnam veteran, Johnson grew up in Los Angeles amid troubled
circumstances. He once spent a few nights with his mother sleeping
in a car when there was a family dispute over the ownership of an
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   He spent time in a correctional facility as a teen-ager after
committing a series of street crimes. But he not only went to USC,
he graduated. He is proud of that degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always told me I wouldn't be able to do certain
things,'' Johnson said. ``I keep doing them.''
</P>
<P>
   People have forgotten about his criminal infractions. It took
longer to make others forget about his book.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Chrebet was asked this week about his relationship
with Johnson, he said: ``I'm always surprised when people ask
whether I block for him or he blocks for me. Of course we do.
There's not even a question about it. I compliment him when he does
something well and he does the same for me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Glenn Foley, who began this season as the Jets starting
quarterback and has regularly worked out in the off-season with
Chrebet, is certain that it would show if either player carried
negative feelings about the other onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything negative on the field,'' Foley said.
``It would be obvious, believe me. I saw it in college. But
whatever their problems are, if any, they're both professional. You
never see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hayes, a defensive back and special teams' star who rooms
with Johnson on the road, said Johnson never talks badly about
Chrebet. He said Johnson is high-strung before a game, getting only
four or five hours' sleep, and sometimes wakes up Hayes to discuss
plays with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Keyshawn's style is to be the go-to guy,'' Hayes said.
``But anything happens on the field, he compliments Wayne. I never
heard Keyshawn say anything bad about Wayne. He thinks Wayne's a
good player. I think they'll both be remembered for what they've
done with the Jets. Keyshawn's a tough big guy, Wayne's a tough
little guy. Both love the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while this season, Chrebet's jersey was the best-selling
item in the National Football League catalog. In recent weeks,
Johnson's has overtaken it, perhaps because of his Pro Bowl
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is taking some receivers to Hawaii as guests for the
game; Chrebet is going at Vinny Testaverde's invitation. But
Chrebet said that is merely because he and the quarterback had made
a pact: If either one was selected to play in the Pro Bowl, the
other would go as his guest.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Chrebet and Johnson will be together after all when
the season ends. They simply will be making separate reservations.

MARLINS: ON THE WAY BACK UP?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   These names are known little, if at all, beyond their own
households, but they have something in common: Armando Almanza,
A.J. Burnett, Joe Fontenot, Braden Looper, Rafael Medina, Jesus
Sanchez, Ramon Castro, Derrek Lee.
</P>
<P>
   This group has something in common, too: Jorge Fabregas,
Guillermo Garcia, Preston Wilson. So do these two: Justin Speier,
Kevin Orie.
</P>
<P>
   The first group is players the Florida Marlins acquired in
trades for players who were on their 1997 World Series championship
team. The second group is players the Marlins obtained for other
players they had received in deals for players who were on their
1997 world championship team.
</P>
<P>
   The last two players? The Marlins got them in a swap for one
player who was on their 1997 World Series championship team and one
player they acquired for a player who was on their 1997 World
Series championship team.
</P>
<P>
   All 13 of these players have one more thing in common: They are
on the Marlins' 40-man major league roster that this week will
become the property of John Henry, the man on whose watch the
Marlins will rise to the heights they enjoyed for a split second 15
months ago, or fall _ well, they can't really fall any farther than
they have.
</P>
<P>
   When Henry is approved by the major league owners at their
meeting in Carlsbad, Calif., this week, he will replace the
expansion franchise's original owner, H. Wayne Huizenga, who played
havoc with the Marlins' fans' emotions.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Craig Counsell crossed home plate with the
Series-winning run in the 11th inning of the seventh game in 1997
than Huizenga was plotting the dismantling of the championship
team. He didn't do the dirty work himself. That's what he was
paying Dave Dombrowski, his general manager, to do.
</P>
<P>
   He also had paid Dombrowski to build an instant winner, and
Dombrowski did an admirable job, hiring Jim Leyland to manage, and
signing in the space of a year Moises Alou, Bobby Bonilla, Devon
White, Al Leiter, Alex Fernandez, Kevin Brown and Livan Hernandez
as free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The returns are not in on the job Dombrowski has done in
demolishing Huizenga's team. He got rid of all of the high-priced
players, which is what his boss directed him to do, but it is
premature to judge the value of the players the Marlins received in
return.
</P>
<P>
   Dombrowski has traded 17 of the 25 members of the World Series
team, the most recent, shortstop Edgar Renteria, just four weeks
ago, a few weeks after the Marlins learned he was eligible for
salary arbitration. In return for those 17 players, the Marlins
received 27 young and inexperienced players.
</P>
<P>
   Dombrowski turned around and traded 7 of those 27 for 10 other
players. After selling one player and losing another in last
month's minor league draft, the Marlins have a net of 28 players
from the largest-scale destruction of a championship team since
Pharaoh's soldiers drowned in the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of the 28 players, seven of them pitchers, are on the
Marlins' 40-man roster. Three are expected to be in the 1999
starting lineup: first baseman Lee (one of three players acquired
for Brown), third baseman Orie (one of three players obtained for
Felix Heredia and Steve Hoff, who had also been in the Brown trade)
and catcher Fabregas (swapped for Oscar Henriquez, who was one of
three in the Alou deal).
</P>
<P>
   Two are expected to be in the starting pitching rotation:
Sanchez (one of three received for Leiter) and Medina (the third
player in the Brown swap).
</P>
<P>
   How good are these or any of the other young substitutes?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to assess some of those guys,'' a personnel expert
with another club said. ``Some of those players they got in trades
were rushed to the majors because of the void left by the trades.
Derrek Lee is a perfect example. If he was in Triple-A last year,
people would be saying he's a superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who had a solid but not spectacular season in Class A the
year before, batted only .233 for the Marlins, 60 points below his
cumulative minor league average.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez was another player who was in the major leagues last
season because the Marlins needed him. Bypassing the Class AAA
level of the minors, Sanchez had a 7-9 record for the Marlins. He
could have used the year to better advantage at AAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone they got is a great player,'' the executive said.
``I'm sure there will be some who will be legitimate everyday
players, maybe a couple of star-type players. They have guys who
were highly thought of in other organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the organization's top 10 prospects, as rated by the
publication Baseball America, are players the Marlins received in
those trades. That's a good sign if the Marlins are viewed as
having a strong organization otherwise, and they are.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the top four prospects are trade acquisitions, led by
Burnett, another pitcher the Marlins got in the Leiter deal.
Burnett, who just turned 22, had a 10-4 record and a 1.97 earned
run average in Class A last season.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in a two-week span, the Marlins traded away
the two pitchers they got from Houston for Alou, Henriquez and
Manuel Barrios. They actually traded Barrios a second time, having
sent him to Los Angeles in the Mike Piazza deal, then claimed him
off the waiver wire.
</P>
<P>
   When the Marlins got Henriquez, they thought the big
right-hander would someday be their closer, but he gained too much
weight and lost too much velocity on his fastball, a deadly
combination.
</P>
<P>
   It is this type of unpredictability with young players that
Henry, the new owner, is inheriting. He has been reluctant to talk
about the Marlins until he is approved as the owner, but he has
acknowledged some of the problems he faces, including the team's
credibility with fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it, it's going to be a major undertaking, a
very big challenge, to try to win back the fans,'' said Henry, a
49-year-old commodities trader, who must sell his slightly more
than 1 percent share of the Yankees. ``They've been angered.
They've been upset, first by the dismantling of the team and then
the loss of the All-Star Game. I have a lot of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins were supposed to be host to the All-Star Game in
2000, but Major League Baseball felt uneasy about circumstances in
south Florida and put the Marlins further back in line, giving them
time to get a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a necessity,'' Henry said, ``and it's going to
determine whether or not the Marlins will be able to compete. There
will be other things, but that will be a primary factor.''
</P>
<P>
   A new stadium will be one of Henry's first priorities, right
there with building a winner and winning back the fans. Those fans
may want to note that unlike H.Wayne, the initial in Henry's name,
W., comes after John, not before.

EDITORIAL: CAPITOL COUPLES
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 10:
</P>
<P>
   Think of ``Profiles in Courage'' or ``Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington,'' and you have a popular image of the Senate: a place
where principled individualism and collective deliberation reign.
The daily reality usually falls short of the idealized images. But
Friday's accord on the rules for the impeachment trial of President
Clinton did offer a stirring picture of divergent ideologies
blending together for the greater good. The odd-couple cliche got a
heavy workout in news stories about the sudden flowering of
bipartisan comity.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is the Senate was guided to its goal by the forming
of several striking partnerships: Trent Lott and Tom Daschle, Slade
Gorton and Joseph Lieberman, Phil Gramm and Edward Kennedy. It is
worth pondering how and why these tandems formed around the common
goal of saving a political institution from itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we have acted in the very best tradition of the
Senate,'' said Lott, the majority leader, in announcing a plan to
finesse the witness issue, which will move the Senate toward its
proper goal of censuring Clinton for lying under oath. Lott
credited Robert Byrd, the keeper of the lares, with a timely
invocation of the burden of Senate history.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Lott and the minority leader, Tom Daschle, who mixed
the glue. They made a striking pair, Lott looking starched, pressed
and polished, yet with an unmistakable glint of anxiety in his eye.
He had opened himself to intramural attack by saying he wanted the
Senate trial to be short and credible.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Daschle looked like a rumpled survivor of an
all-night poker game. He was, in fact, playing the only hand he
could, the threat to withdraw the bipartisan approach Lott craved,
and he won a bigger pot than the White House had any right to
expect. The Lott-Daschle rules will make it extremely hard for the
House prosecutors to put on live testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Lott nominated Gramm and Kennedy as the most unlikely team. A
rock-hard critic of Clinton and an early exponent of a full trial,
Gramm is also a stickler for Senate rules. He probably liked the
fact that these rules allow the GOP to look generous while leaving
room to ram through witness summonses if war breaks out. As a
Senate veteran, Kennedy had the experience to recognize the best
possible deal when it came. As a liberal icon, he could provide
cover for other Democrats to grab it.
</P>
<P>
   On the House side and in the most conservative corner of the
Senate, Republican partisans still hope that a parade of witnesses
will at last break the spell of the president's popularity and
convince the public that he should be tossed instead of
reprimanded. Among some Democrats, there lingered the belief that
Clinton could survive a vote on removal and escape without any of
the punishment he deserves. Managing these delusions has been the
job of the pioneer odd couple, Gorton and Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has a hard-knuckle reputation that forced other
Republicans to take him seriously as a conciliator and as an
in-house envoy on behalf of Lott's plan to avoid a long, detailed
trial. Lieberman brought an interlocking credibility as the first
important Democrat to voice stinging, moral criticism of the
president's personal conduct and betrayal of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a set of such formidable pairings, certain conditions
were required. Given its history, there is one force that always
trumps partisanship in the Senate. That is the desire to make both
the White House and the House look shortsighted and craven.
</P>
<P>
   The next election also played a big role. The Democrats are
willing to defend a presidency they regard as a burden in order to
get calmer seas before 2000. Among Republicans, 13 of the 19
senators up for re-election in the year 2000 come from states
carried by Clinton in 1996. Lott clearly fears he could lose the
Senate if a trial became a free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, everyone who rallied to history and to duty also
harbored dreams of victory and dreams of defeat. Such dreams are
the stuff that deals are made of.

MEXICO'S ELECTION PANEL SEES PARTY REVENGE IN BUDGET CUT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The government agency hit hardest by recent budget
cuts was the autonomous institution that organizes Mexico's
elections, some of whose officials say the governing party
engineered the cuts in reprisal for a decision to investigate
President Ernesto Zedillo's 1994 campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as
the PRI, have denied that the budget reductions, at the Federal
Electoral Institute, were politically motivated. They note that a
conservative opposition party also approved the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the 17 percent reduction in the agency's 1999
budget, a cut nearly three times that suffered by any government
ministry, came after a two-month campaign by the PRI that portrayed
the institute as a wasteful agency that squanders taxpayers' money
on endless tinkering with electoral lists and other democratic
frills.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the institute has overseen honest elections that
have broken with decades of PRI-administered fraud, and Zedillo has
basked in international praise because of the democratic advances.
</P>
<P>
   But since November, when the agency's nine-member governing
council authorized an investigation of the PRI's financing of its
1994 election campaigns, including Zedillo's presidential campaign,
the PRI has switched course dramatically, attacking the institute's
impartiality and the integrity of several of its top officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI senses that it can no longer control the institute,
and with an eye to the presidential elections in 2000, is trying to
weaken it and diminish its credibility,'' said Alberto Aziz Nassif,
a professor who studies Mexico's political transition.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, which was established in 1990, was initially
headed by successive interior ministers, all from the PRI. But
since 1996 it has been autonomous.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the agency requested $240 million to finance
operations this year, when it must prepare the national voter list
for next year's presidential balloting. But the Congress cut the
request by 17 percent, approving only $200 million. The institute's
budget has declined steadily since 1994, when Congress appropriated
nearly $600 million to organize presidential elections. In 1998 the
budget was $232 million.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview the institute's president, Jose Woldenberg, a
former professor who has carefully nurtured a reputation for
political neutrality, called the budget cut disproportionate,
noting that no cut of more than 6.6 percent was made in the request
of any government ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very large reduction,'' Woldenberg said.
``Every area of our operations will be affected.'' Nonetheless, he
expressed confidence that with careful stewardship, the agency will
organize credible presidential elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Zebadua, one of the agency's nine governing counselors,
who has often defended opposition points of view, said the budget
cut was part of a campaign aimed at weakening the institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real reason for the institute's current travails is that
we have established a strict political independence,'' Zebadua
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the clearest demonstration of that independence came
last fall, when the institute approved a new investigation of the
PRI's 1994 campaign expenditures. The party challenged the legality
of the investigation, arguing that the institute had approved the
1994 campaign spending reports in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution argued before
the institute that a new investigation was warranted.
Constitutional reforms in 1996 had strengthened the agency's
investigative powers, it said, and new evidence had emerged last
year during a national banking scandal that added to suspicions of
possible financial wrongdoing by the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   In November, after the institute approved the new investigation,
Enrique Ibarra, the PRI's representative, walked out of the
proceedings and has refused to take part in institute business
since then. The party took its challenge of the new investigation
to an electoral tribunal, but last month the tribunal upheld the
legality of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ibarra said there was no connection between the
the party's criticisms of the agency and the decision in Congress
by the PRI and the conservative National Action Party December to
cut the institute's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot interpret this as revenge-seeking, because National
Action party deputies voted with us on these cuts,'' he said.
``This was a shared decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Alcantara, a National Action Party deputy, said his
party's priority had been to avoid tax increases, which forced
National Action to support painful cuts not only at the institute
but at many other government agencies.

SPECULATING ON AMERICA'S CUP CHALLENGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Md., Hawaii)  (jw) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's Cup yacht racing has taken on an immediacy with the
beginning of the new year. Challengers are scrambling to get their
sailboats built in time for autumn trial races in New Zealand. But
observers are speculating on which teams will make it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Two national yachting magazines, one English, the other
American, recently published predictions of which teams would
prevail. But already the reshuffling has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dennis Conner announced that his America's Cup
program was taking over Team Caribbean, the yachting syndicate that
Peter Holmberg founded in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Caribbean
team was unable to raise enough money to support a viable America's
Cup effort.
</P>
<P>
   Holmberg, meanwhile, will compete with Conner aboard his new
Stars &AMP; Stripes, the traditional boat name for Conner's cup
contender. Sailing as helmsman on Stars &AMP; Stripes will be Ken Read,
a two-time national yachtsman of the year. As with his cup campaign
of 1995, Conner will manage the team, but still sail.
</P>
<P>
   Conner's cup merger leaves 15 teams of the original 16 that each
invested $350,000 in performance bonds to compete in the Louis
Vuitton Challenge Selection Series.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of that four-month set of trials, which begins Oct.
18 in Auckland, will sail against Team New Zealand, defender of the
America's Cup. The cup match between the final two boats _
challenger and defender _ begins Feb. 19, 2000. In the meantime,
more campaigns are likely to falter _ even before the challengers'
trials begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a couple of side bets with people,'' said Dyer Jones,
president of the America's Cup Challengers' Association, during a
recent trip to New York. ``The numbers range from 9 or 10 through
12. I'd be very happy if we had 12 in the Louis Vuitton Cup. I
certainly see weaknesses with some of the teams, as many others
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the February issue of Sailing World magazine, to be mailed to
subscribers this week, the cup challenge teams are broken into
three tiers.
</P>
<P>
   The first set, the ones considered most likely to succeed at
becoming challenger, are listed in order: first, Prada, the team
from Italy; second, Young America, the New York Yacht Club group;
third, Nippon, the Japanese team, and fourth, America One, the
campaign founded in San Francisco by Paul Cayard.
</P>
<P>
   The projections were made by Gary Jobson, a veteran of five cup
campaigns who is now ESPN's America's Cup commentator. ``New
Zealand is for sure the favorite to win the America's Cup series,''
Jobson said in a telephone interview last week from Annapolis, Md.
``They have the funding, and they are testing like crazy, both off
and on the water.''
</P>
<P>
   In his assessment of the six (now five) U.S. teams, Jobson
wrote: ``At the minimum, the Americans should freely scrimmage with
each other, for at the moment, American prospects are not strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Seahorse, a British magazine, came out with an article in
December by Rod Davis, a former America's Cup helmsman who is now a
coach for Prada.
</P>
<P>
   Davis omitted his own group from the assessment to avoid a
conflict of interest, but said, ``I would not be with a team that I
did not think would be in the hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating each of the other 15 challenge entries, he assigned
points based on sailing ability, funding, design work and the
x-factor, his gut feeling about potential.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, like Jobson, gave Team New Zealand the best chance of
ultimately winning the America's Cup races. As the sole defense
team, he gave the Kiwis 19 points.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among challengers, he ranked Cayard's America One team next,
with 17 points. Third was the New York Yacht Club's team, with 16
points, and in a tie for fourth, with 14 points each, were America
True, the team of men and women founded by Dawn Riley in San
Francisco, and Team Aloha Racing, the Hawaiian syndicate founded by
John Kolius.
</P>
<P>
   Conner scoffed last week at the rankings, noting that boat
design would make the final difference. ``Rod Davis can have all
the conjecture in the world,'' Conner said. ``But it will all come
down to who has the fastest boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the underdog, in fact, has worked well in the past. Ed
Baird, skipper for New York's Young America team, pointed out
recently that Team New Zealand was considered a dark horse before
the 1995 cup races, then won. Baird should know; he was the Kiwi
team's coach then.
</P>
<P>
   ``They loved it, because it took the attention off them and the
pressure off them,'' Baird said. ``Now they're in a very different
position.'' &QL;

SEX JOINS LIST OF TOPICS IN SALT LAKE CITY INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Utah)  (bl)  
By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ As reports of cash payments, a land deal,
tuition aid and excessive gift-giving continued to flow in a
torrent last week, it seemed inevitable to some Olympic officials
that the issue of sex would surface in the bribery scandal
involving the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The providing of sexual favors for members of the International
Olympic Committee is one of the oldest and most persistent rumors
of the bidding process on the Winter and Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the office of Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt acknowledged
to reporters that an internal ethics panel of the Salt Lake Olympic
Organizing Committee was investigating allegations of prostitution,
including whether credit cards belonging to the bid committee were
used to pay for escort services for IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be enormously disheartening if it is true,'' Leavitt
said in an interview with a Salt Lake City television station.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations have not been substantiated, Olympic officials
said, and may prove to be nothing more than rumors. Dick Pound, an
IOC member from Montreal, said Saturday that the issue had not been
raised in his investigation of the IOC's involvement in the Salt
Lake City scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not anything we've seen like that,'' Pound said.
``They can't even get their own dates? If it happened, it will all
come out.''
</P>
<P>
   If the allegations proved true, they would be particularly
embarrassing in this community of conservative values and Mormon
rectitude and would lend further charges of hypocrisy to the
pristine Olympic ideal of elevating humanity through sport.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has reiterated that it would not take the 2002 Games
away from Salt Lake City, and that seems unlikely to happen at this
moment, both for logistical reasons and because most of the
corporate sponsors supporting the Olympic movement are located in
the United States. But the investigation of prostitution is certain
to fuel the debate about whether the people of Utah want these
Games anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The bribery scandal has already left organizers nervous about
whether eroding corporate support will leave them short of their
$1.45 billion budget and force them to scale back the Games.
Taxpayers are worried about being saddled with any financial
burdens, and a community that put forward one of the best Winter
Olympic bids ever in terms of sports facilities and infrastructure
has now been left with a feeling of embarrassment and betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   An inflammatory issue like prostitution could turn a brush fire
of public discontent into a bonfire, said Salt Lake City
Councilwoman Deeda Seed, who has begun to question whether the
Games should be held here. ``The people of our community would be
so horrified by that, that they may not want to have anything to do
with the Olympics ever again,'' Seed said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the escort service investigation, as well as
acknowledged wrongdoings such as direct cash payments as high as
$70,000 to IOC members, Seed said: ``It's quite appalling. It goes
against all the values of this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Seed added: ``Basically, what's unfolding here is evidence that
the people who were working to secure the Olympics for Salt Lake
City would stop at nothing. They would sell out every value the
community holds dear. That is so unacceptable and so horrifying. We
will have to deal with the consequences for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the top two local Olympic organizers, Frank Joklik and
Dave Johnson, submitted their resignations after more evidence of
wrongdoing by the bid committee became known. &QL;

NIGERIANS VOTE IN 2ND STEP TO CIVILIAN RULE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Casting ballots on sidewalks, under trees, at
construction sites, next to a man selling yams, in garages and
countless other neighborhood spots, Nigerians elected governors and
state legislators Saturday in voting that is the second step in the
military government's plan to restore civilian rule by May.
</P>
<P>
   The streets in this city of 7 million people were deserted of
cars, as drivers were kept off roads and people walked to voting
areas. Nigeria's borders were sealed during voting hours, the most
dramatic of many steps taken to prevent ``magomago,'' or
vote-rigging in Nigerian slang.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in 35 of Nigeria's 36 states should give foreign
monitors further evidence of how fair next month's presidential
elections will be. Furthermore, the results should provide clues to
whether an emerging alliance between two of the three parties can
check the seemingly inevitable rise of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo to
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Elections were canceled in Bayelsa state in the Niger Delta
region in the South after more than 20 people were killed in recent
riots. The Delta produces Nigeria's oil, but the country's Northern
military rulers have left the region desperately poor.
</P>
<P>
   It was too early to estimate voter turnout in this country of
108 million, although visits to several polling places in Lagos
suggested that turnout was low. Results in the races were not
expected until Sunday at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   In Lagos, under a sky made hazy by the harmattan winds that have
been blowing down sands from the Sahara, voting appeared largely
peaceful. Violence erupted in at least one neighborhood, however,
when a group of men brandishing bottles and knives invaded a
polling place in Isale Eko, broke open four ballot boxes and
destroyed the cards, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, officials at polling places seemed better organized
than in December's municipal elections, when many showed up late
and did not have enough voting materials. Officials seemed to have
addressed one of the chief criticisms of last month's process: lack
of privacy. On Saturday, voters entered makeshift booths or ducked
under curtains hanging over tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any cause to complain about the process,'' said
Peter Olusegun, who was monitoring a site for the All People's
Party, a right-of-center grouping that is one of three parties to
have emerged strongly from December's elections. ``I have not
recorded any cases of cheating or malpractice. Things appear to be
better organized this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   The West African nation has experienced a bewildering six-month
period, which began with the unexpected deaths of its longtime
dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, and its most revered opposition leader,
Moshood K.O. Abiola. It also has included sweeping political
reforms, ruinous unrest in the Delta region and the collapse of
worldwide oil prices.
</P>

<P>
   Saturday, even typically skeptical residents of Lagos expressed
optimism about Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you vote and elect the person you want,'' said Idris
Elegushi, 18, at a polling place in Lagos, ``Nigeria will change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting clearer in their minds about what they
want, and it's also getting clearer in people's minds that the
military will really hand over power,'' said Sinatu Ojikutu, a
former lieutenant governor of Lagos state and a member of the
centrist People's Democratic Party, which won 60 percent of votes
cast in December's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians voted six months after the death of Gen. Abacha, who
ruled Nigeria for five years, stole billions of dollars in oil
revenues and turned the country into an international pariah for
abusing human rights. The military has ruled Nigeria, the world's
sixth-biggest oil producer, for all but 10 years since gaining
independence from Britain in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Abacha's successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, carried out
a series of well-received political and economic reforms, including
municipal elections last month.
</P>
<P>
   Election monitors from the West described last month's municipal
elections as generally free and fair. Nevertheless, they warned
that the independent agency holding the elections needed to improve
how ballots were cast and collected in Saturday's vote and, most
importantly, in the Feb. 27 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent National Electoral Commission warned in a
statement that the primaries leading up to Saturday's statewide
elections had been ``beset by all forms of irregularities,
intimidation and in some instances violence.'' Local and foreign
monitors who dispatched observers throughout the country are
expected to issue reports early next week.
</P>
<P>
   After last month's elections, three parties survived to present
candidates in the statewide and national races.
</P>
<P>
   Many leaders of the People's Democratic Party, which emerged
strongest in December's vote, include former political opponents of
Abacha. Chief among them is Obasanjo, who spent three years in jail
until Abubakar freed him in August.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo, who ruled Nigeria from 1976 to 1979 and gained lasting
esteem for being the only military ruler to hand over power to a
civilian government, is considered the leading presidential
candidate. He is the only one with nationwide recognition; even
though he is a Yoruba from the South, he is said to be trusted by
the Hausa-speaking military rulers from the North.
</P>
<P>
   The two other weaker parties, which occupy opposite ends of the
political spectrum, announced last week that they would present a
common candidate against Obasanjo in the Feb. 27 election.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Democracy, considered left-of-center and
strongest in the Yoruba southwest, includes former supporters of
Abiola, a Yoruba billionaire businessman who had appeared set to
win a presidential election in 1993 before the military annulled it
and imprisoned him. He died unexpectedly in prison last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The third party, the right-of-center All People's Party, has
been nicknamed ``Abacha People's Party'' for the presence of many
of the late general's allies. But its base in the North and East
means that a partnership with the Alliance for Democracy would make
strategic sense.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the two ideologically opposed parties have grown closer,
some members of Alliance for Democracy have tried to play down the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now looking at ways to cooperate,'' said Kofoworola
Bucknor-Skerele, the Alliance for Democracy's candidate for
lieutenant governor in Lagos state, as she waited at a polling
place under an almond tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not forming an alliance.''

EDITORIAL: AMERICA'S ROLE IN IRAQ (bl) 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 10:
</P>
<P>
   From the information so far disclosed about U.S. intelligence
activities in Iraq, it does not appear that Washington acted
improperly or misused the United Nations. But it is clear that the
international effort to monitor Iraq's development of
unconventional weapons will not resume in the form used over the
last seven years. That obliges the United States and its allies to
develop new methods to prevent Saddam Hussein from stockpiling
chemical and biological agents.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. spying in Iraq supported and was coordinated with the U.N.
weapons inspection program, which began after the Persian Gulf war
in 1991. It was designed to locate sites where toxic weapons were
being developed or stored, and to identify buildings that housed
records about such arms.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome elaborate Iraqi concealment schemes, U.N. inspectors
needed U.S. assistance, including sophisticated eavesdropping
devices that could intercept the radio and telephone communications
of Baghdad's security services. U.S. officials say the effort was
approved by top U.N. inspectors and that the intelligence data was
shared with them. That is a critical issue, for an effort to
deceive the U.N. or to conduct independent U.S. espionage
operations under U.N. cover would have abused Washington's
relationship with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensitive U.S. operation began last March, when an
American spy serving as a U.N. inspector traveled to Baghdad to
install especially advanced listening equipment. If this operation
was authorized by the U.N. team, and employed for its benefit, as
U.S. officials say it was, the effort was a perfectly reasonable
response to Iraq's attempts to thwart the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   With the encouragement of Iraq and its friends, the Security
Council is now arguing over the U.S. role rather than dealing with
the urgent issue of how to prevent Saddam from rearming. Richard
Butler, who has done a commendable job as the chief U.N. inspector,
should not be sacrificed nor should his team be dismantled.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan must resist the notion that Washington
and Butler somehow conspired to wrong Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up with new ways to deal with Iraq will not be easy, but
several principles are paramount. Baghdad must not be allowed to
build a new arsenal of unconventional weapons or threaten neighbors
with them. Lifting the oil embargo, a move favored by Russia and
France, would be a grave mistake, giving Saddam an unlimited
revenue stream that he would undoubtedly use for military purposes.
The United States and Britain, however little support they receive
on the Security Council, must not waver in their commitment to
restrain Iraq.

FLORENDO VISITACION, 88, MARTIAL ARTS MASTER
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)  (bl)  
By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Florendo M. Visitacion, who built upon childhood
experiences in a rural Philippine village to develop and promote
his own eclectic and well-known system of martial arts in New York,
died Jan. 4 at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Justice Laura Visitacion Lewis of the New York
state Supreme Court, said he had recently entered the hospital from
the Kateri Residence, a nursing home on Riverside Drive, after
suffering a sudden drop in blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Standing 5 feet 2 inches and never weighing more than 125
pounds, Visitacion, who was known within the martial arts community
as Professor Vee, hardly inspired dread in street clothes. Indeed,
he never wore any insignia of his status on the street and he
cautioned his followers to avoid flamboyance and to dress modestly.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the dojos (where well into his 60s he would regularly
throw much younger, highly skilled men to the floor) his authority
as a teacher and a founder of a martial arts system was apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an oxymoron, a gentle martial artist,'' said his
daughter. ``I would watch as he taught a particularly lethal form
of self defense. He would not only disarm and throw his opponents
but then he would go on to show how they might be killed in six
different ways. And meanwhile he was a gentle and peaceful man who
loved books. `The truly powerful,' he would tell me, `are those who
are also restrained.' Those are words I often think of as a
judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Florendo Visitacion was born June 11, 1910, the son of
sharecropper peasants on the island of Ilocos Norte in the
Philippines. It was not uncommon for practitioners of various
schools of self defense to teach their techniques as they traveled
through the countryside; it is from such wandering tutors that
Visitacion learned basic skills. At 16 he left home for Hawaii,
where he cut sugar cane. Two years years later he moved to
Stockton, Calif., to work as a grape picker.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, he followed the crops and traveled within the
large Filipino community of California, continually studying
martial arts disciplines including jujitsu, escrima, or knife
fighting, and arnis, or stick fighting. At the outset of World War
II, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served as a medic.
</P>
<P>
   After his discharge, Visitacion came to New York, where he
obtained a high school diploma and took some college courses.
Decades before the martial arts boom that would crest along with
the popularity of Bruce Lee films, he sought out a variety of
teachers, notably Charles Nelson, a specialist in unarmed combat,
Kiyose Nakae, a jujitsu master, Jerome Mackey, a judo champion, and
Swami Vragiananda, a proponent of an Indian school of fighting
called Varmannie.
</P>
<P>
   From all these traditions as well as those he had studied
earlier he forged a discipline that he referred to as a system of
systems; he called it Vee-jitsu after himself, meaning the art of
Vee. He opened and closed a succession of martial art book stores
and dojos in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, and would often
take on disciples, sometimes without a fee, if they were
sufficiently dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, his form of martial art was recognized as a distinct
discipline by the American Judo and Jujitsu Federation. He was
awarded a 10th-degree black belt based on his demonstration of
Vee-jitsu and given the title of professor. He later resigned from
the organization, believing its discipline was too lax.
</P>
<P>
   By the time interest in martial arts soared, the aging teacher
had gained near legendary status and was referred to as Professor
Vee or Grandmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his arrival in New York, Visitacion married Heriberta
Bernabe Charbonnier, a native of Puerto Rico. They had three
children before they were divorced about 20 years ago. In addition
to his daughter, Justice Visitacion Lewis, and his former wife, he
is survived by two sons, Edward of Miami Beach and Bladimir of New
York, and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Visitacion's teachings went beyond physical movements involving
comportment and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he once said: ``If on a subway someone pushes you
or sprawls across two seats, you should not appear as if it
mattered. Understand the person's problem and walk away.
Confronting the person or even beating him up will not educate or
reform him, nor is it our place to do so.'' &QL;

ALLIES ARE COOL TO FRENCH PLAN FOR MONITORING IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France and Britain conferred last week on the next steps
to take in Iraq, but French officials said on Friday that wide
differences still separated them.
</P>
<P>
   France would like Britain and the United States to agree in the
U.N. Security Council to lift the oil embargo against Iraq if
President Saddam Hussein consents to a new system of international
arms monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The French proposal has met with little success with the allies
so far, and as a high-ranking French official said on Friday, there
was not yet any certainty that Saddam would agree to a permanent
control system.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China, also permanent members of the Security
Council, would have to approve as well.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain bombed Iraq last month after
Baghdad stopped cooperating with U.N. arms inspectors that the
Iraqis said were spies for the United States. Since then, the
United States has acknowledged getting information for the bomb
strikes from equipment the inspection teams used.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France discussed Iraq here
over breakfast on Friday with Britain's foreign secretary, Robin
Cook, but they made no statement afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British and the Americans at this point are insisting that
Iraq will be subject to continued bombing unless it agrees again to
inspections by United Nations Special Commission teams,'' a French
official said, referring to the arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Iraq no longer has any nuclear capability, and
large quantities of chemical and biological stocks, we know, have
been found and destroyed by the United Nations teams,'' the French
official said. ``We do not believe there is any point in going back
in and continuing to look for the last test tube, because we'll
never find it. What we need is a new system of continuous
monitoring that allows us to make sure Iraq does not try to build
new facilities to acquire these things again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the French view, such a system would include both television
cameras and expert inspections to keep an eye on suspected sites.
But the French believe that the special U.N. inspection commission,
which has been led by an Australian diplomat, Richard Butler, will
never again be acceptable to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   As an incentive to get Iraq to permit a new inspection system,
French officials said, the United Nations would lift the remaining
embargo against Iraqi oil exports but set up controls to make sure
Saddam did not spend any of the revenues on acquiring new weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But at this point, according to French officials, the United
States is unwilling to consider such ideas.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: BILLY GRAHAM, AND US, THEN AND NOW
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla.)  (bl)  
By DUDLEY CLENDINEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aunt Carolyn was my godmother, and one November night she phoned
to ask if I would go with her to hear the Rev. Billy Graham in
crusade on a day three months away. I couldn't say no. I was 16. My
calendar was clear for 1961. And Aunt Carolyn's determination was
well known.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, to people in Tampa, Fla., Graham had the fame of a
local boy. He had graduated from Florida Bible Institute, just
north of town. Aunt Carolyn adored him. She was a Southern
fundamentalist, an Alabama country Christian. The Bible was her
law, and his, and she liked the way he strode around, showering
damnation and redemption, calling people to come to Christ.
</P>
<P>
   My father, however, had become a city man in the years after
World War II, an Episcopalian like my mother. When the night came
for Graham to preach, in an old stadium on the river where my
high-school football team played championship games, and stock cars
races threw up dirt and thunder on summer nights, Dad went too. He
sat between us, to block me from the impulse to run down the
bleachers to answer Graham's altar call. Liking stock cars more
than preachers, I was relieved. But Aunt Carolyn looked
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Graham headed on to Fort Lauderdale, and larger places. He
preached in Madison Square Garden and Moscow, and almost 100
countries around the world, to more than 100 million people. He
spent too much time in Richard Nixon's White House, but regretted
it. This past year he turned 80, and two months ago he came back to
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   He and the city had changed. The new stadium was huge, with
video screens and commercial promenades to entertain the
professional-football fans, and separate them from their money. Up
and down the road were other stadiums where George Steinbrenner's
Yankees and other teams play, new car dealerships, television
stations, strip bars. Country Christians like Carolyn are now
mainly dead and gone. The shores of Tampa Bay swarm with new
suburbanites, many of them just as fervent, more of them
Republicans, leading tanned but fragmented, modern lives. Some of
my schoolmates, pillars of the city now, who had gone down to the
altar in 1961, did not attend this time. But in four nights, more
than 280,000 people did, filling the stadium and its infield.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people, boomers in their early 50s like me _ Carolyn's
age in 1961, Bill Clinton's now _ are feeling mortal these days .
Exhausted by the harsh judgmental combat in Washington, we yearn
for love and reassurance, some source of faith, wisdom and sweet
reason. And there, at the pulpit, still at center stage, is Billy
Graham. In the time he has been preaching, mega-preaching in the
form of televangelism has come of age, and some would say,
overreached its place. The public record of its preachers _
Southerners, mainly, like Graham _ has been stained by grapples
with sex, power and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But not Graham. He has never been involved in a scandal like
Jimmy Swaggart, or convicted of cheating his flock like Jim Bakker.
He has never played the moral autocrat like Jerry Falwell, run for
president or sold out his Family Channel audience to Rupert Murdoch
like Pat Robertson, or bullied Republican politicians like James
Dobson. It is partly in contrast that he looks so good.
</P>
<P>
   He is no Puritan. He simply preaches faith, and so people seek
him out. Thirty-eight years ago, in a stadium for 15,000 people, he
seemed big to me. Now, from the high seats in a stadium where the
Tampa Bay Bucs play Detroit, or Dallas or Denver, Graham seems an
old man, weakened by a decade of Parkinson's. Yet thousands of
people watched him on the video screens, straining to connect with
him, to be filled by his words.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that despite the physical work of the years, Graham
has stayed the same, and it is the need for his love and integrity
that has grown. It may be, in this splintered culture, that no one
can fill the pulpit he will leave whenever he goes.
</P>
<P>
   But other preachers and politicians should take note of the
qualities in him that people seem to reach for _ the tolerance, the
moral support rather than condemnation, the plainness, the
non-judgmental love. They are in very short supply right now, and
are sorely missed.

 &HT;    GOP set to convene with contributors in Florida
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Top Congressional leaders and governors
are coming here next week for three days of private meetings and
golf with six-figure contributors to the national Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   While the Senate trial of President Clinton gets under way,
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., is scheduled to be the keynote
speaker at a ``Team 100'' dinner Friday night at the Four Seasons
Resort, according to a Dec. 9 invitation letter from the Republican
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Team 100 are part of an exclusive club of
$100,000-plus contributors to the Republican Party. Members also
must contribute an additional $75,000 over a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the meetings took place at The Breakers hotel at
the same time that Congress was investigating questionable campaign
contributions to the Democratic Party. At the time, House Speaker
Newt Gingrich of Georgia cancelled his appearance because of the
controversy. Then he changed his mind, slipping in through a back
door and leaving the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is a staunch defender of big contributors. Lott says there
should be no limits on how much money someone can give a candidate.
He also opposes public financing of campaigns, calling it ``food
stamps for politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   The event begins Thursday evening with a dinner at a private
home featuring Gov. Jeb Bush, who spoke to the crowd two years ago,
and other GOP governors. Friday morning begins with meetings with
Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut and U.S. Rep. John Kasich of Ohio,
who is considering a run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, who heads the political consulting firm Century
Strategies, and Mike Deaver, a media strategist in the Reagan White
House, will discuss the outlook for the 2000 campaign. U.S. Rep.
Porter Goss of Sanibel, a member of the Intelligence Committee, and
William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, will discuss
national security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson and Mel
Sembler, a Tampa businessman and the RNC's finance chairman will
also privately brief the contributors on campaign strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's luncheon speakers will be Sens. Connie Mack of Florida
and Fred Thompson of Tennessee, who also is considering a campaign
for president. He chaired the Senate committee that investigated
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Most GOP members of the Florida delegation are expected to
attend at least part of the three-day event, which ends Saturday
with a golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   While the big money givers are at the Four Seasons Resort,
Republican Eagles, those who give $15,000, will be at the Breakers
Wednesday. Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who is a
candidate for president will speak to the Eagles during a welcoming
reception at the Breakers.
</P>
<P>
   Schedules for both groups were still being modified and the list
of speakers could change depending on what is happening in Congress
next week.

 &HT;    Controversial lie detector a `tremendous' help in Ohio
 &HT;    By Lou Grieco
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Law enforcement agencies across the country _ and
across the Miami Valley _ have nothing but praise for Computerized
Voice Stress Analyzer, a new type of lie detector: The innocent are
cleared. The guilty confess. Cases are closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous investigative tool,'' said Joseph Mahan,
chief deputy with the Miami County Sheriff's Office. ``It's been
quite effective for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also controversial. The FBI won't use the CVSA. Nor will
the Defense Department. Government scientists compare it to
flipping a coin.
</P>
<P>
   Manufactured by a former police officer who calls his 10-person
firm the National Institute for Truth Verification, the CVSA is
purported to be 98 percent accurate, according to company
literature.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the device is cheaper and easier to use than
traditional polygraph machines, can be used over the telephone or
television and even with tape recordings of people living or dead.
Drugs and medical factors that can throw off a polygraph don't
affect CVSA results, according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 law enforcement agencies across the nation have
bought the lie detectors and use them to interview suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of criminals, convinced that the machine would detect
their lies, have confessed to crimes of every description, the
manufacturer says. Other suspects reportedly have been cleared in
part because the CVSA concluded they were blameless.
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, a woman recanted her claim that she was raped. In
San Diego, detectives elicited a murder confession from teen-agers
in the death of a young girl. In Florida, a murderer confessed his
crime and implicated an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   But government scientists say the CVSA doesn't work. They
concluded: You'd not only get better results with a polygraph, you
could do better flipping a coin.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department, which considered the CVSA a potential
godsend in intelligence and international diplomacy, found in
laboratory studies an overall accuracy rate of 49.8 percent, or
slightly less than pure chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found no credible evidence ... that voice stress
analysis is an effective investigative tool for determining
deception,'' concluded Michael Capps, director of the Defense
Department's Polygraph Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Mahan nor Lt. Jerry Mays of the Warren County
Sheriff's Office have had problems with the machines. Both said
they have on occasion backed up the CVSA with a polygraph. Every
time, they say, where the CVSA has shown deception, the polygraph
has as well.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the polygraph nor the CVSA are admissible as evidence in
Ohio courts. Mahan noted that neither test can be forced on a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps lead us in the right direction,'' said Mahan. ``It is
nothing more than a mere investigative tool.''

 &HT;    Refuge land buy hampered by U.S. cash shortfall
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Eight months ago, Jon Starnes and several
partners agreed to sell 200 acres of hunting land in northwestern
Travis County to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   They are still waiting for the agency to come up with the cash.
And now it looks like they could be waiting a lot longer.
</P>
<P>
   The wildlife service, part of the Interior Department, is
getting nearly $4 million less from Congress this year for land
acquisition at the Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge
than the agency had requested and anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The refuge, which is in northwestern Travis, eastern Burnet and
southwestern Williamson counties, was established in 1992 to
protect the nesting habitat of two endangered songbirds, the
black-capped vireo and the golden-cheeked warbler. The government
has acquired 16,000 acres toward its 46,000-acre goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the same position as a lot of people out there,''
said Starnes, a financial consultant who lives in Austin. ``They've
convinced us to sell, but where's the money?''
</P>
<P>
   The wildlife service is getting $3.5 million this year for land
acquisition for the Balcones refuge. It had requested $7.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists are charging that Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison
(R-Texas), a longtime critic of the Endangered Species Act,
exercised an unwritten rule of privilege and reduced the request.
Lisette Mondello, a spokeswoman for Hutchison, said the senator did
nothing of the sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do anything on this,'' Mondello said. ``We didn't
get contacted by the local community people about this, like the
chamber and other groups.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, business leaders and conservationists in South
Texas have advocated aggressively for the Lower Rio Grande National
Wildlife Refuge. That refuge, extending upstream from the mouth of
the Rio Grande, protects brushland for rare cats and migratory
birds. It is receiving $7.4 million this year for land acquisition,
the amount the wildlife service requested.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Rieff, senior director in Austin for the National Wildlife
Federation, a conservation group, criticized Hutchison for not
pressing to secure the Balcones refuge's fair share. Hutchison once
secured a moratorium on the addition of species to the endangered
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vocal critics of the Endangered Species Act are always
saying that if the federal government wants to protect endangered
species it ought to buy the land,'' said Rieff, a former deputy
chief of staff for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. ``Here you
have a situation where a federal agency wants to buy it and someone
is intervening to say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has appropriated $21.2 million for the refuge, but
outlays have varied widely from year to year. For example, $5
million was appropriated in 1995, zero in 1997. The wildlife
service could spend $10 million a year on land acquisition for the
refuge if it had the money, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Holle, manager of the refuge, said the agency buys only
from willing sellers and does not condemn property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more willing sellers than we have money to buy land,''
Holle said. ``We have people on a waiting list. Some people are
going to have to make a decision: Do I wait for the refuge to get
money or do I sell it to someone else who wants to subdivide and
develop? Some people don't want their ranches developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Starnes and his partners were initially inclined not to sell.
But when they learned that their tract would be an important link
between other refuge parcels, they changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two hundred years from now, it'd be nice to have a big chunk
of public land like that that people could use and relate to,''
Starnes said.

SINGH STARTS '99 WHERE HE LEFT OFF IN '98 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAPALUA, Hawaii _ Coming off the most successful year of his
career, Vijay Singh does not sound complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you've got to forget about what happened last year,''
said Singh, who won his first major at the 1998 PGA Championship,
and finished second on the PGA Tour's money list. ``Last year is
gone. You've got to focus on the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``My focus on every tournament is a little bit more this year.
Last year, a few tournaments at the beginning of the year, I just
tried to get through the first two rounds, see how you finish. This
year I'm more focused on playing solid all four days.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. Singh started Saturday in contention to win the
tour's season-opening Mercedes Championships. Standing at 11 under
par for the tournament (135, 70-65), Singh was in a three-way tie
for second with Fred Funk and Billy Mayfair, five strokes behind
David Duval (130), who tied the Kapalua Plantation course record
Friday with a 10-under 63.
</P>
<P>
   Catching Duval will be difficult, but Singh is the kind of
player who can do it. The 7,263-yard Plantation Course favors long
hitters, and with the wind expect to pick up Saturday, Singh's
power should give him an advantage over many players in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Singh's confidence is also an advantage. He was recognized as a
very good player before he won a major, but winning the PGA
Championship has changed the way people view Singh, and it has
slightly changed the way Singh views himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I won a major, I thought if I didn't win, it wouldn't
make any difference,'' said Singh, a native of Fiji who will turn
36 next month. ``But it does make a lot of difference to your
confidence. If you win a major, it boosts your confidence so much
higher than before. That's what it has done to me. You can go out
and win any golf tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh, one of the game's hardest workers, looked sharp during
the first two rounds of the tournament, and his consistency has
long been a trademark. From August 1995 through March 1998, Singh
made 53 consecutive cuts, and he has learned the importance of
being ready to play each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've prepared for this year very well, and I've got a lot of
confidence coming in from finishing second on the money list last
year,'' Singh said. ``I'm looking forward to this year, and my goal
is to play solid in every tournament. If I can go out there and hit
solid shots, the result is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh entered 26 PGA Tour events last season, and with three new
World Golf Championship tournaments on this year's schedule, he
expects to be busy again. Singh will qualify for all three World
Golf Championship events, as a member of last year's international
Presidents Cup team, ranked No. 9 in the world ranking. The world
events will each carry a $5 million purse, and Singh is looking
forward to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rewards are always good if you play well,'' Singh said.
``I'm going to play a lot of tournaments, probably 10 out of the
first 12 events. I feel like playing, I want to play, I feel fit to
play. I'm going to have a pretty full season until August. After
August, I'm going to take it easy. I've always done that, and
that's pretty much what I'm going to do this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Since adopting a cross-handed putting style last year, Singh has
been a consistent contender. He has always been known for his
ball-striking ability, but Singh struggled with his short game and
putting for most of his career. His improved putting has turned
potential pars into birdies, and potential bogeys into pars. And
knowing he has the ability to make putts has only increased Singh's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't putt, you can't play,'' Singh said. ``It's as
simple as that. You can't win golf tournaments having 32, 33 putts.
You've got to have one or two rounds in the 20s. I've worked a lot
on my putting, and I'm beginning to get a lot more confident.''
</P>
<P>
   So if Duval slipped this weekend, Singh would be more than happy
to take the $468,000 first-place check, and the new car that will
be awarded to the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Singh enjoyed a special year in 1998. This year, he would like
to do even better. ``I think whoever putts well is going to have a
good chance,'' Singh said. ``I'm looking forward to this year. I've
got a lot of confidence.''

   LATAM-BANANAS _ MIAMI _ A taste of the tropics, nearly everyone
loves potassium-rich bananas. But this delicate fruit has split the
United States and Europe in a nasty trans-Atlantic tug-of-war that
could soon spell trouble for American consumers. This week, the
Clinton administration is expected to announce that it will go
ahead with plans to slap 100 percent tariffs on $590 million worth
of European goods as soon as Feb. 1. The move is designed to force
the European Union -- which gives preferences to banana growers in
former colonies, particularly those in the Caribbean -- to open its
markets to bananas produced in Latin America by U.S. companies. For
U.S. consumers, the retaliatory measure could double prices on
everything from cheese to linens to candles to cashmere sweaters.
But even more is at stake than higher prices. Experts fear that one
retaliation could spark another, igniting a real trade war between
the United States and the European Union that could threaten
two-way trade estimated at
</P>
<P>
   more than $400 billion a year. (Emling, Cox News Service).

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Young women scanning The Yale Daily News over
the last year have found their eyes straying to advertisements
offering up payments of $7,500 _ not quite for them but for their
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desperately Seeking Smart, Sensitive, Sunny Samaritan,'' went
one such ad. ``We are alumni looking for a donor match: A lovely
light-eyed lady with a quick, sharp laugh. Wit and warmth a must.''
</P>
<P>
   Egg donation is not news, of course. Through the process,
thousands of couples have healed the void of childlessness and
profoundly enriched their lives. But what takes the ads that have
appeared at Yale, Princeton, Harvard and other Ivy League schools
into an unsettling dimension is that the couples placing them are
insisting on a striking specificity _ going beyond requests for
blue eyes to demand Ivy League pedigree or 1,300 SAT scores.
</P>
<P>
   These couples seem to assume that if a young woman goes to Yale,
chances are her egg will end up at Yale, or the equivalent. That
not only ignores the alma mater of the sperm, but such things as
upbringing and the general capriciousness of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything so smart about me,'' says
Isaiah Wilner, a Yale male who is the editor in chief of the campus
newspaper. ``What an Ivy League student is is someone who works
hard, whose parents pushed them to do their school work. That's not
genes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some chuckle when they read how frantic parents drag 4-year-olds
barely out of diapers to IQ tests for private schools, hoping they
will launch their toddlers on trajectories toward Harvard. Is it
any different to read of people plotting a Harvard future with a
microscopic cell?
</P>

   There's a related problem, notes Daniel Callahan of the Hastings
Center, a bioethics research institute in Garrison, N.Y. ``The risk

actual child,'' he said. ``You want children to have certain
traits, but a good parent accepts the child for who he or she

   In a miraculous fertility business, many people assume they can
control everything. That's why some students boning up for another
semester beneath the Gothic grandeur of Sterling Library say the
ads make them squeamish. Egg donation is a remarkable innovation,
they say, but they are uneasy with the idea of ordering up a child
like a car, where pricey options like high SAT scores can be
specified as if they were anti-lock brakes.

<P>
   ``I have some reservations about what seems to be modern-day
eugenics,'' said Elizabeth Manwell, a graduate student in classics.
``One can understand the desire of a couple to have a child that
resembles them. But it seems kind of fantastic to try to obtain
some kind of perfect child.''
</P>
<P>
   She and others squirm at advertisers who pointedly mention being
Yale alumni, as if a woman could be persuaded to undergo painful
egg harvesting just for old Eli.

   ``As someone who did not attend an Ivy League school as an
undergraduate,'' said Ms. Manwell, who graduated from the
University of Chicago, ``I'd wonder what's wrong with my egg.''

   The ads here are placed through Options National Fertility
Registry of Los Angeles, whose Web site allows a password-armed
couple to scroll through photographs and resumes of willing donors.
Yet some prospective recipients are not satisfied with the pool,
said Teri Royal, the director of Options, and want donors from the
same Ivy League schools they've attended.

<P>
   They advertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to offer their child something that reflects who
they are as a person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable, but there is also something of a whiff of
too much calculation, and a reluctance to accept that some things
in life may not be entirely fixable.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Royal estimates that 18 to 20 Ivy League women have donated
eggs. Perhaps that number suggests that Ivy Leaguers are too well
off to be seduced by $7,500. But possibly it's because Ivy Leaguers
like Maria Fruglio, a graduate student, realize that demanding such
precision from the crap-shoot process of reproduction may not be
that smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a child doesn't end up the way the parents envision,'' she
wondered, ``how will they treat that child?''

COMMENTARY: YALE GENE POOL SEEN AS ROUTE TO BETTER BABY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Young women scanning The Yale Daily News over
the last year have found their eyes straying to advertisements
offering up payments of $7,500 _ not quite for them but for their
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desperately Seeking Smart, Sensitive, Sunny Samaritan,'' went
one such ad. ``We are alumni looking for a donor match: A lovely
light-eyed lady with a quick, sharp laugh. Wit and warmth a must.''
</P>
<P>
   Egg donation is not news, of course. Through the process,
thousands of couples have healed the void of childlessness and
profoundly enriched their lives. But what takes the ads that have
appeared at Yale, Princeton, Harvard and other Ivy League schools
into an unsettling dimension is that the couples placing them are
insisting on a striking specificity _ going beyond requests for
blue eyes to demand Ivy League pedigree or 1,300 SAT scores.
</P>
<P>
   These couples seem to assume that if a young woman goes to Yale,
chances are her egg will end up at Yale, or the equivalent. That
not only ignores the alma mater of the sperm, but such things as
upbringing and the general capriciousness of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything so smart about me,'' says
Isaiah Wilner, a Yale male who is the editor in chief of the campus
newspaper. ``What an Ivy League student is is someone who works
hard, whose parents pushed them to do their school work. That's not
genes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some chuckle when they read how frantic parents drag 4-year-olds
barely out of diapers to IQ tests for private schools, hoping they
will launch their toddlers on trajectories toward Harvard. Is it
any different to read of people plotting a Harvard future with a
microscopic cell?
</P>
<P>
   There's a related problem, notes Daniel Callahan of the Hastings
Center, a bioethics research institute in Garrison, N.Y. ``The risk
with these boutique babies is that parents will be unhappy with the
actual child,'' he said. ``You want children to have certain

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Dry air will spread over the Atlantic seaboard in the wake of a
cold front. Ample sunshine will prevail in most areas east of the
Appalachians. Afternoon temperatures will be several degrees below
the seasonal average.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, a cold front marking the leading edge of a surge
of Arctic air will move across the Great Lakes states. Snow showers
and squalls will be common as the frigid air gathers moisture in
passing across the warmer water. Intense snow squalls are expected
to reduce visibility to near zero in some areas east of Lakes Erie
and Ontario later Sunday and Sunday night as a jet stream
disturbance enhances the moist updrafts in the narrow roiling cloud
bands. Clouds and lighter snow showers will accompany the cold
front from the Ohio Valley to the west slopes of the central and
northern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will prevail over most of the Southeast and southern
Plains. A band of thundershowers will move south over central and
southern Florida as drier air arrives behind a cold front.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, patchy light snow will occur near a front in the
northern Rockies and northern Plains. A moist air flow from the
Pacific will bring rain to the Washington coast and some showers in
the interior. Snow will fall in the northern Cascades and
Bitterroots of Montana and Idaho. Farther east, strong winds will
buffet some areas along the east slopes of the central Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will keep most of the Southwest mild and dry.
Offshore winds will bring unseasonable warmth to the southern
California coast. Dense fog will plague the Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The End of Chill
</P>
<P>
   While residents from the northern Plains to the Northeast will
be shivering in another Arctic onslaught early this week, the bout
with wintry weather that began around Christmas will soon end. The
Arctic chill that reaches the United States forms over the Canadian
tundra when clear skies and calm winds allow the ground to rapidly
lose energy. These conditions are found in zones of high pressure.
Now, pressures are falling across western Canada which will limit
the production of cold air. By late this week, the current supply
of Arctic air over the United States will be depleted.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The storefront was plain, the street unprepossessing,
and the skies sent down torrents of rain. But inside last Sunday,
more than 100 members of the New Jerusalem Church were rejoicing _
singing and dancing, swaying and shouting _ as their minister
thanked God, ``who makes us sit together in heavenly places.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bishop Altamont Blackwood said, ``there is no more heavenly
place than the church.'' And the congregation's new church,
complete with a bell tower and steeple, is rising on Springfield
Boulevard in Queens, just a few blocks from the commercial strip
that has been New Jerusalem's home for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Though the congregation gives God most of the credit for the new
building, He does have a worldly partner _ the Chase Manhattan
Bank, which has lent the congregation more than $1 million for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is doing this not merely out of the goodness of its
corporate heart. Under the Federal Community Reinvestment Act of
1977, banks are required to lend money to help struggling
neighborhoods in which they do business. And at a time when
governments seem to have neither the will nor the power to help
with community redevelopment projects, Chase and other banks are
turning to God _ or at least, to some of his servants on earth _ to
do such work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that these institutions are critical to the
communities we care about,'' said Carol Parry, the bank's executive
vice president for community development. ``Our ultimate objective
is to make those communities better places to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind the Chase program is fairly simple: If
churches are bigger and have more seats, they can attract more
parishioners, who will finance and work on more community projects.
It is mostly black churches that have received loans, though the
program is open to all types of congregations and faiths. The bank
also provides grants and technical assistance to religious
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Banks have a long history of lending money for church-sponsored
programs, like low-income housing. But financing church buildings
as a way to help communities is something new. (Chase made its
first such loan, for just $150,000, in 1994.) Other large banks,
like First Union in Charlotte, N.C., are also trying to increase
their involvement with churches, and the approach was featured at a
conference on community redevelopment in October organized by the
American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Churches across the United States have occasionally borrowed
from banks before, though often only with the help of wealthy
members willing to cosign the loans or to put up a lot of cash as
security.
</P>
<P>
   Black churches have had particular trouble getting loans, said
Albert Tew, a former commercial banker who as a consultant to
churches has helped arrange some loans, including New Jerusalem's.
``There aren't too many lenders who are aware of how
African-American churches actually operate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, however, banks are becoming aware of the critical
role churches play in poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is the foundation of everything we do, in housing,
health care, and for senior citizens,'' said Edwin Reed, chief
financial officer of the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church
in Queens. ``Seats mean revenue to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen's history serves as a sort of parable for those who
support lending to religious institutions. Membership in the
church, which was founded in 1834, has soared since the Rev. Floyd
Flake became pastor in 1976, when the church had 1,400 members and
a building that could seat 200.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the church has a congregation of about 10,000 and offers
three Sunday services at a new building that seats 2,500. The
congregation raised $10 million of the $25 million cost; the rest
was financed by a group of banks put together by Chase last year.
</P>
<P>
   The church has also become a major employer in Queens, running a
dizzying array of social programs. Even for such a powerhouse of a
church, getting a loan was not easy, for reasons Reed said he
understood. Not only can it be hard to figure out where a church
will get the money to repay a loan, he noted, but there is also the
question of collateral. No bank would want to repossess a church.
</P>
<P>
   If lending $15 million to Allen took an act of faith, lending $1
million to New Jerusalem took a real leap. After all, the church
has just 250 members, almost all immigrants from the West Indies,
and they are by no means rich.
</P>
<P>
   But what their leader does have is a financial track record. Now
52, Blackwood has been preaching since he was a teen-ager in
Queens, and he came to the United States in 1970. Within seven
years, he had scraped together enough money to make a down payment
on a little building where he started his church, whose full name
is the New Jerusalem Church of God in Christ Jesus (Apostolic) Inc.
The $57,000 building was paid for in three years.
</P>
<P>
   When it was started, his congregation had only five members _
all related to him and living in the small apartment over the
church, Blackwood recalled. He remodeled the building himself,
moving the bathrooms, finishing the basement, painting the tiny
office.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the sanctuary has wood-paneled walls, a dropped ceiling
and wall-to-wall carpeting; the wooden pews are supplemented with
folding chairs when the crowd gets too big, as it often does.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Blackwood found a vacant lot for sale; he raised and
borrowed enough money for the down payment and got a five-year
mortgage from the owner. Within three years, he and the
congregation had paid off the $127,500 cost of the land.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation has also raised hundreds of thousands of
dollars for the new church, one of the reasons Chase was
comfortable making such a large loan to such a small group, said
Earlene Hampton, vice president of Chase Community Development
Corp., the unit of the bank that made the loan last spring.
</P>
<P>
   How has the congregation come up with so much cash? And how will
it cover the roughly $150,000 annual mortgage payment?
</P>
<P>
   The church does some fund raising. It sells oranges from Florida
and sponsors bus trips to family-oriented spots like the theme park
Sesame Place in Langhorne, Pa., said Maria Angus, the church's
secretary. Elfreda Moore, a 78-year-old matriarch of the church,
sells hats outside the doors on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the money comes out of church members' pockets. Many
of them tithe, giving a tenth of their incomes to the church, and
they also contribute to special fund-raising campaigns, Blackwood
said. ``Some folks that give it, give their last mite,'' he said.
``but they find such favor and love in what we are doing that they
give what they have to give.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Certainly they seem to be giving with joy. At last week's noon
service, the plate was not passed; rather, members filed to the
front of the church to contribute money and checks. Once the
offering was completed, Clara Pettigrew led the choir dancing down
the aisle and then back up to the front, as everyone sang that they
would ``Walk and Talk in the New Jerusalem Way.''
</P>
<P>
   It does not hurt the fund-raising effort that neither Blackwood
nor the assistant ministers receive a salary from the church.
Blackwood owns a small hardware store, and his wife works at
Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. Although he supervises almost a
dozen Apostolic churches in and around New York, he continues to
live simply and to spend the church's money very carefully, said
Tew, the consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The people who give the most will get the best seats in the new
church _ and those seats will be grand. Pews for 650 people will
fill the floor and balcony under a soaring wooden ceiling. Glass
blocks in the stone walls will form stylized crosses in the front
and back of the huge room. There will be enough space on the dais
up front for all the ministers and elders, the senior and junior
choirs, and even a baptismal pool.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement, there will be room to serve hot lunches to 270
needy people, and to expand the church's free food distribution
program. These programs are now run out of the old church's cramped
basement, which does not have a kitchen or enough exits to
accommodate much of a crowd. That old building will be turned into
a church-sponsored day-care center.
</P>
<P>
   These plans were crucial in Chase's decision to give the church
a loan, Ms. Parry said. And so was confidence that the church's
congregation would grow to fill the new church.
</P>
<P>
   The median household income in the mostly black neighborhood is
about $58,700, according to projections by the Queens College
sociology department. The mostly single-family homes in the
neighborhood are small but neat; many of the commercial areas,
however, are far less prosperous-looking.
</P>
<P>
   The new church is replacing decrepit buildings on land that was
being used as an illegal dump, church members say; it sits between
two open lots, their fences festooned with signs advertising
everything from used cars to goat meat.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwood hopes to acquire these lots someday, to add more
parking, perhaps even to build a school. But for now, he is just
trying to restrain his impatience to see the church completed, and
to plan a ceremony for the grand opening, which he hopes will be in
March.
</P>
<P>
   And, along with his congregation, he is counting his blessings.
The list last Sunday was long _ the service lasted almost three
hours _ and included all kinds of things, spiritual and physical,
including the new church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't dream he would lend us more than $1 million to build
a church, just a small group of people as we are,'' Blackwood said,
referring to God, as exclamations of ``Jesus!'' and ``Hallelujah!''
rose from the congregation. ``He made a way where there was no
way.''

<P>
   OXFORD, England _ Colin Blakemore, Wayneflete Professor of
Physiology at Oxford and director of the university's Center for
Cognitive Neuroscience, spends his days like any academic, in an
office with brimming in-trays and bookshelves stacked high with
research volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Nights he's at home in an undisclosed suburb in a house
surrounded by high fences, security cameras, alarms and tripwire
lights and configured inside with shielded doors, hidden intercoms
and a front hallway blocked from view to deny direct aim to any
shooter outside. His mail has been examined closely ever since
police intercepted a gift for his teen-age daughter in Christmas
wrapping five years ago that turned out to be a cardboard calendar
tube filled with high explosives and needles.
</P>
<P>
   His work has won him awards for advances in treating vision
problems in infants and young children. But it has also attracted
the attention of a violence-prone movement that says it wants to
kill him because his research depends on animal testing.
</P>
<P>
   His enemies are members of groups with flag-of-convenience names
like the Animal Liberation Front, the Justice Department, the
Animals Betrayed Coalition, Band of Mercy and the Animal Rights
Militia.
</P>
<P>
   They are clandestine organizations that have taken a passion
long associated with England _ the care and welfare of animals _
and transformed it into a ski-masked movement with absolutist
notions and the tactics of terror in defense of ``our animal
brothers and sisters.'' A number of its members are serving lengthy
jail terms for bombing campaigns against corner drugstores,
laboratories, woolen mill shops, kennels, slaughterhouses,
refrigerator trucks, fishmongers, butchers and animal breeding
farms.
</P>
<P>
   The first animal welfare group in the world was founded in
England in 1824, and the country has 3,000 such organizations
today. Far from representing just the cuddly house pets that get
protection in many societies, England is famous to the point of
being lampooned for having groups dedicated to the preservation of
bats, frogs, insects and rodents.
</P>
<P>
   The fringe groups have left the civilities of the traditional
cause behind. They have safe houses, secret bank accounts, codes,
Internet mailing lists and bomb-making instruction manuals.
Scotland Yard's special antiterror branch has a separate databank
called the Animal Rights National Index.
</P>
<P>
   Though some 15,000 British scientists use animals like mice,
rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, cats and monkeys to research diseases
and produce medicines, Blakemore, a 54-year-old Cambridge graduate
with a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley, has
been prominent in defending the practice as essential to the
progress of medical science.
</P>
<P>
   On the Animal Liberation Front Web site, Blakemore and his
fellow medical researchers are likened to Nazis. ``If we are
trespassing,'' it says, ``than so were the soldiers who broke down
the gates of Hitler's death camps.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of animal experiments in Britain has declined in the
last 25 years from 7 million a year to 2.6 million, and the code of
conduct governing them, laid down in a 1987 law, is the toughest in
the world. The levels of care demanded often exceed legal standards
for the housing and feeding of human beings in vulnerable
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But the activists want all testing to cease and threaten to back
their argument by assassinating 10 scientists who believe in animal
experimentation. Blakemore and two other researchers who have
joined him in denouncing the movement head the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone hopes for the time when animals won't be needed at
all,'' Blakemore said in an interview. ``That would be marvelous.
I'd be the first to crack the champagne. But to pretend that we are
there now is not only a misrepresentation, it is actually
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, security at his home was tightened and new border
gates were installed in the narrow streets threading through
Oxford's Gothic campus buildings because of stepped-up threats from
the militant anti-vivisectionists. Police say the protection he
receives is modeled on that afforded Britons on Irish Republican
Army hit lists in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The British government has not denounced the activists as firmly
as Blakemore would like. But last month it said it was going to
replace laws created in the 1970s to address the IRA threat with a
single act that would expand the definition of terrorism to include
religious and ideological as well as political motives. Jack Straw,
the Home secretary, specified that would include ``animal rights
activists who perpetrate serious acts of terrorist violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The militants' cause galvanized last month around Barry Horne, a
46-year-old former garbageman who was jailed for 18 years for arson
attacks on shopping centers. Sixty days into a hunger strike, Horne
said he would starve himself to death unless a Royal Commission was
created to discuss the end of animal experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Horne said he had signed an order barring anyone from
force-feeding him if he lost consciousness. As he lived only on
liquids, his weight had gone from 196 pounds to 118 pounds, and he
was said to have lost the sight in one eye and the hearing in one
ear.
</P>
<P>
   The government had banned all animal testing in connection with
cosmetics, alcohol and tobacco products last fall, but it said it
would not be persuaded by the threats to do more. Horne's backers
said that when he died, the 10 scientists would be killed. The list
was posted on the Internet, and Horne said from his hospital bed:
``People must do what they feel is right in response to my death.
Look at the evil of the Nazis and the level of violence needed _
quite rightly _ to stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore urged Horne to spare himself and offered to meet with
his supporters. Spokesmen representing mainstream animal rights
groups denounced the forced starvation tactic and said it would
harm the image of those battling for the cause by legitimate means.
Eventually, Horne abandoned his hunger strike on Dec. 14 after 68
days. Doctors said none of the damage he had done himself was
irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore said he was determined to continue with efforts to
combat what he considers propaganda and disinformation about animal
testing. He argued that it was impossible to come up with any form
of conventional medical treatment that had not at some point
depended on research on animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just ask yourself about any technique that a doctor might do
to you and if it's conceivable that it was done for the first time
on a human being,'' he said. ``Take angioplasty. I say: `Hey, I've
got a great idea for solving this problem. We'll stick a little
tube up through an artery somewhere, and we'll thread it all the
way through this guy. Then we'll blow up a balloon in his coronary
vessel and crush the deposits of plaque.' Can you imagine someone
saying, `Yes, I'll be the first'? It's out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   To the argument that computer technology has made animal
experimentation unnecessary, Blakemore said, ``The way to focus on
that question is to note that the law in this country requires you
to demonstrate that there is no alternative to the use of animals
before you can get a project license.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore's research involves surgically altering the vision and
in some cases closing the eye lids of cats bred for the purpose,
tracking their reactions and then examining their brains once they
have been put to sleep with an overdose of anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a printout of the Internet death list, Blakemore said
defending himself was taking up 20 percent of his work time.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years he has succeeded in setting up a forum called
the Boyd Group in Edinburgh that brings together scientists and
animal rights activists who shun violent tactics. Protesters have
been able to press their case for cutting back on animal
experimentation as much as possible without jeopardizing medical
inquiry, and researchers have been able to describe steps they take
to reduce the suffering of animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy for agitators to create the impression that mad
scientists are doing horrendous stuff to helpless pet kitties when
it isn't true at all,'' Blakemore said. ``They never mention the
anesthetics we use or the benefits we obtain.''

   The articles of impeachment voted by the House made 11 specific
charges against President Clinton, against which his lawyers have
raised specific defenses.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE ACCUSATIONS &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``William Jefferson Clinton willfully provided perjurious, false
and misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning one or more
of the following:''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Giving a false account of the nature and details of his
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky;
</P>
<P>
   2. Refusing to admit that he gave prior false testimony in the
Paula Corbin Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit;
</P>
<P>
   3. Allowing his attorney, Robert Bennett, to make false
statements during the president's deposition in the Jones case;
</P>
<P>
   4. Lying to aides about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in an
effort to influence their grand jury testimony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE DEFENSE &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's legal defense against these allegations has
been:
</P>
<P>
   1. The president admitted he had an ``inappropriate, intimate''
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky before the grand jury;
</P>
<P>
   2. The president contends that under the very narrow definition
of sexual relations allowed by the judge in the Jones case, he did
not lie.
</P>
<P>
   3. No perjury was involved in the statements made by Bennett at
the Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   4. There is no evidence to contradict the president's testimony
regarding comments he made to his aides; about his conversations
with Ms. Lewinsky about gifts or his description of conversations
with Betty Currie. Even Kenneth Starr did not allege perjury in
these statements.
</P>
<P>
   THE ACCUSATIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   William Jefferson Clinton ``has prevented, obstructed, and
impeded the administration of justice, and has to that end engaged
personally, and through his subordinates and agents, in a course of
conduct or scheme designed to delay, impede, cover up and conceal
the existence of evidence and testimony related to a federal civil
rights action brought against him.'' The article cites these
particulars:
</P>
<P>
   1. Encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the
Jones case;
</P>
<P>
   2. Encouraging her to give false testimony if she was called to
appear in the Jones case;
</P>
<P>
   3. Encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to conceal gifts he had given her;
</P>
<P>
   4. Helping Ms. Lewinsky secure employment to insure her silence;
</P>
<P>
   5. Allowing Bennett to make false and misleading statements
during the Jones deposition;
</P>
<P>
   6. Attempting to influence the testimony of Betty Currie;
</P>
<P>
   7. Attempting to influence the testimony of aides by giving a
false account of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's legal defense against these allegations has
been:
</P>
<P>
   1. &AMP; 2. Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony that ``No one ever
asked me to lie'' flatly contradicts charges that Clinton
encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit or give false
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   3. Ms. Lewinsky gave 10 accounts in her testimony of
conversations with Clinton about gifts and did not testify that he
suggested she hide gifts or give them to Ms. Currie.
</P>
<P>
   4. Ms. Lewinsky testified that ``no one ever offered me a job
for my silence.'' Efforts to assist Ms. Lewinsky in finding a job
began months before she appeared on the witness list in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   5. The president was not paying close attention to Bennett's
statements during the Jones deposition;
</P>
<P>
   7. In discussions with his aides, the president was concealing
an improper relationship, not trying to influence future testimony.

CON ED WORKERS PROTEST UNION'S TAKEOVER OF LOCAL AND LEADER'S
OUSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thousands of Con Ed workers are angry at their
Washington-based parent union for taking direct control of their
10,000-member local in July and ousting their popular leader, who
plans to ask a federal judge to reinstate him.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 members of Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers
Union of America have signed a petition protesting the decision to
remove their leader, Joseph Flaherty, and put the union into
trusteeship. Flaherty's supporters, who say he was a forceful
leader who had obtained improved pensions and unusual job security
guarantees for them, asserted that the president of the national
union had engineered a crude power play to push aside an outspoken
critic and potential challenger for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the folks from the national union as terrorists who
took over the local for no reason whatsoever,'' said Harry Farrell,
a troubleshooter on high-voltage problems for Con Ed. ``They know
Joe Flaherty was a powerful union leader. His integrity was
impeccable. In my 34 years in the union, we never had a leader like
Joe Flaherty.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donald Wightman, president of the parent union, the
45,000-member Utility Workers Union, said the union took over its
largest local and removed Flaherty to rescue it from insolvency and
from a leader who was stifling dissent and democracy. Wightman also
said the local had wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars on
excessive legal fees and a bloated payroll. He said allegations
that Flaherty was being punished for his outspoken opposition were
absolutely false.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty had repeatedly accused Wightman of violating federal
law by accepting utility industry money to set up forums against
deregulation of the electric industry. Both the union and the
utilities fear deregulation will mean competition and layoffs. But
Wightman said his lawyers advised him it was legal to use the money
for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have furiously swapped charges and countercharges.
Judge Loretta Preska of U.S. District Court in Manhattan has been
sifting through the conflicting accounts but so far has upheld the
trusteeship. This month, Flaherty plans to file new court papers
asking the judge to reinstate him as the local's chief executive _
his formal title was business manager _ or to order a new election
for the local's officers. Since his ouster, Flaherty, who had
headed the local since 1991, has returned to his work in a manhole,
splicing cables.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who wins the court battle, both sides agree that
this has been an ugly, painful episode not only for a respected
union local, but also for New York City's labor movement, which has
been scarred by a corruption scandal at District Council 37, the
giant municipal union.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has also hurt Consolidated Edison. The utility
negotiated a two-year contract extension with James Keller, the
trustee running the local, but Flaherty turned the ratification
vote into a referendum on the trusteeship, and the extension was
overwhelmingly defeated, by a more than 2 to 1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Wightman said he had acted courageously in removing Flaherty.
``If you put a local into trusteeship, you're hated,'' he said.
``It's not the most popular thing to do. Whether the members knew
it or not, there was financial malpractice. If I didn't act, that
local was as close to being insolvent as you can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Wightman said that under Flaherty, the local's net assets fell
to $1 million from $3.5 million. And that, he said, was before
Flaherty projected a $500,000 deficit for last year. Wightman cited
examples of wasteful spending _ a $4,000 weekly retainer to the
local's general counsel, more than $2 million a year for wages and
benefits for the local's 20 full-time officers and more than
$200,000 a year for leased cars and auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Wightman said it was wasteful to have 20 full-time officers. And
he faulted Flaherty for not reducing the union's staff when
membership fell to 10,000 from 13,000, after reductions in the Con
Ed work force because of automation. He also attacked Flaherty for
paying legal fees with money from the fund meant to support members
during a strike, without first getting members' approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local was for all practical purposes bankrupt,'' Keller,
the trustee, said. ``Unfortunately, for years the members were
informed only by what he told them.''
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty acknowledged the local's finances were in bad shape,
but he said they were no worse than when he was elected as its
leader. The main reasons for the local's financial woes, he said,
were the drop in membership and the million dollars a year in dues
sent to the national union.
</P>
<P>
   He said he acted frugally, noting that he cut his salary to
$95,000 from $100,000 and had officers give up leased luxury cars
in favor of Ford Tauruses. He insisted that the local's staff was
smaller than when he took the local's helm. Flaherty said that when
he had the bylaws amended to allow him to reduce the number of
officers to save money, the national union attacked him for trying
to force out officers who disagreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trusteeship is an outrage,'' Flaherty said. ``It's purely
political. They could have trusteed me any time, but they only did
it after I criticized the national president. If I was a good boy
and kept my mouth shut, I'd still be there.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FIESTA BOWL BECOMES JACKSON'S LONG GOODBYE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 12:05 a.m. Tuesday, Eastern standard time, the Fiesta Bowl
mercifully ended. The Tostitos were soggy, the Diet Coke flat.
After 3 hours 50 minutes _ not counting a 15-minute pre-game show _
Tennessee won. The Christmas yule log burned faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had everything in this game,'' ABC's Bob Griese said
late in the Vols' 23-16 victory over Florida State. ``We've had
missed extra points, missed field goals, defensive scores.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' Keith Jackson said, ``but beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Beauty might have revved up matters (and might have saved us the
pathetic sight of a Frito-Lay executive trying to hand the
victorious Tennessee coach, Phillip Fulmer, a bag of Tostitos;
here, Coach, bet you can't eat just one!)
</P>
<P>
   But in college football, games rarely end in less time than
``Lawrence of Arabia.'' They may be exciting, but they are not
quick. If they could rush along like Lou Holtz's mouth, victory
could be declared. But college games are slowed by first-down clock
stoppages and 20-minute halftime shows; throw in a sloppy one with
21 penalties, like the Fiesta, and you're not in Hallelujah Land.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta's lugubrious pace led viewers to abandon it before
the final gun. When nothing much happens, even the national
championship can induce surfing.
</P>
<P>
   After peaking at a 19.1 rating from 10-10:30 p.m., the game
concluded with a 16.2 thud from 11:30 to midnight _ a loss of 2.6
million households in 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 17.2 final Nielsen rating routed ABC's competition _
CBS rated a 10.9 from 8-11 p.m., with ``Sleepless in Seattle'' as
its prime attraction _ and finished 27 percent above last year's
Nebraska-Tennessee Orange Bowl, which matched the two top teams
available to the former bowl alliance. Last year's Rose Bowl, which
made Michigan the co-national champion, rated a 17.6.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fiesta was not a fittingly glorious game for Jackson to
retire on. His finale merited a classic. He got a boring clunker.
But his rich voice, singular verbal skills and personal grace
provided the reasons to hang in.
</P>
<P>
   As the day darkened in Tempe, Ariz., Jackson said: ``Nighttime
in the land where the Chirakawa used to hunt.'' Few announcers
could get away with a reference to Apaches. Fewer still would know
enough to refer to them.
</P>
<P>
   After a Florida State 5-yard penalty, Jackson said: ``Oh, it's a
little thing. It's 5 yards. It's a nickel. But if you get enough
nickels, first thing you know, you've got a quarter, then a heavy
sack, and then you ain't going nowhere.'' From any other announcer,
such words might seem excessive, but they emerged from Jackson as
naturally as anything from Red Barber.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson will be missed because he defined his sport. When a
defender rocks a receiver, we'll want to hear the old hoss say, ``I
mean to tell you, he put some lumber on him.'' Or, ``That was some
licking.'' Or when the Big Uglies have put in a hard day, no one
will say, ``Griese, the boys who played all game in the trenches
won't be so nimble at the dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Griese _ perhaps an unlikely pairing because Griese
can seem stiff _ had more than bonded by this, their 12th year
together. Jackson's goading for Griese to be more emotional last
season in calling Michigan games featuring his son, Brian, brought
a sense of on-air friendship to their partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at the moon, wondering why you didn't call it a
possum-hunting moon,'' Griese said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's not possum-hunting time,'' Jackson said. ``Snow's
too deep.''
</P>
<P>
   After a fumbled handoff by Tennessee with 1:29 left in the game,
Griese asked, ``At a critical time in the game, how can you miss
the exchange?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder, when that happens, why does someone want to
coach?'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Jackson turned misty when Griese informed him that
a $100,000 scholarship in his name had been endowed at his alma
mater, Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cup will always be half full because of people like you,''
Jackson said. Despite his protests, Jackson survived the myriad
tributes paid to him during his last season. Although flattered
that Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, wanted to visit
him off camera in the booth Monday night, Jackson fretted that
there might not be enough time between halves, when he wanted to
prepare for the third period. Jackson relented, and they chatted
briefly.
</P>
<P>
   At night's end, the 70-year-old Jackson thanked the ABC crew,
and concluded his career by saying: ``And so, Phillip Fulmer has
been validated. He's now one of the legends that have spent time at
the foot of the Smokies. And so it is done. I say goodbye to all of
you. God bless and keep you. Good night.''  &QL;

REAL ESTATE: ASHEVILLE, N.C., PUBLIC MARKET HOPING TO BLOOM
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By LYN RIDDLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ The Grove Arcade began life in 1929 as a
public market, but housed federal offices for nearly half a
century. By year's end, the mammoth building in the heart of this
city's downtown will recapture its birthright.
</P>
<P>
   In January, workers moved into the 269,000-square-foot building,
one of the nation's first indoor malls, to begin the $10 million
transformation. Asheville officials hope a public market will do
for their city what similar enterprises have done for others.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, public markets, with locally owned small
businesses that focus on selling local products, have breathed life
back into downtowns or renewed long-neglected sections across the
nation. Dozens of cities are building or planning new markets,
including the Portland Public Market in Portland, Maine, which
opened in November. In other cities like Atlanta and Buffalo,
millions of dollars have been invested in long-standing markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``As institutions, they're so ancient, one of the things that we
all share cross-culturally,'' said David K. O'Neil, the former
manager of the Reading Market in Philadelphia, who is now a market
consultant. ``It's nice to have a center of your community where
everything connects.''
</P>
<P>
   Markets, he said, touch people at an emotional level.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are attracted to people,'' he said. ``They love to buy
from people who know the product.'' Markets, he added, create an
environment of conviviality.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil estimates 100 markets exist today. Best known perhaps is
Pike Place Market in Seattle, founded in 1907, which noticeably
declined in the 1970's.
</P>
<P>
   After $55 million was invested in the market, it turned around.
Today, the market spills across 22 acres on Puget Sound and
attracts 11 million people each year. It also generated a total
investment of $650 million from private developers of stores,
hotels and 1,800 apartment units.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Zaretsky, the executive director of the Asheville effort,
was a director at Pike Place for 15 years before moving here three
years ago. Zaretsky heads the Grove Arcade Public Market
Foundation, a nonprofit organization that has leased the building
from the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Grove Arcade was built by E.W. Grove, who made a fortune
selling tonics that were said to cure all manner of ills. His
slogan was ``makes children and adults as fat as pigs.'' Grove also
built the Grove Park Inn, a luxury resort still operating about
five miles away from the arcade.
</P>
<P>
   Grove had planned for a high-rise tower on top of the
marketplace, but he died before the building was finished. The work
stopped at just two stories. In 1942, the federal government,
looking for space outside Washington to house agencies not
essential to the war effort, bought the Grove Arcade. Until three
years ago when a new federal building was built a block away, all
the nation's weather data were stored at the National Climatic Data
Center in the Grove Arcade.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the largest computer in the region _ an 8-foot-tall
UNIVAC used to store weather data that filled an 80- by 150-foot
room _ was housed in the building. It was such a novelty that a
small platform was built outside the office so residents could
watch it work. The platform still exists in the arcade walkway.
</P>
<P>
   When the weather center and other smaller federal agencies moved
into the new federal building, the government deeded the property
to the city. The foundation that has leased the building from the
city is responsible for the renovation of the basement and first
floor of the building, while a private developer will refurbish the
upper two floors and a mezzanine for offices and residences.
</P>
<P>
   On the first floor, foundation planners hope to lease space to
an eclectic mix of businesses, everything from a Thai restaurant to
a bicycle shop, a fish market to a craft store. To keep the flavor
of a public market, all the stores will be locally owned and will
cater to a local clientele. Generally, public markets provide
opportunity to small businesses, giving them an edge on larger,
nationally known chains.
</P>
<P>
   And some nationally known businesses have started out at public
markets. Starbucks Coffee began as a small coffeehouse in Pike
Place.
</P>
<P>
   Public markets are not to be confused with festival markets,
which H. Christopher Slusher, Zaretsky's assistant, describes as
shopping districts filled with upscale national chains catering to
tourists. Fanueil Hall in Boston and Inner Harbor in Baltimore
would be considered festival markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Public markets are more down-home, as in a fish store in Pike
Place where a worker is apt to throw a salmon across the shop to
have it wrapped for a customer. ``The stores showcase the best
products of a region,'' said Slusher, an architect who worked for
the National Trust for Historic Preservation before coming here in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Appalachian crafts and handmade furniture will be
spotlighted, as will smoked salmon and ramp, a garlicky onion that
grows wild in the southern Appalachians and is considered a
delicacy. Slusher hopes stores will feature baskets, weaving and
quilting as well as the basic needs: groceries, banks, photo
developing, garden supply, ice cream shop, a mailing service.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So far, 450 people have expressed a desire to open a shop in the
public market area, which ultimately will have 60 spaces plus about
15 stalls for fresh food vendors. Financing comes from a $1 million
grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration, $1 million
in contributions and $2.5 million in financing. A parking lot _ for
cars and bicycles _ will be constructed in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has leased the top three floors of the building
to Rick Skelton, an Atlanta developer who intends to renovate the
space for an undetermined number of offices and 52 apartments that
will be converted to condominiums in a few years. In addition, a
band shell in the tower overlooking the rooftop will be renovated
and the roof will be used for public gatherings, meetings,
receptions and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The residences and the rooftop overlook downtown Asheville and
the Blue Ridge Mountains, which ring this city of 60,000 in western
North Carolina. The marketplace will serve to foster an already
reviving downtown, said City Manager James Westbrook. He hopes the
city will be able to attract a medium-priced hotel chain to the
block between the marketplace and Asheville Civic Center to enable
the city to play host to bigger conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some larger and more famous Southern cities like Atlanta
and Charlotte, Asheville has not leveled its historic buildings in
favor of new development. City leaders say it has the nation's
second largest number of Art Deco buildings after Miami. City Hall
itself is an Art Deco tower whose renovation has just been
completed with a $1 million yearlong replacement of its distinctive
red tile roof.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away is the First Baptist Church, whose Art Deco
design sets it apart from its Baptist cousins of staid brick, high
white steeples and white columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a conscious decision to retain these buildings,''
Westbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   The city has worked, too, to develop and enhance its artistic
side. Shops that were long empty now house art galleries, jewelry
stores, crafts, even a shop that features items from expeditions.
Pack Square features a number of museums, including one that
features minerals and gemstones, for which North Carolina is
famous. Sculpture dresses up many street corners and yards outside
buildings. One notable piece _ by Albert Paley, the metal sculptor
_ stands outside the new federal building. Some locals consider it
brilliant; others say it looks like a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Slusher says planners hope the Arcade Marketplace will further
revitalize life in the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building was beautifully designed and is in remarkable
condition,'' he said. ``This city has a heart and soul as an urban
center and can reclaim itself as the center for commerce in the
region. We're well on our way to doing that.''

HOCKEY COLUMN: ERRATIC RANGERS TEST SMITH'S SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was just a coincidence, getting sick to my stomach while
covering the hurting New York Rangers this past week. In Washington
in time for Thursday's game, but unable to travel the last mile
from hotel bed to press box, I listened, instead, to the Capitals'
radio announcer screaming: ``Richter is down and out! The Capitals
score!'' He said so on every goal. Lapsing in and out of sleep,
redreaming the play-by-play between headaches, it seemed as if the
score were 15-1 instead of the 5-1 result shown in the morning
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The radio clicked on the next morning to the same station. Don
Imus was interviewing Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. ``I hate hockey,''
Imus said to McCain. ``Well,'' McCain replied, ``you ought to go to
a game.'' It was one of the best things any senator said all week.
And it was time to shuttle back to New York ahead of the snow to
contemplate the Rangers as they approach the halfway point of the
1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't a bad team. Worse than bad, they are mediocre, good
enough to raise hopes and then dash them. They can win on the road
and lose at home, beat some good teams and lose to some bad ones.
Still possessing one of the league's oldest and most expensive
rosters, the Rangers probably have enough talent, professionalism
and stubbornness to contend for a playoff berth, at least until the
last snow melts. As bad as they have looked in losing their last
two games, their near-term schedule suggests a turnaround. Their
next four games are all against current last-place teams _ Tampa,
the Islanders, Chicago and Montreal. All except Montreal are at
home. All except Montreal are preceded by a day or two of rest,
which older Rangers really need.
</P>
<P>
   The game against the Islanders on Wednesday is No. 41 of an
82-game schedule which is as forgiving as it is long. Down the
stretch, the right trade or two could put the Rangers in the
playoffs, guaranteeing at least two lucrative gates at Madison
Square Garden. It is the sort of thing top management might
consider in evaluating Neil Smith, the president and general
manager, now in his 10th season. His bosses forgave one dark
spring. Two in a row might be pushing it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will probably have to do it without Esa Tikkanen,
the funny Finn who is dragging his skate heels about reporting for
his demotion to the Hartford farm club.
</P>
<P>
   Tikkanen was supposed to get a salary bonus after 40 games on
the major league roster. He has threatened to file a grievance
because he cleared waivers while nursing a knee injury that
apparently worsened only when he was put on waivers. Teams can't
waive injured players. A Hartford spokesman said Tikkanen did not
report to Friday's practice, as he was told to do. A Ranger
spokesman said that Tikkanen was due to see a doctor Friday and was
expected to report to Hartford on Friday night, and that Tikkanen
was not suspended.
</P>
<P>
   His departure leaves the Rangers dressing only 10 players ages
30 or older among the 20 in uniform for each game. Their age could
be why they looked so weary Thursday in Washington in playing their
third game in four nights, according to those who witnessed the
debacle. Tikkanen was supposed to fit in so well with Wayne Gretzky
and the whole coaching staff. He knew them back in Edmonton in the
1980s, when all were younger. So much for cronyism and wishful
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Smith's roster moves have worked out so badly. He has
improved the team with trades for Petr Nedved, Todd Harvey, Peter
Popovic, Mike Knuble and Mathieu Schneider. John MacLean was a
decent free-agent signing and so was Brent Fedyk. Draftees like
Marc Savard, Dan Cloutier and Manny Malhotra have been impressive.
(And how long will it be before coach John Muckler gives more
playing time to Cloutier and Malhotra?) Smith and Muckler have had
less success with pickups of Stan Neckar, Rumun Ndur, Scott Fraser,
Chris Tamer and Sean Pronger.
</P>
<P>
   More tough decisions are approaching. Brian Leetch, Adam Graves
and Ulf Samuelsson could walk away as unrestricted free agents next
summer. Wayne Gretzky has an option year left on his contract. All
four are over 30. All four are among the top 10 Rangers. Those four
might earn a combined $15 to $20 million next season. All are good
citizens, but their contracts could make Smith woozy in the
stomach, ready to head for bed.

VERMONT SNOWBOARDER IS A NATURAL AT 18
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt.)   (jw) 
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was about six years ago that snowboarders in central Vermont
began hearing stories about the little dude with the big black
helmet who was taking the mountain apart.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when few snowboarders wore headgear, the helmet was
one of the things that set Adam Petraska of Andover, Vt., then 12
years old, apart from the hordes of young riders on the slopes. But
it soon became apparent that the helmet was not the only thing
different about him.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer verve with which Petraska rode the halfpipe made him
unique at an early age, almost from the moment he first received a
snowboard for Christmas at age 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would come at 1 p.m. on Thursday afternoons to Okemo with
the rest of the schoolchildren from Chester and Andover,'' said
Gordon Robbins, a member of the board of directors of the
International Snowboard Federation, referring to the Okemo Mountain
School, where he still trains and studies. ``He was always the best
rider _ he was totally natural on the board _ but he was such a
ball of fun, too, and that's what made him different.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always looking for something to jump, spin, bonk or hit
off of,'' Robbins recalled. ``He'd hurl himself in the air and come
down in a complete splat and get up with a huge grin on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the splats have been few.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1995, when an international federation event was
canceled in Canada and restaged at Okemo, Vt., with the condition
that some local riders could participate, Petraska, then 13,
finished 23rd among some of the best riders in the world.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, he won his first national competition; in 1997, he
attended his first junior worlds, and last year at 17 he won the
junior world championship with a pair of runs through the halfpipe
that had people rubbing their eyes in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Now 18, Petraska is challenging the adults as well, finishing
third in the season's first Grand Prix in December at Mount
Bachelor, Ore., and headed into this weekend's Grand Prix at Copper
Mountain, Colo., ranked No. 2 in the U.S. Amateur Snowboarder
Association behind Todd Richards in halfpipe and No. 12 in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what I try to do is push myself constantly to higher
levels, whether it's a certain trick or anything else,'' said the
5-foot-10-inch, 165-pound Petraska, who wears his blond hair
shoulder-length. ``I try to focus on that one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Petraska's regimen as a senior at Okemo combines a basic high
school curriculum with a decidedly unbasic emphasis on winter
sports training. With his close friend and fellow rider, Abe Teter,
20, acting as his personal fitness expert and nutritionist,
Petraska is on the mountain from 8 to 11:30 a.m. Weight-lifting and
more training in the halfpipe come later. He fits in academics as
time and tutors permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one thing he does differently or better than anyone
else; it's that he is a total competitor: He sees the top and he
says, `I'm gonna be there,' '' said Teter of Belmont, Vt. ``For
instance, at the junior worlds last year, he said beforehand, `I'm
going to win it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Having skied from age 2, Petraska easily transferred his summer
skateboarding skills to snowboarding. He asked for a board for
Christmas when he was 9 (``I was really disappointed when I didn't
get it,'' he said). The following Christmas, Petraska was on the
mountain the next day, teaching himself how to ride. Competition
was a natural next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the day I was making turns,'' he said. ``The
next day I went up with a bunch of friends, and I guess I caught on
real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Petraska found he enjoyed the competition as
much as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition is cool,'' he said. ``Not only are you with your
friends, you get to travel, and it pushes your snowboarding to a
higher level. I'm definitely better than I was a year ago, and as
the season goes on I hope that progression will continue.''

FIRE SAFETY: PLANNING IS KEY
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What would you do _ what specific action would you
take right now _ if you just learned there was a fire in your
building?
</P>
<P>
   Those who try to answer that question might argue that it is
difficult to do so without some additional information _ such as
the severity and location of the fire, for example, or whether
there is smoke in the hallways or exit stairs.
</P>
<P>
   But such information, fire-safety experts say, is rarely
available during a real fire and, when information is available, it
is often unreliable and at times irrelevant. This became painfully
clear late last month when four residents of a high rise on West
60th street died while doing something most would consider
reasonable _ leaving their burning building via the fire stairs.
Even seemingly reasonable actions can result in tragedy in the
chaos and confusion that accompany a fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high-rise fires people tend to panic and leave their
apartments,'' said Barbara Strauss, senior vice president of the
Owens Group, an insurance broker in Englewood Cliffs, N.J. ``In
most cases, they would be much better off if they would just stay
where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Strauss, whose company offers seminars on fire safety to
residents and boards in client buildings, said that while
residential buildings in New York City are not required to have
sprinkler systems, most high-rise structures have safety features
like self-closing, fire-rated doors designed to minimize the spread
of fire in the building. In such buildings, she said, it is
generally safer for residents to stay in their apartments and wait
for help or instructions than to attempt to exit the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, the fire department will use loudspeakers from
outside the building to tell the people inside what to do,'' Ms.
Strauss said, adding that about the only time residents should
leave their apartments during a fire is when they are instructed to
do so by the fire department or when the fire is inside the
apartment itself.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Lanza, a New York City firefighter and president of the
board of Boulevard Gardens, a 966-unit co-op in Woodside, Queens,
agreed. ``In a high rise, you're usually better off staying put,''
Lanza said. ``And if people in their apartments are getting nervous
or scared, they can call 911, tell the operator what apartment
they're in, and the chief on the scene will usually send in some
firefighters to check on them.''
</P>
<P>
   David Kuperberg, president of Cooper Square Realty, a management
company, said that his company provided residents in client
buildings with fire-safety strategies in an operations and
procedures manual that the company prepares. Since every building
is different, Kuperberg said, each should have an individualized
plan.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, in buildings that have an intercom system
tied to the concierge desk it is possible for someone at the desk
to use the system to provide emergency instructions to residents on
specific floors or apartments.
</P>
<P>
   An even better way to keep residents informed or alert them of
an emergency, Kuperberg said, would be to install a building-wide
public address system with speakers installed in the hallway on
each floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most residential buildings don't have a PA system,'' he said.
``But it would be a huge benefit to have one and probably wouldn't
cost more than a few thousand dollars to install.'' Kuperberg, who
is a lieutenant with the volunteer fire department in Scarsdale,
N.Y., also recommends the installation of ``hard-wired'' smoke
detectors whenever an apartment is being altered or renovated. Such
devices, he explained, use the electrical wiring in a building _
instead of batteries _ as their primary power source.
</P>
<P>
   Kuperberg also pointed out that the ``stay put'' strategy
commonly given to residents in concrete and steel high-rise
buildings would not necessarily apply to inhabitants of other kinds
of buildings. ``People in a five-story brownstone with a fire
escape should probably use the fire escape,'' said Kuperberg.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, it is generally advisable for those
responsible for management of a multiple dwelling to contact fire
officials in the area and ask for help in developing a specific
plan for residents to use in the event of a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Marolyn Davenport, senior vice president of the Real Estate
Board of New York, an industry organization, said that the board
plans a ``major effort to educate occupants of high-rise apartment
buildings about what to do in the event of a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davenport said that over the next few weeks, residents of
member buildings, which include co-ops, condominiums and rental
buildings, would receive pamphlets on fire safety prepared by the
board with and the New York City Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cholst, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that he advises
boards he represents to develop a plan of ``panic management'' to
cover various emergency situations. ``I think it is imperative to
provide residents with a written protocol for dealing with each and
every scenario that might occur,'' Cholst said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that it was important for boards to rigorously enforce
all house rules that relate to safety. He pointed, for example, to
rules regarding apartment alterations, noting that faulty design or
construction could result in a fire hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Matters relating to building security and maintenance should be
closely monitored as well, Cholst said. ``Members of the building
staff often succumb to the temptation to tinker with complicated
equipment and end up making a bad situation worse,'' he said. ``And
all areas with equipment and machinery should be off-limits to
residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, after seven fatalities in fires in Manhattan and
Brooklyn _ including three city firefighters _ Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen held a news
conference to offer fire safety tips to New Yorkers living in
high-rise apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the tips are the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ When there is a fire in your apartment, leave immediately,
making sure to shut the door behind you. Alert as many other
residents on the floor as possible, and leave the building using
the nearest stairwell. Under no circumstances should an elevator be
used during a fire or a suspected fire. Upon reaching the lobby or
street, immediately notify the Fire Department by calling 911.
</P>
<P>
   _ If there is a fire elsewhere in the building, remain in your
apartment. Call 911 and provide the operator with your name,
address, the location of your apartment and other pertinent
information like loss of electric power or conditions requiring
special medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the apartment door closed and block the bottom with a wet
towel or blanket. Turn off air-conditioners and close the windows
if smoke is entering the apartment. If you are unable to escape,
seek refuge in the room farthest from the point of smoke entry and
notify the 911 operator that you are trapped.

REAL ESTATE: THE MOVIES ARE THE NEW STARS OF THE MALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass, Mich., N.Y., Tenn.)  (js) 
 By DIANA SHAMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STONY BROOK, N.Y. _ The 15-screen Loews movie theater that
opened here on Route 347 on Dec. 23 is _ for the moment _ the
biggest, plushest and most elaborate on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   But others equally elaborate are in the planning stages as
theater circuit companies, aglow in record attendance numbers, seek
additional sites in what is considered one of the hottest markets
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The United Artists Theater Circuit of Englewood, Colo., plans to
break ground in the spring for a 12-screen theater on Brush Hollow
Road in Westbury. And, according to Kurt C. Hall, the chief
executive, the company is considering building another complex of
up to 14 screens to replace an existing theater at the Sunrise Mall
in Massapequa.
</P>
<P>
   Regal Cinemas of Knoxville, Tenn., one of the largest theater
operators in the nation, has selected Route 58 in Riverhead for a
16-screen theater that would be its first on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade
group based in North Hollywood, Calif., 1.39 billion movie tickets
were sold in 1997 compared with 1.34 billion in 1996; gross revenue
rose to $6.4 billion from $5.9 billion and the net number of
screens rose to 31,865 in 1997 from 29,731 in 1996, the largest
one-year increase on record. Figures for 1998 are not yet
available. Industry spokespeople say that rising movie attendance
reflects the popularity of films like ``Titanic'' but also has
everything to do with making theaters exciting places to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus Loew (the theater owner and film producer) once said,
`I sell tickets to theaters, not movies,' '' said Barrie Lawson
Loeks, the newly elected chairwoman of the theater owners
association, and the president and co-owner with her husband, Jim,
of the Loeks Star-Theaters chain, based in Grand Rapids, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have tried to bring back to the business is a sense of
excitement, a higher level of service and the idea that you should
feel the price of the ticket was worth it just to be in the
lobby,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the appeal of the new theaters is a relatively recent
development in theater design. The arrangement, called stadium
seating, allows all moviegoers to have unobstructed views of the
screen by placing each row about a foot higher than the row in
front. Seats themselves are plush and high-backed. They rock and
come with retractable arm rests that have cup holders and trays to
hold snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple screens under one roof _ as many as 30 in some
complexes _ not only offer a huge variety of fare but also allow
big hits to be scheduled on several screens, virtually guaranteeing
seating and providing a choice of show times.
</P>
<P>
   Also, huge curved screens extending wall to wall and floor to
ceiling and the latest sound technology give theatergoers an
illusion of being participants in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw `Titanic' in a theater that had stadium seating, it
was like being on the boat, almost to the point of being
disconcerting when it sank,'' said Edgar A. Knudson, senior vice
president for advertising at National Amusements, based in Dedham,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held company owns theaters on Long Island in
Commack, Hicksville, Brookhaven, Valley Stream and East
Farmingdale. National is renovating its 14-screen theater at the
Airport Plaza Shopping Center on Route 110 in East Farmingdale,
even though the theater is only two years old. Stadium seating is
being installed throughout, and expansion to 23 screens is also
under discussion, Knudson said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that construction was expected to begin next summer on
an 18-screen theater with stadium seating in central Suffolk, but
said he could not disclose the location because the deal had not
yet been completed.
</P>
<P>
   The first theater on Long Island with stadium seating was Hoyts
Ronkonkoma Cinema 9, which opened in October. The Australian-based
Hoyts Cinemas Corp., whose U.S. headquarters is in Boston, has
built 17 theaters with stadium seating throughout the country the
last two and a half years, said Joanne Berberan, director of
marketing for Hoyts. ``We conducted a survey and found people all
wanted the four S's _ stadium seating, high-backed seats,
wall-to-wall screens and good sound,'' she said.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Although Long Island already has several theaters with 14 or
more screens _ known as megaplexes _ the density of the region and
its excellent demographics ``make it a very strong market for
theater development,'' said Dan Zelson, a principal of Charter
Realty and Development in Greenwich, Conn., which brokered the
Regal deal in Riverhead. The theater is scheduled to go into the
431,000-square-foot Riverhead Centre shopping center, but
construction has been delayed until the settlement of litigation
initiated by local merchants who are challenging a zoning change
for the shopping center developers.
</P>
<P>
   Zelson predicted that Regal, which has 3,563 screens at 404
sites, will build five to 10 more theaters on Long Island the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corp. also expects to add more
theaters. The Manhattan-based company, formed last May with the
merger of Loews/Sony Theatres and Cineplex Odeon Corp., operates
425 moviehouses with 2,750 screens in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, its 15 complexes include an eight-screen theater
at Roosevelt Field in Garden City and 10 screens at the site of the
former Roosevelt Raceway in Westbury. Several additional sites are
under consideration, said Kenneth B. Benjamin, Loews' senior vice
president for real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The new Stony Brook theater, which is expected to draw 1.5
million patrons a year, is the first Loews on Long Island with the
lavish lobby and stadium seating typical of the newest moviehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept is to bring the elegance and glamour of theaters
built in the 1920s and 1930s back and to bring these elements to
the current theaters so they become special places to go,'' said
Eric J. Hugger, a principal of Fishbeck, Thompson, Carr &AMP; Huber of
Grand Rapids, the architect of the Stony Brook theater. Half the
firm's design work now involves movie theaters, Hugger said, noting
that ``architecture and design have become as much a part of the
moviegoing experience as the movie itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Art Deco theater in Stony Brook has a 160-foot-long lobby
that is topped by a 48-foot atrium. Two 150-foot-long corridors,
each with a concession stand, lead from the central core to
individual theaters ranging from 112 to 467 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby contains a concession stand with its own kitchen.
Customers can munch on freshly prepared chicken wings, French
fries, tacos and other treats. They can also watch previews of
upcoming features in the lobby while waiting for their show to
start. It even has a concierge.
</P>
<P>
   The theater, which is in the Brooktown Plaza shopping center,
replaced a 25-year-old theater that had only three screens. When an
adjoining bowling alley relocated last year, Loews seized the
opportunity to expand, said Daniel H. Serota, vice president for
construction at Nathan Serota &AMP; Sons of Valley Stream, which owns
the 30-acre shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   Serota said the new theater would bolster traffic for his other
tenants, a Waldbaum's supermarket and a Marshalls department store,
which until now have been the draw for other retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new moviehouses are increasingly becoming the anchor
tenants for shopping centers, taking on a role traditionally held
by department stores and supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a shopping center to be successful, it has to give people
more reasons to come, and you do that by offering them
entertainment,'' said Peter L. Levine, a shopping center developer.
</P>
<P>
   His company, Levcom of West Paterson, N.J., is building the
800,000-square-foot Airport Plaza in East Farmingdale, where the
14-screen National Amusements theater occupies 20 of the center's
91 acres. The theater opened in October 1996. A Staples
office-supply store and a Modells Sporting Goods store opened late
last year. A Home Depot will be completed by June.
</P>
<P>
   Levine said he was also negotiating with tenants that specialize
in building so-called entertainment centers, which combine a
restaurant, a sports bar and game rooms. By adding theme
restaurants and other family entertainment, ``we can appeal not
only to shoppers, but to everyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AMC Entertainment, a theater operator based in Kansas City, Mo.,
carries that idea a step further by building what it calls
``entertainment-themed retail centers,'' where large-store
retailers like Home Depot and Marshalls are not even wanted.
Satellite stores include only entertainment-oriented outlets like
book and record stores and restaurants. ``And the megaplex is the
anchor,'' said Brenda Nolte, a company spokeswoman.

 &HT;    Georgia's Roy Barnes ready to govern
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Roy Eugene Barnes takes over as Georgia's 80th
governor Monday with a nod to the century that's ending and an eye
on the one to come.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney and veteran state lawmaker, Barnes brings a
knowledge and appreciation of history to his new job, but at age
50, he'll also be Georgia's first baby boom governor. He grew up in
the south Cobb County town of Mableton when it was still largely
rural, but his views were largely shaped by the explosive growth of
the Atlanta suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' priorities for his first legislative session as governor
will include some traditional political issues _ a tax cut and
education improvements _ as well as a problem that could dominate
state government in the early part of the 21st century: managing
traffic and growth in the Atlanta region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see quality of life, and how we deal with congestion and
growth, being a dominant issue that will continue more than one
year,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   He has a tough act to follow in Zell Miller, who leaves office
as one of the most popular governors in state history. In fact,
Barnes might not even be governor if Pierre Howard, who is stepping
down as lieutenant governor, had chosen to seek higher office last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Howard decided to quit politics, and Barnes, who had
finished a distant third in the 1990 Democratic gubernatorial
primary, won his party's nomination last summer and then defeated
Republican Guy Millner in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has no single item on his agenda this year that is likely
to capture the public imagination the way Miller did in 1990 with
his promise to start a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a high-profile issue, but it's a solid list of
political goals to try to achieve,'' said Georgia State University
political scientist Michael Binford.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Barnes' proposals will probably be easy to implement,
such as his campaign promise to cut property taxes. He will ask the
Legislature this year to double the existing homestead exemption,
and wants to increase it to $50,000 over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   To shore up school discipline, another of his campaign themes,
Barnes will seek funding this year to open more alternative schools
for disruptive pupils, and to offer after-school programs for
middle school students whose parents want their child to
participate. Barnes also is expected to begin a study to determine
the best way to give teachers more authority to boot troublemakers
out of class.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' campaign promise to reform managed health care will
probably take a tough political fight. Doctors and hospitals
generally support his view that patients should have a wider choice
of physicians, but insurance companies and some business groups are
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal likely to have the greatest long-term impact,
though, will be Barnes' effort to establish a regional
transportation authority aimed at reducing traffic and air
pollution in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Poor air quality has caused a freeze on most federal highway
money for the area, and business leaders fear that access to
inexpensive land for development, which has spurred suburban
growth, is being threatened by nightmarish traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' commitment to address these problems comes in part from
his experiences growing up in Mableton, and from his days in the
state House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Barnes' family had diary cows and ran a general store
where local folks did much of their shopping for everything from
groceries to shotguns. Barnes would hop on a Greyhound bus in
Mableton and ride to downtown Atlanta to watch the Legislature in
action.
</P>
<P>
   His father told him about the trains that used to run from
Mableton to Atlanta every hour, and other Cobb residents described
riding a trolley downtown from the Marietta Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the things I heard about, that folks talked about, I
draw on those experiences and those times in forming what I think
ought to be the role of urban Georgia,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   As a state senator in the 1980s he served on the Growth
Strategies Commission, which tried to plot a course for the state
to avoid many of the pitfalls of suburban sprawl. Most of the
panel's recommendations have been ignored over the last decade, but
Barnes hasn't forgotten them. Today he cites the state of Maryland,
with its ``Smart Growth'' guidelines to contain sprawl, as a model
of good planning.
</P>
<P>
   Also during the 1980s, Barnes sponsored legislation to protect
the state's lakes and rivers. His environmental record was
considered so strong that he was endorsed by the Georgia Sierra
Club in 1990, the first time he ran for governor, and again last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to setting up a regional transportation authority,
Barnes is asking the Legislature for $1.9 million this year to
study a rail line that would run from Marietta to Lawrenceville,
connecting communities across the northern suburbs to one another
and to Atlanta via the MARTA north line. He also wants $3 million
in state funds to help start a bus system in Gwinnett County.
</P>
<P>
   In order to establish a regional transportation authority,
Barnes will need cooperation from many local governments. ``It goes
beyond jurisdictions and neighborhoods, and counties can't do it,''
Binford said. ``It's going to take statewide leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   If Barnes can convince local leaders to cooperate, he could set
a precedent for them to work together on other regional issues such
as water and sewers, managing growth, and consolidation of
government services, Binford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you build up those relationships, it's easier to tackle
additional problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond untangling traffic, Barnes believes better public
transportation would help knit the Atlanta region back together.
When he was young, he said, people in Mableton and other towns
around Atlanta felt connected to the city as the destination for
major shopping trips, business and entertainment. Today, people in
Mableton and other suburbs don't have to go to Atlanta if they
don't want to _ and many don't want to because of traffic and other
hassles.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring that regional connection is ``good from the
transportation viewpoint, and it's also good from the social and
policy viewpoint,'' Barnes said. ``We have common problems, and the
days when we could go to the suburbs and leave all the urban
problems behind are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   By tackling the problems of growth, traffic and pollution,
Barnes is focusing on matters that are less sexy than, say, a
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the environmental governor is not initially as
appealing,'' said Charles Bullock, a political science professor at
the University of Georgia. ``It takes a while to pay its
dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes acknowledged that some problems are too big to be solved
in four years _ or even eight years if he wins a second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even taken office yet, and it's too early to worry
about my legacy,'' Barnes said. ``But there are several thorny
problems I anticipate we're going to address while I'm governor. I
hope that's what I'm remembered for.''

ISLANDERS LOOK TO FUTURE, AND SEE A GOALIE THERE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Far from Long Island, where for the fifth straight season the
New York Islanders are nowhere close to making the playoffs, there
is help in Canada for the struggling franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Luongo, the Islanders' first-round selection in the 1997
National Hockey League draft, is biding his time in the small towns
of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. Widely considered to be
the best goalie in juniors, the 19-year-old Luongo led a moderately
talented Canadian junior national team to a world championship
silver medal last week and was named outstanding goaltender of the
tournament. In a few years, the Islanders expect him to be leading
them to the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a reason he was the highest drafted goalie ever,''
said Mike Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general manager. ``In
time, we believe that he can be an elite goaltender. His
performance in the world juniors last week proved that.''
</P>
<P>
   Luongo, who was picked fourth over all in the draft, was invited
to the Islanders' training camp last September and played in
several preseason games. He flashed a deft glove hand, had
lightning-quick feet for a 6-foot-3-inch, 190-pounder and showed
intense concentration. But there were technical aspects he had to
improve.
</P>
<P>
   So after an inconsistent month in camp with the Islanders, a
disappointed Luongo was sent back to the juniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, I was disappointed not to make the team,'' Luongo
said by telephone from his home near Montreal on Friday. ``I
thought I might have had a chance to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   If Luongo were a little older, he would be closer to Long
Island, with the Islanders' minor league team in Lowell, Mass. But
players must be 20 to play in the American Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Luongo took an ordinary Val d'Or team to the Quebec
Major Junior Hockey League title and a berth in the Canadian junior
championship, the Memorial Cup. Named the league's top prospect,
Luongo posted a 27-20-5 record and a 3.09 goals against average in
54 games last season, respectable numbers considering the defense
in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Luongo would have preferred to have made the NHL this year, but
he now agrees that returning to the juniors was the right decision.
He was not ready for the NHL. Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the issue of a contract standing between Luongo
and the Islanders. Luongo's agent, Gilles Lupien, and the Islanders
failed to work out a deal by Oct. 1, the deadline to sign with a
junior team and still be eligible to be called up to the NHL during
the season. Several people close to Luongo said the sides had
reached an agreement in principle since then, though many details
remain open. Lupien met with Milbury on Friday in Montreal, and it
is expected that Luongo will sign a three-year deal worth about
$2.25 million later this month.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Luongo has been having a season he will not
soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Luongo lay flat on his back on the ice in
Winnipeg, Manitoba, as the Russian junior national team piled up in
front of him, celebrating the overtime goal that gave it a 3-2
victory over Canada in the championship game. The disappointment
overwhelmed Luongo. Reaching the final was a proud moment for him
and for the Canadian team, which had been embarrassed the year
before. But for the ultracompetitive Luongo, second was not good
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best experience of my life,'' Luongo said. ``It was
high pressure, playing against the best players. But even though we
won the silver, I was very disappointed. I wanted to win a gold
medal. That's why you go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordie Clark, the Islanders' director of player personnel, who
deserves much of the credit for selecting Luongo, attended the
tournament. ``He made several key saves at key times,'' Clark said.
``He was their best player. Roberto took an average Canadian team
and gave them a chance to win a gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   When Luongo returns to the juniors this week, the pressure will
again be on him. During the two-week world championship tournament,
he was traded from the struggling Val d'Or to a contending team,
Acadie-Bathurst of New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an Italian immigrant father and an Irish-Canadian
mother, Luongo speaks English, Italian and French. He grew up in
St. Leonard, a town north of Montreal known as Little Italy, and
began playing hockey at the age of 8. He always wanted to be a
goalie, but his parents, Lina and Tony Luongo, insisted that he
first learn to skate. A few years later, when Luongo was cut from
his peewee team, he became a goalie. His idol is Grant Fuhr, the
St. Louis Blues goalie, ``because of his spectacular glove saves,''
Luongo said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many future NHL goaltenders from Quebec, at 15 Luongo
joined Montreal-Bourassa, a midget team that has produced the
Devils' Martin Brodeur, the Toronto Maple Leafs' Felix Potvin, the
Los Angeles Kings' Stephane Fiset and the former Islander Eric
Fichaud, among many others. Under the direction of the goalie
coaches Mario Baril and Francois Allaire, a longtime assistant
coach with the Canadiens and most recently the Mighty Ducks of
Anaheim, Luongo began showing signs of potential greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaching in Montreal for goaltending is excellent,'' said
Allaire, who coached the Colorado Avalanche star Patrick Roy when
he played for the Canadiens. ``The athletes have never been so
good, too. The best players in Quebec, when they are young, want to
be goaltenders. Not many players can say, `I'm as good or better
than any goalie in the world at my age.' Roberto can.''
</P>
<P>
   One look at Luongo's gangly frame and his size-15 feet, and it
is obvious that he possesses the physical attributes. But all of
his coaches agree that it is his intelligence that sets him apart.
While playing for Acadie-Bathurst, Luongo plans to take
correspondence courses from a college in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders have no plans to rush Luongo, but even the most
conservative predictions have him playing some, if not most, of
next season with them as Tommy Salo's backup, though he may start
the season in the American Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting drafted so high, yeah, there's pressure on me,''
Luongo said. ``But if you're going to play the game at this level,
you have to deal with that. I haven't proven anything in the NHL
yet, but hopefully I will.''

 &HT;    WELLSTONE SAYS HE'S 'SKEPTICAL' OF CLINTON CHARGES
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., says he is
``skeptical'' that the impeachment charges against President
Clinton warrant his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone's comment, one of the strongest indications of a
probable vote since the senators swore Thursday to ``do impartial
justice'' at Clinton's trial starting this week, was made on CNN's
``Larry King Live'' Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still would argue that what the president's done is not a
threat to the freedom and the liberty of people in the country,''
Wellstone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the question of whether he should be removed is another
question. I'm skeptical about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone predicted that a ``number of us'' will move to dismiss
the case as soon as both sides have presented arguments and before
any witnesses are called.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he's an impartial juror in the Clinton impeachment
case, Wellstone said, ``I certainly will listen to everybody make
their case and I will make a judgment as to whether they've
marshaled evidence for their point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know, this is a political process as well,'' he said.
``I mean, we're jurors, but this ... is a political thicket.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone also urged that the Senate conduct all trial business
in public, not behind closed doors. That issue was not covered in
Friday's bipartisan agreement on procedures for the trial's opening
phase.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone said he is sponsoring a motion to require a public
deliberation on whether to convict or acquit. Rules dating to the
impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 call for the
senators to reach their verdict behind closed doors.

HOW THE CHAMPIONSHIP YANKEES REMAINED INTACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernie Williams will be back with the Yankees when they open
spring training next month, and the team that won 125 games and a
World Series title last season will remain virtually intact. For
about five minutes on the morning of Nov. 25, however, Albert Belle
was a Yankee and Williams' career with the team was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' lineup for 1999 would have looked much differently
if Belle hadn't suddenly backed out of an oral agreement, those
involved in the contract negotiations say. If Belle hadn't changed
his mind, Williams likely would have signed with the Boston Red
Sox. If Belle hadn't changed his mind, the Yankees never would have
given Williams the sort of huge offer they had refused to extend
for years.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-paid players in the game have been the likes of Ken
Griffey Jr. of Seattle and Belle _ players whose skills are
quantified easily with statistics. Griffey already has 350 career
home runs at age 29, and if he remains healthy, almost certainly
will challenge Henry Aaron's record of 755 and eventually be voted
into the Hall of Fame. Belle has 30 or more home runs and more than
100 runs batted in for seven consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 30, has never produced such numbers: He has never hit
30 home runs in any single season, never driven in more than 102
runs. When he turned 27 in 1995, his career high in RBIs was 82;
when Griffey was 27, he had averaged nearly 100 RBIs for nine
seasons. Griffey is a dominant player; Belle is, too. Williams
wanted to be paid like a dominant player, and as the Yankees tried
attaching a dollar value to his ability over the last four years,
they didn't think of him in that way. After Bob Watson, the
Yankees' former general manager, offered Williams a four-year, $24
million contract in 1996, Watson said Williams was ``a good player,
but not a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Boras, Williams' agent, would argue to the Yankees or
anyone that he spoke with that Williams was, in fact, an elite
player who was improving.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has batted better than .300 for four consecutive
seasons, winning the American League batting title in 1998 with a
.339 average, played a crucial part for championship teams in two
of the last three years _ and, Boras noted, Williams is a center
fielder and a switch-hitter. There are many good run-producers
playing left field or right field, but few center fielders capable
of driving in 100 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the consensus within the Yankees' organization was
nearly unanimous when Williams applied for free agency in October:
There was no way George Steinbrenner, the principal owner, would
give Williams a seven-year contract. Brian Cashman, the Yankees'
general manager, sought possible options as Williams talked to
other teams.
</P>
<P>
   After Williams met with the Arizona Diamondbacks on Nov. 11,
Boras reached an understanding with Jerry Colangelo, the
Diamondbacks' managing general partner, of what it would take to
sign Williams without any formal offer being made; later, the
Yankees were told by the owners' labor relations committee that
Arizona had been willing to give Williams an eight-year, $100
million contract, with much of that money deferred. Boston offered
a $91.5 million package 12 days later.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had refused to alter their offer of $60 million to
Williams and became comfortable with the notion of signing Belle,
in spite of his volatile history. Yankees Manager Joe Torre played
golf with Belle on Nov. 16, and Torre and Cashman liked what they
heard and saw. Belle assured them he would be more fan friendly,
that he would not disrupt their clubhouse. Riding in Belle's
Mercedes-Benz, Cashman noticed that the car was spotless. ``He is a
very structured individual, locked into his routine,'' Cashman
said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance? ``October is dessert month for Albert,'' Cashman
explained. ``It's the only month he eats desserts. He's working out
all the time _ he had hand flexors in the Mercedes.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras advised Williams that the time to make a decision was at
hand and arranged a meeting with Steinbrenner and other club
officials for the afternoon of Nov. 24. It was during that
conversation that Cashman's beeper activated; returning a message,
he learned that the Baltimore Orioles had joined the bidding for
Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Angelos, the Orioles owner, had read of the Yankees'
interest in Belle. ``If the Yankees signed Belle,'' said Angelos,
``I thought that was going to be a serious, serious problem. I
didn't relish the idea of him batting in the middle of that
Yankees' lineup _ with those other hitters around him, he would've
been a destructive force. Not that Williams isn't a first-rate
ballplayer, but offensively, I don't think there's any
comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelos' strategy was offensive and defensive: Lure Belle to
Camden Yards, where the slugger could exploit the cozy confines,
``where he might hit 60 home runs for us,'' and keep him away from
the Yankees. ``I figured that if we signed Belle, the Yankees would
probably re-sign Bernie. Or Boston would sign Bernie, and the
Yankees don't get either guy. But I didn't want them getting
Belle.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between Williams and Steinbrenner ended well, with
the owner saying, ``Bernie, you came here, you talked to me, and I
really have to think about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras walked into the room believing the Yankees would not
increase their offer. ``But when George said that, I felt there was
a chance,'' Boras recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But Steinbrenner wasn't ready to increase his offer to Williams
by 50 percent, and at around midnight, Cashman called Belle's
agent, to extend a five-year, $60-million offer. Cashman and Belle
spoke directly at about 11 a.m. on Nov. 25, and according to
Cashman, Belle said he would be willing to reach an agreement if
the Yankees made an adjustment to their offer: Rather than an
annual salary of $12 million over five years, how about an annual
salary of $13 million _ which, at that time, would've matched the
highest in baseball _ over a four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman, fearful about losing both Williams and Belle to
division rivals, was thrilled. He told Belle he thought this
proposal was workable, that all he needed was Steinbrenner's rubber
stamp on the agreement. Steinbrenner quickly gave his approval, and
Cashman called Arn Tellem, Belle's agent, to complete the details.
</P>
<P>
   But Tellem's voice sounded stilted to Cashman: Something had
gone wrong. Belle was having second thoughts, Tellem explained.
Cashman exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, Cashman would learn the Orioles had offered a
five-year, $65 million contract _ $13 million a year _ with $15
million deferred. Cashman had to call Steinbrenner and tell him
Belle had changed his mind. ``It made me look like a fool with
George,'' Cashman said, ``and he wasn't happy.'' Later, Belle
explained to Cashman that he had reservations about being the focal
point of the New York news media.
</P>
<P>

DOCTOR LIVES OUT LIFE DEPICTED IN ``PATCH ADAMS''
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY KAREN MAESHIRO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANCASTER _ Forget Patch Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Elton, a 68-year-old orthopedic surgeon who dresses
as a clown for charity and entertains patients with a yo-yo he
keeps attached to his belt.
</P>
<P>
   To Elton, the funny bone is as important as any other, so he
performs tricks for his patients _ young and old alike _ and dons a
rainbow wig, red nose and baggy jumpsuit for medical society
fund-raisers and health fairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm just a doctor who can be serious, and is serious,
in treating patients. But at the same time I appreciate the value
of a sense of humor and use it in my treatment of patients,'' said
the bearlike, 6-foot-2 doctor, who makes his hospital rounds in a
loose cardigan and blue suspenders, his eyeglasses hanging from a
cord around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Elton's efforts get applause from the real Hunter ``Patch''
Adams, the unconventional Virginia physician suddenly made famous
by actor Robin Williams' portrayal in the hit movie ``Patch
Adams,'' as well as from the medical establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone who puts any love or humor into the world is
doing extremely important public health medicine,'' Adams said in a
phone interview. ``Throw away the Prozac and Xanax, pick up a clown
nose and go out and love people, and serve humanity with joy and
laughter.''
</P>
<P>
   At UCLA Medical School, students at all levels get classes in
bedside manner, understanding patients and when humor is
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an important role for humor,'' said Dr. Michael
Wilkes, senior chairman of the school's medical curriculum. ``There
are certain times you don't want a doctor dressing up as a clown.
It doesn't mean we have to be dead serious. Everything has to be in
a proper context.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a physician, Elton took up the yo-yo six years ago,
and clowning two years later, after more than three decades as a
surgeon, mostly in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something he likes to do,'' said Joan, his wife of
46 years. ``He always has been a little young at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Elton learned to yo-yo after a son gave him an Eddie Bauer model
one Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, I'll try to learn it, and I did, and one
thing led to another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elton now owns more than 40. His favorite is an SB2, made from
aircraft aluminum, with ball bearings around the shaft. One like it
was taken along on a space shuttle mission.
</P>
<P>
   Elton even traveled to San Francisco to visit SB2 designer Tom
Kuhn at his yo-yo store, but Kuhn was out.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor bought a leather holster in which he keeps his yo-yo
as he makes his rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Elton can't recall when he first performed for a patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have just happened one day,'' he said. ``It was
something that evolved. I started doing tricks. As I got better, I
started to show people.''
</P>
<P>
   His 10 tricks have accompanying stories. Crime fighter Yo-Yo Man
does around-the-world swoops to knock out the bad guys. A
space-alien yarn involves spinning the yo-yo horizontally like a
flying saucer.
</P>
<P>
   If a child has a broken arm, Elton will show him a yo-yo trick
and remark, ``If I can do the yo-yo trick, I can fix the arm.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the yo-yo doesn't accompany him into the operating room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rarely do them before surgical operations. There's a certain
time to be serious,'' Elton said. ``I do them frequently in the
office after I put casts on or when I treat kids, or in the
hospital on rounds, I show patients tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Patient Alice McDowell, hospitalized last week with a broken
leg, first saw Elton's yo-yo skills when her son and grandson were
visiting her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anyone that good with a yo-yo,'' said
McDowell, 62, of Palmdale. ``He looked at my grandson and said,
Hey, let me show you something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often wondered what the little pouch was on the side of his
belt. I thought it was for a tape measure. He flipped it open and
flipped the yo-yo out and went to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was here with their mouths open. We couldn't believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elton started clowning about four years ago. He rented a clown
outfit and passed out balloons at the Los Angeles County Medical
Association's annual barbecue to benefit the Children's Center of
the Antelope Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Then his wife made him a costume of his own, a
red-and-white-checked jumpsuit with a ruffled neckline. Red, yellow
and blue pockets arrayed down the front hold yo-yos and candy, and
provide his clown name: Pockets.
</P>
<P>
   In August at the Antelope Valley Fair auction, he showed up in
clown costume to bid for 4-H and FFA youngsters' livestock. Elton
also clowned at a cardiology group health fair and a fund-raiser
for the Lancaster homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't dressed up like a clown on hospital rounds, but he
said he might to visit the pediatric ward after a gift from his
office staff for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to keep a red nose on,'' Elton said. ``My office
gave me a professional round, red nose with a glue that cements on
the nose, and it's washable.''

 &HT;    Black farmers may reap cash for injustice claims, but some fear
it comes too late
 &HT;    By Peter Scott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Instead of the usual crops of soybeans and peas,
thousands of black farmers, mainly in the South, may soon reap a
harvest of greenbacks.
</P>
<P>
   But for many of the farmers, who say they were victims of 15
years of discrimination in federal farm programs, it may be too
little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman of Washington, D.C., gave
tentative approval last week to a consent agreement that will pay
about 5,000 black farmers nationwide an estimated average of
$200,000 apiece, including $50,000 in cash, said Alexander Pires,
an attorney for the farmers. He said the settlement in the
race-discrimination lawsuit also includes tax payments and
reimbursement for unfairly assessed U.S. Department of Agriculture
debts.
</P>
<P>
   Black farmers not included in the decision could end up
receiving as much, or more, as they take their claims to an
independent arbitrator or file separate lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman has set a March 2 hearing for a final decision on the
settlement, and has ordered the farmers to come to court so he can
hear from them firsthand regarding the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He can expect plenty of feedback from the farmers, many of whom
claim the damage to them goes far beyond what the settlement would
provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The proposed settlement) is a shock to the American sense of
fairness,'' said Eddie Slaughter, a South Georgia farmer who is
vice president of the national Black Farmers and Agriculturalist
Association. ``They are telling black farmers that for all the
suffering they have endured at the hands of the government, it is
worth about $3,572 a year, or $150 a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Taylor, a national spokesman for black farmers, cites
examples like the black farmer in Mississippi who lost his leg in a
farming accident and, despite developing a prosthesis that allowed
him to operate his tractor, found himself labeled handicapped and
inelligible for federal loans. He is now facing foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   And in Georgia, Taylor said, a dairyman undergoing dialysis was
denied loans, so he sold some cows in order to have enough cash to
get by. Now he's facing criminal charges because the USDA claims it
held title to the cows as collateral for previous loans.
</P>
<P>
   Other farmers were so far in debt they could see no way out,
said Taylor. He said he knows of three black farmers who committed
suicide because they lost their land.
</P>
<P>
   Some 600 black farmers from Georgia and 14 other states filed
the $2.5 billion lawsuit in 1997 against U.S. Secretary of
Agriculture Dan Glickman and the USDA. The farmers allege that
since 1983, the agency has discriminated against them in the denial
of farm loans, crop subsidies and other farm program benefits
administered by the Farm Service Agency and its predecessors, the
Farmers Home Administration.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the farmers contend, they lost potential farm
income, and sometimes, their farms.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers charged that the USDA was part of an effort to
systematically erase them from the agricultural landscape. The
number of black farmers has declined from 925,710 in 1920 to fewer
than 18,000 today. The black-owned farm acreage has dropped from
15.6 million acres to less than 1million.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman has acknowledged that black farmers were treated
differently than white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Breckenridge of Oklahoma is among those who says he
suffered from unfair treatment. When he began dealing with the USDA
in 1986, he had a gross worth of $2.5 million. Since that time, the
61-year-old former vocational agriculture teacher and member of the
Oklahoma Board of Regents has seen his wealth diminish. His family
once farmed 3,000 acres, but now has less than 200 acres. He once
had 1,300 head of cattle. He now has just 160.
</P>
<P>
   He said the USDA wouldn't give him the kind of support it gave
other farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I signed up with the USDA, I could borrow little or no
money from the banks,'' said Breckenridge, who began farming in
1964 shortly after schools were desegregated in Oklahoma and many
black teachers lost their jobs as all-black schools shut down.
``The USDA had my equipment and land as collateral. Our area had
four or five bad crop years. Up until this day, I've never received
operating funds from USDA.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Head of Georgia is among farmers who have spent years
trying to hang on despite their inability to get the same kind of
loans available to white farmers. ``I may be able to save my land,
but I won't be able to put my farm in full production. The
agreement will allow me to secure my land,'' said the 44-year-old,
third-generation farmer in Pavo, just south of Thomasville.
</P>
<P>
   Head faces foreclosure on a 150-acre farm that has been in his
family for 100 years. He hopes the agreement will help convince his
local creditor to delay a $6,500 payment that is due on part of his
$42,000 debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lay down crying and we wake up crying. We are trying to
hold on,'' said Head's 71-year-old mother, Jessie Mae.
</P>
<P>
   Head has always wanted to farm and learned by the side of his
late father, Willie Sr. He bolstered his skills with a degree in
business administration and economics from Albany State University.
</P>
<P>
   But Head has gotten so far in the hole that when his wife and
father died within two weeks of each other last September, he had
no insurance to bury them. His wife was in intensive care with
pneumonia when he was told his farm was about to be foreclosed.
Friends and supporters helped raise more than $11,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (settlement) will help keep us around, but we won't be
productive. It's almost like being comatose _ you are breathing but
not living,'' said Head.
</P>
<P>
   He said he fears many black farmers challenging alleged racial
discrimination will face retaliation from whites in the farming
community who are struggling, but for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture Tommy Irwin said he will not
tolerate acts of discrimination. If such acts are committed, he
said, ``Heads will roll.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that it is very difficult to make up for
past unfairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that can be paid to overcome the existence of
discrimination in the past,'' Irwin said. ``I suspect farmers who
have lost their land, (by now) it's in somebody else's name and
there is no way you correct that misjustice.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Sherrod, executive director of the Albany field office
of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, an ombudsman agency for
small and minority farmers, worries that despite the settlement,
the same problems for black farmers will eventually resurface. Many
of the USDA officials who were the targets of the black farmers'
complaints remain in the positions they held before the suit was
settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a moral or just conclusion to what black farmers and
their families have endured over the past 50 to 60 years,'' said
Gary Grant, a Virginia farmer who is president of the national
Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association.

 REAL ESTATE: AFTER A ROLLER-COASTER YEAR, OPTIMISM 
</HEADLINE>
 (lb) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Real estate executives used words like ``frothy,''
``giddy'' and ``frenzy'' to describe the investment market in the
New York area during the first half of last year. Fueled by a
seemingly unlimited amount of capital from Wall Street, real estate
investment trusts and private operators bid against one another for
available properties, driving up prices.
</P>
<P>
   Today the froth has flattened and nobody is feeling very giddy.
At the same time there is little gloom.
</P>
<P>
   Although the capital markets took the industry on a
roller-coaster ride last year, the fundamentals of the commercial
real estate business remain strong and most executives are
optimistic about the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the top end of a real estate cycle, so 1999 should
be a good year, but not a spectacularly good one,'' said Dennis
Yeskey, managing director of the real estate services group at
Deloitte &AMP; Touche, the accounting and consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cohen, president of Williams Real Estate, said, ``What
we saw last year was a historic disconnect between the rental and
sales markets.'' Cohen said that commercial rents remained strong
even as the prices of properties fluctuated in response to activity
in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news,'' said Raymond Torto, a principal in Torto
Wheaton Research, an econometric analysis firm specializing in real
estate, ``is that real estate has made it in capital markets,''
allowing financing to be raised by public stock and bond offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is also the bad news,'' he added, noting that events in
foreign countries can affect projects and prices in the United
States, regardless of local market conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate investment trusts, known as REITs, were the first to
feel the market's sting, as disenchanted investors drove the prices
of their shares down, preventing the REITs from selling more shares
to finance a continuation of their buying binge. The overall stock
market also took a sharp lurch downward in August, raising fears of
layoffs in financial services companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those worries have not entirely evaporated despite the market's
strong showing in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw that public markets for real estate are quick to go
down and slow to recover,'' said John Bralower, the president of
Sonnenblick-Goldman, a real estate finance company. ``The
underlying market for the properties did not go down as much as the
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, recessions in Asia, currency problems in Russia and
the near-collapse of a huge American hedge fund shook up the bond
market in the United States, leaving Wall Street firms unable to
convert into securities the mortgage loans they had already bought.
</P>
<P>
   With widespread uncertainty about the future pricing of
mortgage-backed securities, liquidity dried up and sales ground to
a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Properties that had been for sale were withdrawn from the market
because of uncertainty and declining bids. According to
Insignia/ESG, a real estate brokerage and services company,
properties that were pulled off the market included the 1.5
million-square-foot building at 450 West 33rd St., the 1.1
million-square-foot structure at 237 Park Ave., at 45th Street, and
the million-square-foot building at 450 Lexington Ave., at 45th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   One transaction that did close reflected the abrupt drop in
pricing. Witkoff Group acquired the Woolworth Building, at 233
Broadway, for $133 million after having successfully reduced its
original _ and accepted _ bid of $157 million. The seller was
Venator Group, the successor to the old Woolworth Corp.
</P>
<P>
   All the time the capital markets were churning, most of the real
estate fundamentals were strong, with office vacancies low and
rents stable or climbing. According to a year-end report prepared
by CB Richard Ellis, a brokerage company, the overall office
vacancy rate for Manhattan was 5 percent, with the Midtown North
subdistrict, generally defined as 32nd to 59th Street, river to
river, down to 3.2 percent availability.
</P>
<P>
   Asking annual rents for all classes of multitenanted commercial
buildings in Manhattan reached $36.60 a square foot in the fourth
quarter, according to the report, compared with $29.96 at the end
of 1997. Brokers reported that some prime buildings in key
locations, such as 9 West 57th St. and the General Motors building
at 767 Fifth Ave., were fetching as much as $70 to $75 a square
foot.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these strong fundamentals, most real estate leaders
say they are cautiously optimistic as they head into 1999. The
relative lack of new construction in Manhattan will keep office
rents high, they say, although builders in New Jersey are betting
those rates will drive some companies to their developments along
the Hudson River waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   The big layoffs that were feared in the financial services
industry have not materialized, reducing the chances that a lot of
office space will be dumped back on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, new industries, most of them computer-related, are
growing in Manhattan and injecting new life into what had been
declining postindustrial neighborhoods, such as the garment
manufacturing buildings in the teens between Fifth and Sixth
avenues and the old printing buildings near Hudson Square on the
west side.
</P>
<P>
   The companies in these new industries are contributing to the
numbers and pace at which new leases are being signed. ``Leasing
velocity over the last two years has been 25 to 30 percent better
that the best years in the past,'' said Stephen Siegel, the
president of Insignia/ESG.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said he expected the pace to decline somewhat in 1999,
but added that some large space users, including the NASDAQ stock
trading operation and the German-based publishing company
Bertelsmann, are actively looking for new quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Liquidity will return to the market, real estate executives say,
as Wall Street firms sell their portfolios of existing loans and
start looking for new business. ``People talked about a capital
crisis, but it was really a pricing crisis,'' said John Lyons,
chief executive of Granite Partners, a real estate financing firm.
``People were not lending, because they did not know what price to
lend at.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that one result of the crunch is that money is more
expensive for acquirers and developers than it was. He said that
interest rates are 2 percent to 2.5 percent above Treasury
securities with a similar maturity, compared with 0.8 percent to
1.0 percent above during the summer. But he said that was still
more favorable than the 3 percent to 3.5 percent premiums that
prevailed three years ago as the market was developing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the crunch in October, he said, lenders were
demanding rates of up to 7.50 percent, regardless of how low the
rates on Treasury securities fell.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates and the need for buyers to put up more
equity capital means that the prices paid for property are expected
to be somewhat lower than in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The return on equity is higher than debt,'' said Barry Gosin,
the chief executive of Newmark &AMP; Company Real Estate, explaining
that stockholders want more income for their greater risk than the
relatively more secure bondholders.
</P>
<P>
   Gosin said if a purchaser has to put up 30 percent to 40 percent
equity _ rather than the 5 percent or 10 percent that was
sufficient when money was flowing out of Wall Street _ it limits
the ability to bid. ``You have to pay less for properties,'' he
said. ``It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosin said that prices appeared to be down 10 percent to 20
percent, although not many transactions have closed since the bond
market crunch began in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Some real estate executives say the markets have functioned as
they are supposed to, cutting off funding before too many people
joined the party. ``The capital markets exerted discipline and
prevented overbuilding,'' said Mitchell Hersh, the president of
Mack-Cali Realty, a New Jersey-based REIT. ``It is usually supply
that puts markets out of balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The furious pace of the first half of 1998 many have contributed
to the slowdown in the later months, said Thomas Benneville,
managing director of LaSalle Partners' investment banking group.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys in my business had the year in the bag by
July,'' he said. ``So when the markets got hit, they had no reason
to move quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But he predicted that sales activity would pick up quickly this
year. ``The real estate fundamentals are still good,'' he said,
``and you have to eat in '99, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed. Darcy Stacom, an investment sales specialist at
the Cushman &AMP; Wakefield brokerage company, said that the Wall
Street firms started getting back in the market late last year and
that she expected sales to be brisk early in the year. ``We are
going to see a lot of product for sale in the first quarter,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   One sale that closed late in the year was that of Exchange Place
Center, a 700,000-square-foot waterfront office tower in Jersey
City, for $175 million. The building was bought by BBV U.S. Real
Estate Fund III, a German investment group, from Prudential Real
Estate Investors.
</P>
<P>
   In the leasing market, brokers say they expect the landlords in
New York to continue to have the upper hand, but few are predicting
sharp increases in rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been better times to be a tenant,'' said James
Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a tenants'
representative. ``Rents will go up marginally, but you will see
less free rent, less work and tougher lease terms,'' he said,
referring to provisions that give tenants a period of no rent and
require landlords to contribute to renovation costs.
</P>
<P>
   But some brokers say the summer's dips in the stock market have
cooled the demand for space. ``During the summer there was an
intense frenzy for every piece of space,'' said Mitchell Steir, an
executive vice president of the Julien J. Studley brokerage
company. ``That has leveled off. Now the landlords do not have two
backup deals for every bit of space.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the decline in the price of REIT shares sharply slowed
their pace of acquisition, it did not prevent Reckson Associates
Realty Corp. from becoming the second of the suburban-based REITs
to enter the Manhattan office market. The first was Vornado Realty
Trust, which acquired Mendik Co.'s midtown portfolio in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Reckson reached agreement to acquire Tower Realty, a
Manhattan-based REIT with seven buildings totaling 2.3 million
square feet, including Tower 45 at 120 West 45th St.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan was for Reckson to be an equal partner with
Crescent Real Estate in an acquisition vehicle called Metropolitan
Partners. But when Crescent pulled back, Reckson went ahead with
the acquisition for a total of $680 million in cash, stock and
assumption of debt, with Crescent remaining as a passive investor.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rechler, the president of Reckson, described the
acquisition as a strategic one for the company, which already has
properties on Long Island, in New Jersey and in the area north of
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A report by CIBC Oppenheimer, a securities brokerage and
research firm, on the deal said that ``With Reckson having
established a dominant position as an owner/operator of office and
industrial real estate in the suburban New York market, the Tower
acquisition appears to be a natural extension to fill a geographic
void in its portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   But it warned that Reckson needed to find managers for the Tower
properties who are both savvy about the Manhattan market and able
to participate smoothly in a suburban-oriented company.

buildings north of 42nd Street, the vacancy rate is about 2
percent, which is something that we have not seen since 1980,''
said Steven Swerdlow, senior managing director of CB Richard Ellis'
metropolitan area office.
</P>
<P>
   With prime space scarce, some tenants are even leasing space
they do not currently need in anticipation of even higher rents and
stiffer terms in the future. ``We are seeing a mentality of taking
an extra 10,000 square feet of space and warehousing it,'' said
Robert Emden, an executive managing director of Grubb &AMP; Ellis, a
brokerage company. ``Tenants are concerned about protecting
themselves down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the last office-market peak in the 1980s, there is very
little building going on in Manhattan, and the few projects under
way or announced are largely preleased. The Reuters news and
financial information company will occupy most of the
856,000-square-foot building, designated 3 Times Square, being
constructed at the northwest corner of Seventh Avenue and 42nd
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The largely complete 1.6 million-square-foot building at
Broadway and 42nd Street, designated 4 Times Square by its
developer, the Durst Organization, will be divided between the
Conde Nast publishing company and the Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &AMP;
Flom law firm.
</P>
<P>
   The financial services company Bear Stearns will be the
principal tenant of a 1.1 million-square-foot building under way on
Madison Avenue between 46th and 47th streets.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter will be the principal tenant and
co-developer of a million-square-foot building to be built on what
is now a parking lot on Seventh Avenue between 49th and 50th
streets. The co-developer is Rockefeller Group, the former
proprietor of the landmarked Rockefeller Center and still the part
owner and manager of four buildings along the west side of Avenue
of the Americas facing the center.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown
</P>
<P>
   High-Tech Firms Keep on Arriving
</P>
<P>
   Because the midtown market has reached saturation, ``the
overflow tenants will have to flow downtown,'' said Cohen of
Williams Real Estate. ``Because that is where the double-digit
vacancies remain.''
</P>
<P>
   During the year, Guardian Life Insurance Company of America said
it would move from the Union Square area to 7 Hanover Square near
the lower tip of Manhattan, while Empire Blue Cross &AMP; Blue Shield
decided to leave midtown for 461,000 square feet at One World Trade
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing for downtown was that there was no
disaster in financial services,'' said Siegel of Insignia/ESG. He
said that the developing infrastructure of what was once canyons of
office buildings _ new stores, hotels and other amenities _ was
making the area attractive for people who like to live near where
they work.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the city-subsidized Plug 'n' Go program and other
incentives have attracted computer-based companies to downtown
buildings that have been rewired and outfitted for tenants who need
robust telecommunications, power and cooling services.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this activity has accelerated the relocation of numerous
small high-technology companies from places like Vancouver,
Cambridge, Mass., and New Hampshire to downtown,'' said a report by
CB Richard Ellis.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Suburbs
</P>
<P>
   The Action Is in New Jersey
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is where the commercial development action is, both
along the west bank of the Hudson and in the middle of the state in
Morris and Somerset counties. Private developers are leading the
way, with REITs _ even those with development sites _ holding back
because of uncertainty about how financial analysts will value
projects that have no current income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street does not know how to handle development projects,
so the REITs will not build on speculation,'' said Donald Eisen,
executive managing director for the suburban market at Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield. Eisen said that between 2 million and 3 million square
feet of office space was under construction in the state, which he
said was not a major addition to a 140 million-square-foot market.
</P>
<P>
   SJP Properties is building three speculative office projects in
Morris, Somerset and Mercer counties totaling 900,000 square feet
and has an agreement with the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey to build a 1.2 million-square-foot office building on the
waterfront in Hoboken.
</P>
<P>
   Although he will not start the Hoboken project without an anchor
tenant, Steven Pozycki, the company's president, said his
relationship with pension funds insulated him from the ups and
downs of capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funds followed us in the early 1990s when we were doing
acquisitions and since 1994 when we resumed development,'' he said.
``Our investors know we will take reasonable risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Pozycki said that with Class A office buildings replacing
abandoned industrial plants on the Hudson, the west bank of the
river should be regarded as part of the Manhattan market. But it is
a place that is cheaper and where it is possible to erect buildings
with large floors suitable for trading floors.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Stern of Hartz Mountain Industries is developing
projects as varied as an office building at 90 Hudson St. in Jersey
City, the TriBeCa Grand Hotel at Sixth Avenue and White streets in
Manhattan and an 1,100-car parking deck in Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He said the problems in the credit markets actually helped
established developers like himself, who can finance their own
projects if necessary. ``It's the new guys who get hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speculative building is also under way on Long Island, where
Greenway Plaza Office Park, a Melville developer, started a
100,000-square-foot office building on Pinelawn Road in Melville in
July. Fortunato Development of Bohemia followed in October with a
60,000-square-foot building at Airport Corporate Center in Bohemia.
And in December, Tilles Cos. began a 100,000-square-foot building
at Gateway Office Park in Woodbury.
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester County, a rising vacancy rate, caused by the
relocation of large companies such as IBM and Nynex, is squelching
any plans to build. The country's overall vacancy rate stood at 18
percent in 1998, compared with 16.5 percent the year earlier. In
the business hub of the county, White Plains, vacancies were 30
percent, up from 28.3 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The small amount of building that is under way in Connecticut is
not taking place in the traditional office center of Stamford, but
in places like Shelton, Norwalk and suburban New Haven. One of the
most ambitious projects is under way in Bridgeport, where the city
is embarked on a $1 billion, 3-million-square-foot waterfront
commercial and retail development.
</P>
<P>
   Retail
</P>
<P>
   Low Vacancy Rates and Higher Prices
</P>
<P>
   A low vacancy rate _ under 5 percent, according to some reports
_ and strong demand for prime locations has driven up rental rates
for retail space in Manhattan, with parts of Madison Avenue among
the most expensive in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``A store with 4,000 square feet on the ground on Madison Avenue
commands in excess of $500 a square foot,'' said Faith Consolo, a
senior managing director of Garrick-Aug Associates, retail real
estate specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Consolo said that the strong economy and the appeal of New
York were behind the demand. ``New York is where retailers want to
be,'' she said. And the appeal is not just glamour. Sales at a
Manhattan store can be as much as those of five or six suburban
mall stores combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is competition for every location that comes on the
market,'' said Alan Victor, an executive vice president of Lansco
Corp., a retail brokerage company. He said the demand came from
stores already in Manhattan, such as the Gap, Old Navy and Coach,
which added locations, and from newcomers such as Restoration
Hardware that are opening their first stores.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to high-fashion stores that cluster on Madison and
Fifth avenues and are slipping into areas like SoHo and the
Flatiron District, chains that deal in more mundane items and have
been successful across the country are looking to New York for
expansion, brokers report. They say that Wal-Mart and Target are
particularly interested in breaking into this market.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels
</P>
<P>
   Room Rates and Occupancy Rise
</P>
<P>
   The city's hotels continue to be essentially full, with profits
rising as operators raise room rates and developers scour the city
for sites to build new hotels or convert existing buildings for use
as hotels.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by E&AMP;Y Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate
Group, occupancy last year was 83.0 percent compared with 81.5
percent in 1987. The average room rate in the city reached an
all-time high of $192 a night, which was a 9.5 percent increase
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue per available rooms, a key indicator of financial
performance, also reached an all-time high of $159, according to
the report, which was a 11.5 percent increase over 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The financial performance of hotels in New York far outstrips
the rest of the nation, said Sean Hennessey, head of the new York
hospitality practice of PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting and
consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessey said that in 1991 annual income per room after
expenses in New York was $9,179, compared with $4,977 for the rest
of the country. In 1997, the figure for New York was $32,008
compared with $10,100 elsewhere. ``New York is three times more
profitable than the average for the United States,'' Hennessey
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there are 16 hotels with a total of 3,256 rooms
under construction or renovation, or considered likely to go
forward, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers survey. Nine more
hotels, with 3,540 rooms, are in the planning process, and 17 more,
with as many as 6,480 rooms, are in the proposal stage.
</P>
<P>
   But rapidly rising room rates may be too much of a good thing,
Leventhal said. ``With the average daily rate for Manhattan
approaching $200 a night,'' he said, ``Manhattan could be pricing
itself out of some market segments such as wholesale and leisure
travel as well as lower-rated corporate travel.''

EXTORTION CASES EXPOSE MOB TIES TO ROGUE WORKERS' COALITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For three decades, construction companies in New York
City have been bedeviled by groups claiming to represent minority
workers battling racial bias in the billion-dollar industry. The
groups, dubbing themselves ``community coalitions,'' have often
staged stormy protests that forced contractors to offer them jobs
in return for labor peace.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, the convictions of six coalition leaders in two
separate extortion cases exposed a new aspect of some of the
groups: secret deals between three rogue coalitions and the Mafia
to extract payoffs from contractors.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, William Marshall, a Mafia defector, testified that
the Gambino crime family and two major coalitions joined forces to
shake down contractors in the mid-1990s. The mobsters, he
explained, encouraged coalition leaders to stage disruptions at
construction sites. Gambino family members then stepped in,
Marshall said, promising the contractors that they had the muscle
to end harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The mobsters and the coalition chiefs got thousands of dollars
in payoffs from each collaboration, according to testimony by
Marshall and several contractors who were government witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Although they were paying both sides, Marshall said, the
contractors apparently did not know that the coalition leaders and
mobsters were allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Gambino family, Marshall said, took protection money for
supposedly helping the contractors reduce demands by coalitions.
And prosecutors charged that coalition bosses, in exchange for
canceling protests, were given no-show jobs as ``community
coordinators'' that paid up to $900 a week. Prosecutors asserted
that the coalition leaders did little to find jobs for black and
Hispanic workers. Lawyers for those leaders, however, insisted that
they had found jobs for many minority workers.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall claimed, without citing proof, that two other Mafia
factions in the New York area, the Genovese and Lucchese families,
obtained similar payoffs by using minority coalitions ``to stir up
trouble'' with contractors.
</P>
<P>
   That case, tried in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, also
provided a partial preview of testimony about construction rackets
that may be offered later this year against John A. Gotti, 34, who
is accused of being the acting boss of the Gambino family. Marshall
said that Gotti, son of the imprisoned Gambino boss, John J. Gotti,
got a $50,000 protection payoff in 1995 from a company that was
being extorted simultaneously by a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision that every contractor in New York City has to make
is whether or not to seek protection by employing people from the
coalitions,'' said Joel Aurnow, acting president of DeFoe
Construction Co., whose officials acknowledged at a trial and in
interviews that the company hired representatives of coalitions and
employed a reputed Gambino mobster to deal with the groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't arm your employees, and you can't rely on the police
to provide all the protection you need,'' Aurnow said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Aurnow and other contractors said the coalition disruptions
occurred mainly at construction sites in the city and rarely in the
suburbs or upstate. But six construction companies involved in the
two cases denied paying mobsters for protection.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, a federal jury in Manhattan convicted four coalition
leaders on charges of extortion conspiracy: Trevor Johnson, 58,
whom prosecutors described as the leader of Brooklyn Fight Back;
two of his top aides, Robert Carnes, 29, and Daniel Hunter, 27; and
Dennis McCall, 33, of United Construction Labor Coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charged that the two groups had worked in concert
and with mobsters on extortion plots.
</P>
<P>
   Payroll records and testimony revealed that Johnson was paid
$800 to $900 a week for almost a decade by Tully Construction Co.
of Flushing, Queens; McCall was paid $140,000 in recent years by
HHM Construction Co. of Maspeth, Queens; Carnes was paid $65,000
from 1995 to 1997 by DeFoe Co. of Mount Vernon, and Hunter was paid
$4,500 in 1997 by Sullivan and McGrath Construction Co. of
Amityville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In a related case in U.S. District Court in White Plains, on the
same day as the guilty verdicts in Manhattan, Michael Sims, 32, and
James Sims, 28, who together ran the Black and Latin Economic
Survival Coalitions, known as BLES, pleaded guilty to extorting an
unspecified amount of money from a company that had a $25 million
state contract for repairs on the Grand Central Parkway in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they obtained evidence against Michael and
James Sims, who are stepbrothers, after they were heard on
court-authorized telephone taps discussing deals with Gambino
mobsters. No testimony was presented at hearings when the Sims
brothers pleaded guilty, and prosecutors declined to give further
details of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The six defendants in the two cases had jobs as community
coordinators or were seeking them from contractors. Each defendant
faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 when
sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   None of the defendants in Manhattan testified. Through
cross-examinations of government witnesses and in summations,
defense lawyers argued that their clients legally earned their
salaries from construction companies by resolving disputes among
rival coalitions and by obtaining jobs for black and Hispanic
construction workers in an industry they described as entrenched in
racism.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers contended that the defendants were recruited for
help in publicly financed projects that require companies to
include minority employees on their work force. Stephen Scaring, a
defense lawyer, maintained in closing arguments that mobsters, not
the coalitions, extorted payoffs only for themselves and that the
Mafia had no influence on the labor organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement and government officials say that since the
1960s, legitimate and questionable coalitions have sprung up in the
city, advocating greater employment of minority construction
workers.
</P>
<P>
   James McNamara, who helped draft city and state regulations on
the hiring of minority workers for public construction jobs, said
that about a dozen loosely organized coalitions exist in the city.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders of most of these groups are out to feather their
own nests and do very little to increase job opportunities for
minorities,'' said McNamara, a former consultant to law enforcement
agencies on labor racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   But he cited two long-established coalitions, Harlem Fight Back,
which is not affiliated with Brooklyn Fight Back, and the Chinese
Construction Workers Association, for unblemished records in
helping minority workers.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Haughton, director of Harlem Fight Back, said the ``teaming
up of these convicted coalition people with organized crime has
discredited legitimate efforts to bring about fair play for blacks,
Latinos and Asians in this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, contractors created much of the problem by
inventing the position of community coordinator. ``The real
criminals,'' Haughton said, ``are contractors who pay off phony
coordinators even if they have to use strong-arm methods to keep
legitimate folks away from construction sites and to undermine our
efforts against racism in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than 50 years, criminal and civil cases have shown that
five Mafia families based in the New York area have engaged in
construction corruption, mainly through influence in labor unions.
Before the recent extortion cases, the authorities suspected that
the Mafia cooperated with several coalitions, but found no
substantial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state investigators say they had been hampered in
uncovering shakedowns by spurious coalitions primarily because
contractors and their employees feared retaliation if they
cooperated with law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But an investigation by state and federal agencies that began in
1995 with a look at Gambino family gambling and loan-sharking rings
uncovered evidence involving Brooklyn Fight Back, the United
Coalitions and BLES. In telephone taps and bugs on Gambino members,
investigators heard about meetings and alliances being arranged
with coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   Those leads helped implicate the three coalitions and allowed
investigators to track down the construction companies that were
being victimized.
</P>
<P>
   At the Manhattan trial, Marshall admitted that in the early
1990s, he became an associate, or worker, for a Gambino crew in
Westchester County that prosecutors say was run by Gregory DePalma,
an acting capo, or captain.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, 33, a ruggedly built man who is a former Westchester
County jail guard, said that in 1996 he accompanied DePalma, 66,
his son, Craig DePalma, 32, whom prosecutors have identified as a
Gambino soldier, and other Gambino mobsters to three or four
meetings with Johnson and members of his coalition at the
Baychester Diner in the northeast Bronx. The purpose of the
meetings, he said, was to discuss payoffs from DeFoe Co.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after being indicted with John A. Gotti and both
DePalmas in a broad federal racketeering case, Marshall pleaded
guilty and agreed to testify for the government in return for a
reduced sentence. He is now in the Federal Witness Protection
Program, awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Sarita Kedia, a lawyer for the younger Gotti, characterized
Marshall as a perjurer. ``Marshall did not have any direct
relations with Gotti,'' Ms. Kedia said. ``His testimony is
unreliable and cannot be believed.''
</P>
<P>
   In final arguments at the Manhattan trial, Mylan Denerstein and
Mark Godsey, the federal prosecutors in charge of the case,
maintained that the term ``community coordinator'' was a
construction industry code word for extortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coalitions have created an environment where a contractor
can't do business in New York City without paying for protection,''
Godsey said.

 &HT;    Baptist leader called to judgment
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ He grew up poor but ambitious, loved by a
grandfather who raised him in church, but virtually abandoned by a
fast-living father who never married his mother.
</P>
<P>
   He became a preacher at the tender age of 20, dazzling his
backwoods Georgia congregation with a silky delivery and deft touch
that eventually propelled him to national prominence in one of the
country's largest African-American denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he would attend receptions at the White House, mix
with members of Congress and serve as one of the spiritual leaders
of his people.
</P>
<P>
   But there appear to be two sides to the life of the Rev. Henry
Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   According to newspaper reports, by the time he was 30, Lyons had
stumbled through two divorces and had two children out of wedlock.
Eventually, he adopted a lavish lifestyle that included a
Rolls-Royce, a Mercedes Benz and a $700,000 waterfront home
purchased with a woman who was not his wife. There are allegations
that he took money intended for rebuilding burned-out black
churches for his personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' contradictory career goes on display this week in a
Florida courtroom. The president of the National Baptist Convention
USA is charged with stealing millions from businesses affiliated
with the group and spending it on luxury items.
</P>
<P>
   He could be sent to prison for 30 years on the state charges,
which include racketeering and grand theft. This spring, Lyons, 56,
is scheduled to face federal charges of tax evasion, fraud and
money laundering that could bring an 800-year prison term and $25
million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our position that he entered into legitimate business
deals and made his best effort to promote the products'' of the
companies contracting with the convention, said Denis de Vlaming,
one of Lyons' attorneys. ``The businesses got what they paid for,
which amounted to a celebrity endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   De Vlaming said Lyons would not comment prior to his trial.
</P>
<P>
   In several public statements, Lyons has admitted to unspecified
``mistakes and misjudgments,'' but has blasted the charges as
racially motivated. The media, particularly the St. Petersburg
Times newspaper, has singled him out because he is an affluent
black man, he has said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you trying to imply?'' Lyons asked reporters at one
news conference. ``That blacks in this country cannot be successful
and live well?''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons has not always lived a high lifestyle. He was born in
Gainesville, Fla., and raised by his grandparents, who took him to
the church where his grandfather, a laborer, was a deacon.
According to an exhaustive St. Petersburg Times profile, Lyons was
a bright child with a winning personality and ambitions to rise
from the limited horizons he found in segregated Gainesville of the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school in 1960, he attended all-black
Gibbs Junior College in St. Petersburg. While a student, Lyons
became an assistant pastor at a St. Petersburg church, taking over
for one summer when the pastor took a leave. Lyons went on to
Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Fla., and then to the
Morehouse School of Religion in Atlanta, where he enrolled in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   While still a student, he accepted his first pastorship, serving
at Abysinia Baptist Church in Brunswick, where he commuted from
Atlanta one Sunday a month.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, he moved to a larger church, Macedonia Baptist in
Thomaston, where he became the full-time minister. His new church
quietly pressured Lyons to marry. He quickly took a bride,
according to the Times, but the marriage ended within a couple of
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons married again within months, this time to a 19-year-old
member of his congregation. Her family objected, and the couple
apparently never lived together. They remained married for several
years, even after Lyons moved away to run Cincinnati Baptist Bible
College and Seminary, a small school in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times report, Lyons had by this time fathered
two children with two different women in Florida, neither of whom
he married. In 1972, Lyons was called to pastor Bethel Metropolitan
Baptist in St. Petersburg. Before he arrived, he married a third
time, taking as his wife a woman he had met in Cincinnati. With his
reassuring touch and powerful oratory, he built the church
membership steadily, starting programs to help the poor and
eventually building a new sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Lyons became an officer in the Florida General Baptist
Convention, an affiliate of the National Baptist Convention USA.
Eventually, he rose to president of the Florida group and
vice-president of the national group. In 1994, Lyons was elected
president of the national convention, making him one of the
country's most prominent African-American religious leaders. That
year he sat on the dais next to President Clinton, who addressed
the group.
</P>
<P>
   According to an affidavit filed by investigators, it was in this
role that Lyons adopted an extravagant lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing deals
</P>
<P>
   After his election, Lyons entered into deals with several
corporations selling credit cards, insurance and funeral services,
telling them his group represented some 8.5 million members. The
group's own records indicate membership is closer to 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a Nashville, Tenn., bank, Union Planters, lent $300,000
to the convention in a deal in which Lyons was to market credit
cards to convention members. The deal, which later collapsed, was
based on a convention resolution that allegedly bears the forged
signature of the convention's general secretary. In the most
lucrative deal, Lyons agreed to make the Loewen Group, a giant
Canadian funeral services firm, the ``death-care provider of
choice'' for convention members. Over several years, the company
advanced $3.2 million to the convention, most of the money
allegedly winding up in accounts controlled by Lyons and Bernice
Edwards, a convicted embezzler from Milwaukee, Wis., whom Lyons
hired as a public relations specialist for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Lyons and Edwards purchased a $700,000 waterfront home
in an exclusive St. Petersburg suburb. Lyons insists the home was
bought as a ``guest house'' for the convention. He adamantly denies
having an affair with Edwards, who faces trial as his co-defendant.
In 1996, Lyons accepted nearly $250,000 from the Anti-Defamation
League, a prominent Jewish group, for distribution to black
churches burned during a rash of alleged hate crimes across the
South. In 1997, Lyons admitted he gave only $30,000 to churches,
with $60,000 going into his personal account. Lyons' attorney later
reimbursed the ADL $214,500.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' ascension to prominence took decades, but his fall came
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, while he was traveling with Edwards and other
convention officials in Nigeria, his wife allegedly ransacked the
waterfront home and set several fires. Deborah Lyons first told
police she suspected her husband was having an affair, but later
said she set the fires by accident. She has stood steadfastly by
him ever since. Despite the charges, Lyons has held onto his
presidency of the National Baptist Convention USA, and has vowed to
run again this year when his term expires. In the mostly-black
south St. Petersburg neighborhood around Bethel Metropolitan,
opinions are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Lyons is a good man who tries to help poor people,''
said Winston Logan, who works at a Caribbean restaurant near the
church. ``He got into a little mishap, but lots of people have done
lots worse. He needs a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But George Mosley, a jeweler, is appalled. ``I think he's guilty
as hell and he's playing with the name of the Lord,'' Mosley said.
``It's a sad commentary on the Christian ministry.

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A year ago, after the first reports of the
president's affair with Monica Lewinsky, Rep. Henry Hyde reacted
predictably enough, tamping down what he clearly saw as a lot of
loose, hotheaded talk about impeachment: ``You don't impeach him
for a peccadillo,'' he said then.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also said the president would not be impeached without
bipartisan agreement. He said public support was important, too.
And he promised that under his leadership, the House Judiciary
Committee proceedings would be marked by comity and bring honor to
the Congress. ``If we fall into partisan bickering, we will
disgrace this institution,'' he said in September. ``And we're not
about to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Good old Henry, whispered the Democrats, confident that the
famously fair-minded and genteel gentleman from Illinois would keep
the real partisans in check. Let the hard-liners howl at the moon,
the thinking went. Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia could hold his breath
until he turned purple but, thank God, Henry Hyde was the man in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in yet another twist in the labyrinthian Lewinsky scandal,
good old Henry surprised everyone. He opposed a Democratic proposal
that would have limited the inquiry and instead toyed with
expanding it. He argued against a censure option. And he presided
over hearings dominated by partisan attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Was this the same Henry Hyde who once had Democrats cheering his
opposition to Republican proposals on term limits? Yes, friends
said, but it was also a man whose position had hardened
considerably over the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by what he came to see as President Clinton's cavalier
attitude toward the law, the investigation and the committee, and
boxed in by Democrats who he felt had no intention of working with
him, the friends said, Hyde became convinced that he had no choice
but to push forward and impeach the president without them.
</P>
<P>
   As with some others who have gone up against Clinton, these
friends said, Hyde's reluctance gradually turned to resolve and his
hesitation to absolute certainty.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton was impeached _ without either bipartisan support
or popular approval, for behavior that did stem from what many
people dismissed as a peccadillo _ it was in no small measure as a
result of Hyde's determination to press forward.
</P>
<P>
   And now Hyde, who has lately been listening to the original
Broadway cast's recording of ``Man of La Mancha,'' is throwing
himself wholeheartedly into his new role as Clinton's chief
prosecutor in the Senate. Rep. David Dreier of California, one of
Hyde's closest friends on Capitol Hill, said the Judiciary
Committee chairman's attitude was ``If you're going to catch hell
no matter what you do, you might as well do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   After appointing a conservative team of prosecutors, Hyde was
pushing for a full trial with witnesses and fighting any effort to
truncate that process. Last week, some senators began grumbling
that they did not know who had died and made him ``Senator'' Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's resolve has been nearly unwavering from the start of his
committee's deliberations in October. Contrary to expectations that
he might be dissuaded by the Republicans' poor showing in the
November elections, his friends said, that drubbing, coupled with
persistent criticism from colleagues, had exactly the opposite
effect. If anything, it only emboldened Hyde to proceed without
worrying about the fallout, since both he and his party were
already taking some hits.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was Hyde in any way deterred by the disclosure, in the
fall, of an extramarital affair he had decades ago. A devout Roman
Catholic, Hyde spoke on the House floor of his great shame over the
relationship, but believed, too, that there is a clear difference
between a sin and a crime. ``To liken violations of the vows to
perjury,'' Dreier said, ``is just their attempt to bring about
similarities.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said Hyde had recovered from
the disclosure of his affair far more quickly than he had from a
recent incident involving the actor Alec Baldwin. On the NBC show
``Late Night,'' Baldwin said that in other countries ``all of us
together would go down to Washington and we would stone Henry Hyde
to death! We would stone him to death and we would go to their
homes and we'd kill their wives and their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin later apologized and said the bit was intended as
satire, but Sensenbrenner said Hyde, who has received death threats
and travels with four security guards, has been worried about his
family's safety ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dreier, who had lunch with Hyde on Thursday after he
presented the articles of impeachment in the Senate, said his
friend was in good spirits that day, joking, enjoying some ``real
crab cakes,'' and chatting about movies. (Hyde had already seen
``You've Got Mail,'' dismissing it as ``a chick flick,'' Dreier
said, and had tried to coax him into seeing the Adam Sandler
goofathon ``The Waterboy,'' with him this weekend.)
</P>
<P>
   Hyde is not plagued by doubts about whether he is doing the
right thing, Dreier said. ``He's just rolling with it now.''
</P>
<P>
   But for others, the transformation has been jarring _
``breathtaking,'' said Thomas Mann, director of government studies
at the Brookings Institution and an expert on Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one thinks pressure from the party's conservative base
was much of a factor. This is Henry Hyde, they said, author of the
Hyde amendment, a hero to opponents of abortion and, at 74, a man
with nothing to prove.
</P>
<P>
   His friends insist that politics is not driving Hyde at all: As
one friend said, ``What's the political benefit to doing what he's
doing? If we find one more Jane Doe, Clinton's approval rating will
be at 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., said: ``The conventional wisdom
was that it was not in our interest to proceed, so why would we
want to? To enhance Al Gore's chances? Censure would have been much
more politically expedient, but he went the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Hyde under any obvious pressure from party leaders. ``I
don't think he was under orders here,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler,
D-N.Y. ``I think he just got more determined as time went on.''
</P>
<P>
   And friends say Nadler and other Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee are partly responsible for that evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's attitude shifted as he began to despair of being able to
work across the aisle as he had originally hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt he wasn't getting cooperation from the other side of
the aisle, so in kind he decided he had to get the job done with
Republicans,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn. ``It was a
polarized committee, and he thought in the end that the Democrats
had a strategy that didn't allow for much common ground. Henry was
ultimately the leader of this polarized and partisan outcome, but
he didn't want it that way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner, who sat next to Hyde on the committee and on a
couple of occasions sat in for him when the chairman ducked out for
a moment to cool down, said: ``Henry can get his back up when he
thinks he's being used. Everything he did the partisan pit bulls
sharply criticized.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadler seemed happy to acknowledge getting under the chairman's
skin. ``Henry is a very determined guy and I think he was getting
exasperated at Democrats' not playing along,'' Nadler said,
laughing. ``We were not going to make his job any easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats on the committee said they felt Hyde was
influenced by his counsel, David Schippers, who also began his work
with an aura of bipartisanship as a lifelong Democrat but soon
adopted a hard line regarding the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, another Democrat on the
committee, said he thought he saw signs of what he called the
``bridge over the River Kwai syndrome.'' ``After a while, pride of
craft takes over,'' Frank said, ``and you just want to build the
bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   At a number of junctures, Hyde's associates said, he was
frustrated by what he came to see as Clinton's disrespect for the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is deeply offended by the president's conduct during this
entire matter'' in ways that have ``nothing to do with his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky,'' Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, colleagues said, Hyde became convinced that he
had no choice but to protect the court system that he felt would be
seriously undermined if every citizen with a skeleton in his closet
decided under which circumstances it might be permissible to lie
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   And after Hyde saw Clinton's answers to the 81 questions the
committee had put to him, several people close to him said Hyde
felt there was no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   One person familiar with Hyde's thinking over the last few
months said that ``after the nonresponsive answers on the 81
questions, he said in a meeting of fellow Republicans, `Boys, I
don't see what choice we have now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly underestimated by the White House, Hyde was, in the
end, ``critical in convincing Republicans to impeach him anyway
after the election,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They mistook a teddy-bear exterior for a soft core,'' said
Ralph Reed, the Republican strategist, who knows Hyde well. ``If he
feels strongly about something, he'll fight harder than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one can doubt that Hyde now feels strongly about the case
against Clinton.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the first roll call of the 222nd session of
the New York state Legislature, the clerk had to call Thomas
Duane's name three times before he responded, ``Here.''
</P>
<P>
   Duane, the first openly gay member elected to the conservative,
clubby fraternity that is the state Senate, had his back to the
podium. His leather chair sat empty on the Democratic side of the
gilded chamber. He was across the aisle, shaking hands with
Republicans, introducing himself to the powerful majority leader,
Joseph Bruno, in one breath, and in the next, urging him to
reconsider his denial of domestic-partner benefits to employees of
the upper house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `We'll talk,' and I take him at his word,'' Duane
said a few minutes later on Wednesday, after the ceremonial votes
starting the legislative session had been taken and the senators
awaited the call to the Assembly chamber for Gov. George Pataki's
State of the State address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We WILL talk about it,'' Duane added, ``because I won't let
up.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of representing the heavily gay neighborhoods
of Chelsea and Greenwich Village on New York City's
Democratic-dominated City Council, Duane, 43, is now firmly in the
minority. He is one of just 25 Democrats in the 61-member Senate, a
body not known for its diversity, where all but 10 members are
white and all but eight are men.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Assemblywoman Deborah Glick of Greenwich Village,
Duane constitutes an ad hoc caucus of two openly homosexual state
legislators. He is the only state lawmaker who identifies himself
as carrying HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and has just become
the nation's highest-ranking openly HIV-positive elected official
(others include a New York city councilman and a member of the
Illinois Assembly).
</P>
<P>
   It is a distinction Duane dons with delight, responding to
cracks that Bruno and other colleagues are reluctant to shake his
hand with a joke about planting kisses on conservative cheeks. A
big teddy bear of a man with a honeysuckle voice, Duane has a list
of legislative priorities likely to be non-starters in the
Republican-controlled Senate, like civil rights for homosexuals and
privacy protections for people with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno, who in 1995 derided homosexuality as an ``abnormal life
style,'' offered a ``very hearty welcome'' to Duane in his opening
remarks to the Senate on Wednesday. He declined to discuss the new
senator's arrival in an interview, though his aides have privately
grimaced about the prospect of a gay legislator waving rainbow
flags around the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's free to express his opinions as he pleases,'' said Sen.
Dale Volker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Codes Committee,
which handles criminal justice issues. ``Will it have a major
impact? I doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wary of being perceived as a one-note politician, Duane said he
also planned to lobby for campaign finance reform, aiming to
increase disclosure requirements and lower contribution limits. He
also wants to relax the stiff penalties of certain drug laws,
televise Senate debates and protect access to abortion clinics.
Those issues have been raised before by others, without success.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Duane relishes the role of the renegade, and he is
prepared to speak up whenever _ and even whether or not _ he is
asked to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it, but it's not the first time I've ever been in
this position. I have some experience being the only one,'' said
Duane, recalling his years at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania,
where, he jokes, there were ``four and a half'' gay people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a minority voice can be very powerful,'' he added,
acknowledging his limited potential as a Democrat in the Republican
Senate but focusing on the importance of being a live example of a
gay person with HIV within the halls of power. ``I don't expect
things to change overnight, but over time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For now, there is the matter of introducing himself to Capitol
staff members, like the security guard who tried to send Duane
through the metal detector with hoi polloi on Wednesday rather than
let him stream into the Assembly chamber with his fellow senators.
And setting up his office, now barren except for a pair of New York
and United States flags and a broken bookshelf holding some old
budget briefings. Truth is, nobody has yet told him which office he
will get, but Duane is hoping to keep his temporary digs _ which
belonged to his predecessor, Catherine Abate _ because he thrives
on the sunlight streaming through the south-facing windows and
enjoys the view of the skating rink outside.
</P>
<P>
   There is little formal orientation in the Capitol, where Duane,
a former stockbroker, was one of five new senators who arrived last
week (there are two other New York City Democrats, Dan Hevesi of
Queens and Eric Schneiderman of Manhattan, and two Republicans,
John J. Bonacic of Mount Hope in Orange County and Patricia K.
McGee of Franklinville in western New York, both of whom came over
from the Assembly).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glick warned Duane that the cafeteria closed at 2 p.m.,
meaning that lunch after the governor's speech would be a crispy
chicken sandwich and fries at McDonald's. Last month, Duane filled
out paperwork for his health insurance and pension, and hired two
staff members who had worked for former senators. Soon he plans to
look for a studio apartment, ``a place with my own bed, a
coffeepot, cable television,'' to cut the dreariness of the Howard
Johnson's motel where he stayed last week. And he has heard that
there are a few gay bars here, though he has yet to check them out.
</P>
<P>
   He is angling for a spot on the Codes Committee, and also wants
a seat on panels dealing with health care, the environment and arts
financing. When the work begins in earnest this week, Duane's top
task will be meeting his colleagues, who were sworn in Wednesday in
a huddle of back slapping that looked like a football team before a
big game. Some Democrats already have their arms open: Sen. Nellie
Santiago of Brooklyn, whom Duane thanked upon their meeting for
casting one of a handful of votes against identifying people who
test positive for HIV by name, saved him a front-row seat Wednesday
for the State of the State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will give him an opportunity to confront a fair amount of
homophobia,'' Ms. Glick said of Duane's new job. When she asked to
meet with all the Republican senators in 1991 to discuss civil
rights for homosexuals, Ms. Glick recalled, only three agreed; last
year, seven sat down with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably will be some people who would not want to have
any personal contact with him,'' Ms. Glick said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen DeBold, political director of the Victory Fund, which
raises money for gay and lesbian candidates nationally, said that
when Texas elected its first openly gay state lawmaker in 1992,
people switched seats so they would not be near him. Now there are
about 160 openly gay elected officials nationally, she said, which
sounds like a lot until you realize that there are almost 500,000
positions on numerous public bodies, from library boards to
sanitation commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The old-boy bastion of the state Senate was not Duane's first
choice. He ran, unsuccessfully, for the House of Representatives in
1992. But he faced term limits on the City Council in 2001, and Ms.
Glick, who represents his neighborhood in the Assembly, had no
plans to abandon her perch in the Democrat-controlled lower house.
So when Ms. Abate ran unsuccessfully for attorney general last
year, her open Senate seat provided an opportunity Duane said he
could not pass up.
</P>
<P>
   For a politician who was sometimes criticized at New York City
Hall for representing only his gay constituents, the new post
presents many challenges. The Senate district is about twice the
size of the council district Duane represented, stretching from
Wall Street through Central Park. Even as he fulfills his destiny
as a kind of gay gadfly, constantly raising the HIV-positive
perspective in the conservative Senate, Duane will also have to
scramble to set up a constituent services system, which is the
chief task of the minority Democrats, who can rarely get
legislation passed or even amended.
</P>
<P>
   Duane remains healthy and robust and says his openness has lent
force to his arguments on HIV and AIDS-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a hematite pinkie ring that binds him to his partner,
Louis Webre, Duane is not hiding. But neither is he reckless: While
many senators had their spouses by their sides during the
swearing-in, Webre was 150 miles away in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might have been a part of me that didn't want to
overwhelm them,'' Duane acknowledged. ``Let them get to know me
first.''

ANGRY AT MANAGED CARE, DOCTORS START FIGHTING BACK

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Dr. Clement Barone, a radiologist on the Upper
East Side, the final straw came when Blue Cross Blue Shield told
him it was cutting reimbursements for mammograms to $42 each. (He
charges $200.) He dropped the plan, and said he might stop
accepting all managed care soon.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barney Softness, a pediatrician on West End Avenue, said he
decided he could take no more when Oxford Health Plans suggested
that he cut costs by getting rid of the registered nurses in his
office. Instead, he told Oxford goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Byron Thomashow, a pulmonary specialist in Washington
Heights, recalled how he fought with one company for three hours to
get permission to do a procedure on a woman who was coughing up
life-threatening amounts of blood. He said the dispute underscored
why he was no longer in a managed care plan.
</P>
<P>
   While 92 percent of doctors in New York state accepted managed
care last year, it seems that a small rebellion is on. Fed up with
years of acrimonious relationships with managed care companies,
doctors, particularly those serving upper-middle-class patients,
are starting to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Many are dropping plans that have the lowest reimbursement
rates, biggest administrative headaches or represent the fewest
number of their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Others are washing their hands of the carriers, forcing patients
to pay up front and file claims the old-fashioned way, or pay the
fees themselves. Still others are looking for alternative ways to
negotiate with the companies, like forming group practices or other
professional associations that have more leverage to seek better
reimbursement rates. And hospitals are trying to fight back by
asking the New York state attorney general's office to look into
managed care company practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that a growing number of doctors are
disassociating themselves from managed care,'' said Dr. Charles
Aswad, executive vice president of the Medical Society of the State
of New York. Still more, he said, ``are being much more judicious
about looking at managed care contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is too early to quantify much of the activity, some
numbers are startling: 10 percent of the doctors affiliated with
New York Presbyterian Hospital have dropped out of managed care in
the last three months, and 50 percent have whittled the plans they
accept, said Dr. Myron Weisfeldt, chairman of the hospital's
department of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a tremendous number of physicians that to one degree
or another are beginning to separate themselves from managed care
at some financial risk to themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are signs that the movement extends past New York
City's borders: the Summit Medical Group, a 100-doctor practice in
Summit, N.J., for instance, recently dropped Blue Cross, and others
are expected to follow suit, said Dr. Greg Sachs, president of the
Medical Society of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors' opposition to managed care is on the increase
elsewhere, as well. In California, doctors have formed a group to
push their opposition, and in Texas, some are also forswearing
managed care. But experts say New York is particularly interesting
because doctors here are rejecting a system that is still quite new
and that rolled into the region at a breakneck speed in the last
few years. Chief among their complaints have been reduced fees and
more restrictions from the insurance companies on referrals and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``California had an evolution toward managed care, and we have
had a revolution,'' said Aswad. ``And that is why you hear about
these disruptions and large groups suddenly getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   This movement raises difficult questions about whether doctors
can and should expect to make the same good living they did before
the managed care movement, and whether a decision among some of the
brightest and best to drop managed care plans simply re-creates the
caste system of care that health maintenance organizations were
meant to eliminate by providing preventive care and a variety of
services.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, New York is not leaving the managed care business. The
HMO Trade Conference, a trade group, said it has not yet heard of
managed care companies worrying about a mass exodus.
</P>
<P>
   But it is just as clear that in the last few months many
doctors, who have been unhappy about managed care almost since its
introduction to the New York area, seem to be dropping out
entirely, for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, consolidation among the managed care companies
has increased, underscored by the announcement that Aetna U.S.
Healthcare _ whose tough bargaining on rates makes it one of the
least popular insurance carriers among doctors _ would acquire
Prudential Health Care. As the companies grow larger, their ability
to dictate rates and policies is likely to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Further, many companies have cut reimbursement rates
significantly in recent months, causing many doctors to conclude
that they cannot make any money by accepting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't stand it,'' said Thomashow, the pulmonary
specialist in Washington Heights. ``The thought of being put on
hold lines by people who don't know a quarter of what you are doing
to get permission for patients to go to the bathroom was
distasteful to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows he may lose patients, but he said he hoped he could
persuade some to stay, even if that means lowering their bills.
``If patients can't pay, then they don't pay,'' he said. ``There
are patients I will make less money off of than if I took managed
care, but I don't care, because it is my choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The revolt tends be led by doctors who have affluent patients
who are both demanding and willing to pay for the services if they
must. But some doctors, whose patient population is more diverse,
are trying to form groups to challenge the companies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Mount Kisco Medical Group in Mount Kisco, N.Y.,
has started to take advantage of its size _ 64 doctors under one
roof _ to negotiate with managed care companies. It has dropped
some plans that were demanding too much paperwork, said Dr. Scott
Hayworth, the group's chief executive officer. But it negotiated a
more favorable contract with others, including Oxford and Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are 64 doctors,'' Hayworth said, ``so we are lucky because
we have better negotiating power. Does that mean if you could wave
a magic wand and make managed care go away, would we? We would want
that for sure. But we make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict that more large groups will come together _
perhaps in the form of unions. But forming groups does not always
assure power.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1994 Dr. Jonas Goldstone and Dr. Saul Kaplan
formed Mid-Manhattan Medical Associates, an association of 26
doctors from various specialties who organized as a group to
arrange better ancillary services, like laboratories, and to deal
with managed care through a central business office.
</P>
<P>
   While many of their goals as a group have been met, they have
not won better reimbursement rates from insurance carriers, they
said. ``We are finding out that the projected income we expected in
dealing with managed care has not materialized,'' Goldstone said.
At this point, he added, ``A number of us are seriously considering
exiting managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone's doctor informs her he will no longer accept her
insurance plan, the options are clear: She finds another doctor or
she pays up. And if she is in a plan that partly reimburses for
visits to doctors out of the network, she files a claim.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, too, are bridling at managed care. The biggest
complaint is that companies are refusing to reimburse for the full
number of days that patients spend in the hospital, arguing that
certain illnesses can be treated in shorter stays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot overstate enough the sense of frustration within the
hospitals,'' said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York
Hospital Association, a trade group. ``We have gone from tolerance
to feverish pitch, and we are seeking help from the authorities as
well as lawmakers so HMOs stop abusing hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   The association has asked the state attorney general's office to
pursue the matter of trimming days, and the association is
contemplating lawsuits against individual companies, Raske said.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitals are also considering forming their own managed
care companies _ common among providers of services to Medicaid
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx is forming one such
program to insure children, and hopes to extend it throughout its
system.
</P>
<P>
   Most doctors say that quality of care, not their own earnings,
is driving their decisions. They argue, for instance, that when
managed care companies push for high-volume practices, it reduces
the time they can devote to each patient, teaching, reading medical
journals and working in clinics.
</P>
<P>
   They also recognize the painful reality that only middle-class
and wealthier patients are likely to have insurance plans that
allow them to choose their own doctor in exchange for a lower
reimbursement rate, typically 80 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a practice just for rich people,'' said Softness,
the pediatrician. ``That was never my plan. But I also want to be
able to give the kind of care that I think people deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   But some health care experts predict that a tiered health care
system is in the offing with a movement like this one. ``I think we
are moving toward a two-tiered or three-tiered structure of health
care,'' said Michael Lichman, senior vice president of Willis
Corroon of New York, one of the country's largest insurance
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Others, too, argue that despite a glut of doctors in the 1980s,
doctors' incomes rose higher than that of other professionals. They
contend that in a supply and demand economy, lower salaries would
have been expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If doctors say that quality will fall as reimbursements fall,
they are insulting themselves,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health
economist at Princeton University. ``The truth of the matter is
that when a group of laborers are in surplus, wages fall. They are
the only group that is unwilling to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who serve the poor, doctors fresh out of school who have
no established patient base, and doctors working in towns where one
employer dominates the market simply cannot refuse managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't drop HMOs if you have a family to feed and a dog who
depends on you,'' said Lichman. ``Patients have become used to
walking into a doctor's office and paying $10, and you can't say,
`OK, I'm back in the fee-for-service business.'''
</P>
<P>
   But as long as employers continue to offer plans that give
employees a chance to go to doctors outside their networks _ which
is likely in a strong economy _ and HMOs continue to push for
doctors to cut costs, more are likely to leave the HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear every day about other groups of doctors who are
dropping managed care,'' said Dr. Barry Chaiken, who founded the
Association of Independent Physicians in New York, a new and
growing group of doctors free of managed care. ``As managed care
comes in and insists on fee discounts of 30 percent or more,
physicians have to change their practices to survive.''

MINNESOTA SENATOR NOT SEEKING WHITE HOUSE AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota announced Saturday
that he would not seek the presidency in 2000, further shrinking
the field of Democratic contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wellstone had been considered a long shot, and he
viewed his candidacy as a low-budget crusade to press for liberal,
populist causes, he drew enthusiastic responses from audiences in
Iowa and other battleground states. At the very least he would have
been an irritant to the two more established candidates who are
preparing to run, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone, who in April was the first Democrat to set up an
exploratory committee and who has been traveling the country
seeking support since early 1997, said he had intended to run but
changed his mind because of severe back problems.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he recently ruptured a disc in his lower back and
that it had become too painful for him to follow a grueling travel
schedule as a presidential candidate and serve in the Senate. He
would face re-election to a third term in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not maintain the blistering pace of national travel,
meetings, speaking and organizing that a presidential campaign
requires for almost two years,'' Wellstone, who is 54, said in
remarks at the state Capitol in St. Paul on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he has had a long history of ``painful but
manageable back troubles'' since his days as a college wrestler but
that they were aggravated by the ruptured disc.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Saturday, Wellstone said he would not
endorse another candidate now, but he expressed enthusiasm for
Bradley and also said he would welcome an entry into the contest by
Jesse Jackson. Wellstone ran Jackson's presidential campaign in
Minnesota in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jesse Jackson gets into the race, he'll make a tremendous
contribution,'' Wellstone said. ``And I've spent a tremendous
amount of time talking to Bill Bradley, who I'm sure will have much
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone's announcement follows one by Sen. Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, who said he too would not seek the nomination. And
advisers to Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader,
said it was increasingly unlikely that he would run, now that the
Democrats stand an improved chance of winning back the House in
2000 and he would be a leading candidate for speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone said that he believed Gore was vulnerable and that he
was ``feeling glum'' about his decision but saw no alternative.
``I'm pretty disappointed about this,'' he said. ``I wanted to do
it.''

RESEARCHER FINDS AND OFFERS TREASURE AT LIBRARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Shulman's blue eyes glistened as he showed off
his most topical prize: an unused ticket to the impeachment trial
of President Andrew Johnson dated April 21, 1868.
</P>
<P>
   He picked it up at an auction in 1960 for $13 and thinks it
might be one of the few unused tickets remaining. He thinks it
might now be worth a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   But after suffering a heart attack five years ago, Shulman, 86,
gave it away to the place he loves the most, the New York Public
Library. He gave away almost everything else he valued to the same
institution _ a spelling primer from Colonial America, 20,000 old
postcards, and Bowery Boys novels the library did not have.
Thousands upon thousands of things.
</P>
<P>
   Years before, he gave the library his cryptography collection,
which included a book about secret writing published in 1518 and
comic books from World War II.
</P>
<P>
   These are only possessions. What Shulman, who wears blue jeans
and sneakers, lives for is the mental adventure the library
represents. It was there he ferreted out the earliest use of more
than 5,000 words and phrases for the Oxford English Dictionary,
which paid him when they printed the additions or modifications.
</P>
<P>
   It was also at the library that he built a plausible case that
baseball's first game was played in Manhattan, not in New Jersey _
and certainly not in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   He is a member of one of the city's most inclusive and
distinguished clubs: regular readers in the Brooke Russell Astor
Reading Room for Rare Books and Manuscripts, at the library's main
branch on Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street. The price of admission is
filling out an application attesting to a serious purpose. Users
range from people designing coffee-table books to poets seeking
inspiration in fraying Latin tomes.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Bartow, curator of rare books, says Shulman is both an
important contributor of material and one of the library's most
frequent users. ``David is what we're all about,'' she said. ``He
collects books, he researches endlessly and he writes for
publication.''
</P>
<P>
   His current campaign is to revive the reputation of Steve
Brodie, the man who declared he was the first to jump from the
Brooklyn Bridge and live. The New York Times, in its 1901 obituary,
told of how Brodie, ``on the strength of this imaginary feat,''
went on to become a saloon owner on the Bowery and start an acting
career.
</P>
<P>
   But Shulman believes that Brodie's feat was not imaginary at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Shulman spread out scores of old newspaper
stories on a library table to make the case. He had arrived by
subway from the St. Nicholas Adult Care Center in Brooklyn, where
he now lives.
</P>
<P>
   His motivation is to nail down another phrase for the Oxford
dictionary. ``To do a Brodie'' has long meant to take a dive, a
phrase sometimes applied to the stock market. But Shulman insists
that if the man did not dive, the phrase must go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in running everything down to primary sources,'' he
said. ``In other words, if you pursue the truth as far as you can,
you'll find out many times that it ain't so.''
</P>
<P>
   Painstakingly, through The National Police Gazette, The Brooklyn
Eagle and other sources, he sifted evidence against the assertion
that Brodie, a newsboy, conned reporters into believing him. He
noted that witnesses, including a police officer, testified that
they saw Brodie leap in 1886. Shulman asked, ``If he was carrying a
dummy, wouldn't anybody have noticed it? A dummy's a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded: ``Everything is alleged. No concrete evidence. I
think he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until he retired in 1956, this self-described ``Sherlock Holmes
of rare books'' designed puzzles for newspapers. In World War II,
he deciphered Japanese codes. He was long one of the world's top
Scrabble players. He never married, saying he never had the time.
He said his only relatives are two nieces whom he has had no time
for since they tried to stop him from giving his treasures to the
library.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but your relatives can be predators,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The library is different. There he can show friends his
impeachment ticket, or have millions of potentially fascinating
intellectual treats delivered to him. He can time-travel in the
manner of his mentor, Norbert Pearlroth, the chief researcher for
``Ripley's Believe It or Not,'' who pored through hundreds of books
virtually at random in search of odd facts.
</P>
<P>
   But Shulman, who carries myriad scribblings on index cards in a
plastic bag, came to see his mentor as less than rigorous.
``Instead of believing it,'' he said, ``I believed it not.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he bubbled happily off on a kaleidoscope of things. Did you
know there is no difference between a split finger fastball and a
forkball? Or that the marquess of Queensberry did not personally
write the rules of boxing that are named after him?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Al Sharpton and Norman Siegel, executive
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, pledged Saturday to
fight together against Gov. George Pataki's proposal for a
statewide database containing information on the DNA of all felons.
</P>
<P>
   They said the plan, outlined in the governor's State of the
State message last week, threatened privacy, exceeded any
legitimate law enforcement needs and could ultimately be used to
discriminate against those who fit a general genetic profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major mistake to equate DNA samples with fingerprints
and to say they are used solely for identification purposes,''
Siegel said at a news conference at Sharpton's National Action
Network in Harlem. ``DNA is that, but it is also much, much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, who has maintained that the criminal justice system is
racially biased, added that the proposal posed a particular threat
to black and Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't become just numbered, medically identified pawns of
the state,'' he said. ``We must have the right to live our lives,
but not as suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   The joint appearance by the city's most flamboyant black
advocate and its most visible white civil libertarian, was
sprinkled with sentimental references to similar alliances that
blossomed during the civil rights movement of the 1960s but have
infrequently surfaced since.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel raised rainbow visions, declaring that with ``black,
white, brown and yellow together,'' this year would be ``a defining
moment in the history of civil liberties in the city and state.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sharpton told his supporters in the audience that
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. would be proud of his alliance with
Siegel and the civil liberties group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the same lineage,'' he said. ``We fought governors in
the South before and we'll fight governors in the North now.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said the availability of DNA testing and technology had
spurred attacks on individual rights in New York from several
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir suggested last month that DNA
samples be taken from every person arrested and fingerprinted.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani backed him and went further, saying he would
not object to DNA testing and fingerprinting of all newborns.
</P>
<P>
   On a state level, DNA samples have been taken for the last three
years from people convicted of sexual and violent crimes. In those
narrowly defined categories, Siegel said, law enforcement
authorities can make a case for DNA sampling because saliva and
blood, the sources of the DNA samples, are likely to be found at
crime scenes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sharpton and Siegel have fought on the same side of the
barricades frequently in the recent past, particularly in
protesting police brutality and Giuliani's policies. Last month,
both Siegel and Sharpton shared the microphone at an AIDS
activists' rally at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But their motivations have sometimes been at odds. Siegel, for
example, defended a white police officer who was disciplined for
riding on a Labor Day parade float that parodied a racial murder.
The defense argument focused on free speech. Sharpton appeared as a
witness for the same officer at a police hearing, but he said the
punishment was the mayor's attempt to curry favor with blacks.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of DNA testing, the two expressed willingness not
only to join forces but to merge their styles.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Siegel tried to engage the crowd of Sharpton's
supporters by getting them to repeat his slogan, ``DNA is d.o.a.''
The audience didn't catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel tried again, with a bit more zest. ``DNA is d.o.a.'' he
called out, nodding toward the silent audience of a few dozen
people in encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton got to his feet and grabbed the lectern. ``Let me show
you how to do this, Norm,'' he said, and roused the crowd to chant
the slogan with fists raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is DNA?'' Sharpton called out in conclusion. ``D-O-A!''
roared the people in response.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we just saw is a perfect example of why we need
coalitions,'' Siegel said in reclaiming the microphone. ``A lawyer
alone ain't worth very much. A preacher alone ain't worth very
much. But a preacher and a lawyer together _ watch out.''

LEON GOLDSTEIN, 66, COMMUNITY COLLEGE PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leon Goldstein, the gentle, genial, politically savvy
president of Kingsborough Community College of the City University
of New York and a leading candidate for New York City schools
chancellor in 1995, died in his sleep Friday night at his home in
Manhattan, a CUNY spokesman said. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's skill in building a political base for Kingsborough,
which is in Brooklyn, in New York City and beyond, and his
willingness to seek efficiency for CUNY at a time of economic
belt-tightening, brought him to the attention of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the mayor endorsed him as his candidate for schools
chancellor, and over the opposition of the board president, Carol
Gresser, put together a majority of the school board to support
him. But in the face of questions about whether he had dispensed
political patronage and about his willingness to be forthcoming
about his own resume, Goldstein withdrew his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   He was later cleared of the patronage accusations by the
Brooklyn district attorney's office. A separate CUNY investigation
cleared him of wrongdoing, except for one ``minor'' transgression
in which he used college stationery to support a Brighton Beach,
Brooklyn, real estate development.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last year, he said he was disappointed that he
was forced to withdraw due to the accusations. ``My time would have
been spent responding to the allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, his time at Kingsborough had been happy and
productive. ``I'm a very, very happy man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Borough Park, Brooklyn, the son of immigrants from
Poland, Goldstein stayed close to his roots. He attended two CUNY
schools _ City College and Brooklyn College _ for his bachelor's
and master's degrees, and was involved in CUNY's central
administration, as dean for community colleges and as deputy
chancellor and acting chancellor between 1981 and 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Amid budget cutbacks in 1992, Goldstein took on the unenviable
task of leading a committee of CUNY presidents and faculty in
recommending ways to improve academic planning. The resulting
report, which called for colleges to cut programs that duplicated
those on other CUNY campuses, caused a firestorm of protest among
faculty and other CUNY officials. Although most of the report's
specific suggestions were not adopted, campuses like Baruch
embraced some of its principles.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's strong administrative skills, his wide political
connections and his personal charm made him often mentioned as a
possible candidate for other offices. But his primary career _ and
his pride and joy _ was at Kingsborough, which he built from a tiny
college parked in a collection of merchant marine barracks into an
innovative and successful institution housed in a sparkling complex
on 72 acres nestled between Jamaica and Sheepshead Bays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the Robert Moses of CUNY,'' said Jay Hershenson,
Kingsborough's vice chancellor for university relations.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsborough offered the usual programs in liberal arts,
nursing, secretarial skills and business, but it also offered a
program in marine technology, replete with a former Coast Guard
cutter outfitted to conduct research and an aquarium with small
sharks and other fish. Construction on additional buildings was to
begin soon.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein also developed programs for a wide range of students,
from 5- and 6-year-olds who attended a special summer program to
teenagers who attended the college's High School for the Sciences
to a core of some 800 senior citizens who took tuition-free
classes. His ``college now'' program, which offered college
preparatory classes to high school seniors who could not pass
CUNY's placement tests, is now offered in 25 high schools and being
expanded throughout the CUNY system with backing from Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein drew support and financing for Kingsborough through
his active involvement in Brooklyn political and educational
circles. He was close to Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden
and to William Thompson Jr., the former deputy borough president
and now president of the school board.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, even as he defended the need for remedial
classes for students, Goldstein would not criticize Giuliani for
his denunciations of CUNY and its remedial programs. Just last
month, he sent CUNY a letter saying he planned to retire as
president of Kingsborough in September.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein is survived by his wife, Mary De Piano Rothlein; a
son, Michael of New York City; a daughter, Lisa Miller of Mahwah,
N.J.; and two sisters, Toby Alden of Brooklyn and Marilyn Alsofrom
of Royal Palm, Fla.

 &HT;    Watch your pennies if you plan on sending mail
 &HT;    By Mike Morris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The bad news is the cost of sending first-class mail
goes up today. The good news is the increase _ to 33 cents from 32
cents _ is the smallest of 10 over the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the new cost of stamps only a penny more?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just enough revenue to cover our costs and expenses in
the forseeable future,'' said Michael Miles, spokesman for the U.S.
Postal Service's Atlanta region. ``The Postal Service is by mandate
required to break even over a given period of time. We believe that
1 cent will bring in enough revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service petitioned the Postal Rate Commission, an
independent body of private citizens appointed by the president and
confirmed by the Senate, in July 1997, and the penny increase was
approved last May, Miles said.
</P>
<P>
   There are several things to remember about the new postal rates:
</P>
<P>
   _ The new 33-cent stamps went on sale last week. Where they are
unavailable, you can obtain stamps bearing the letter ``H,'' which
also cover the new postage rate.
</P>
<P>
   _ All 32-cent stamps will need to be accompanied by a 1-cent
``makeup'' stamp.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you forget and send mail with only a 32-cent stamp, it will
still be delivered, but with postage due, Miles said. The mail will
be returned to the sender if the recipient declines to pay the
extra penny.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you dropped mail Saturday into a box that doesn't have
Saturday pickup, that mail will also be treated as ``postage due.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The rate for sending up to a half-pound by Express Mail
Next-Day Service also increases today, rising a buck to $11.75,
while the two-pound rate increases to $15.75. The Priority Mail
rate for up to two pounds goes to $3.20 from $3.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rate for mailing a postcard remains the same at 20 cents.
</P>
<P>
   _ The second-ounce price for first-class mail weighing more than
an ounce actually decreases today, to 22 cents from 23 cents, but
it won't be much consolation because relatively few first-class
letter exceed an ounce.

 &HT;    It's a whole new money game
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The haggling is over. Now, let the haggling begin.
</P>
<P>
   While the NBA's board of governors was approving the league's
new labor agreement, Dikembe Mutombo was laughing Thursday at the
Sheraton Hotel in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a mad rush to sign guys,'' Mutombo said.
``Actually, I think it's already started.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be illegal of course, but...
</P>
<P>
   Hawks president Stan Kasten understands the reality as 29 teams
toe the starting line, waiting for the gun to sound and the
free-agent season to open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (the owners and general managers present) that we would
abide by the rules, and I expected them to do the same,'' Kasten
said, his tone arch.
</P>
<P>
   Right. And all waiters keep accurate tax records of their tip
money.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of that, the NBA caved in late Friday afternoon and said
agents and teams can start talking but cannot make deals.
</P>
<P>
   Player signings could start as early as Jan. 18, and such teams
as the Hawks, Bulls and Suns can't wait very long. Each has only
four players under contract, and, if the Suns have their toes over
the line, well, with $18 million to spend, only a competitor could
blame them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Chicago's stakes are higher. Those on the free-agent
sidelines include Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Odds are that
neither will be around this season, but the longer they wait to
announce intentions the more difficult it's going to be for the
Bulls to assemble a competitive team. In fact, the once ludicrous
notion that the Bulls might have to renounce Jordan, who made $33
million last season, could become a frightening public-relations
reality.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks will have six players when their rookies sign in,
seven when Tyrone Corbin agrees to a $1 million deal that is
virtually done. But re-signing Alan Henderson is no lock. Neither
are there any guarantees that Antonio McDyess will re-up with the
Suns.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the money games within the games are very much
alive, even though players now are slotted at different levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think agents are no longer useful,'' Kasten said,
``but that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   No, not at all. They will survive as a breed, agent Keith Glass
said: ``We're like rats; we adapt.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson is a good example of how contentious the process might
be. As a three-year player, he can make as much as $9 million this
season with 12 percent raises on the base year thereafter. But as
promising as Henderson might be, he has only been a starter for
about half a season, and he has averaged slightly fewer than 22
minutes a game in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson might prefer to remain with his teammates, but he
could be able to find a team desperate to sign a forward with
promise, hang the cost. That's the sort of thinking that got the
owners in trouble in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The pro game constantly evolves on the court, and now the
changes will come in the way contracts are constructed. For
example, if the Hawks were willing, Henderson could sign a
seven-year contract that would start at $9 million and ultimately
be worth $87 million. The same starting point would get him to
$67.5 million with another team. That's because the Hawks can give
a ``Bird rights'' player, their own free agent, an annual raise at
12 percent, while another team could pay only 10 percent. In the
fifth year of a contract, a player can choose to get out and
negotiate again.
</P>
<P>
   But a player in Henderson's spot might ask for a four-year deal,
so he could move up to the middle level in terms of playing
experience, which allows for an $11 million top. He could then take
a three-year deal and shoot for the top level with a $14 million
salary.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't expected to happen with Henderson, but it could with
such players as Kobe Bryant, Allan Iverson and Stephon Marbury, at
some point.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the rush to sign becomes such a dicey game.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte Hornets are under pressure to give star scoring
forward Glen Rice a new deal, but if they do, they might not be
able to afford either of their free-agent centers, Vlade Divac or
Matt Geiger.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Rockets want to add a big name, such as Pippen or
McDyess, but they also want to keep young players Matt Maloney and
Othella Harrington. Given that teams are penalized heavily for
having unsigned free agents on their cap list _ it's 300 percent
for players under the league average and 250 percent for players
over the average (Jordan counts $82.5 million against the Bulls'
cap) _ the Rockets have unenviable choices if they are to utilize
fully their $9 million for a star.
</P>
<P>
   No team has more to spend than the Suns with $18 million. That
gives them the best shot at such players as Tom Gugliotta. However,
Denver is heavily courting agent Richard Howell's client and using
an unorthodox tactic to overcome a terrible history _ 11-71 last
season _ and a coach, Mike D'Antonio, who is so obscure that his
name does not appear in the NBA Register's coaches' section.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's advantage is Gugliotta's wife, a tri-athlete who loves
Colorado. But after being trapped on bad teams earlier in his
career, the multi-purpose power forward might elect to remain in
Minnesota, where he can get his best deal and be part of a
burgeoning contender. If not, the Suns, with their magnificent
arena and weather and their commitment to do almost anything to
win, are a powerful lure.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the Lakers to be active. They already have dumped Nick
Van Exel after last spring's embarrassing four-game collapse
against Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other Western contenders Seattle, Utah and Seattle
will do more tweaking than shaking up. The same is true for
Indiana, Miami and New York in the East. All have either big
rosters or salary-cap problems.
</P>
<P>
   The woeful Canadian teams, Toronto and Vancouver, and the Los
Angeles Clippers have 10 guaranteed contracts each on their 12-man
rosters.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes stability is an unenviable condition.

 &HT;    Chrebet, the littlest Jet, plays big on third down
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Never known as a braggart, the smallest
player on the field for today's divisional-round game between the
New York Jets and Jacksonville Jaguars was confident enough last
week to suggest he might actually make the biggest impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games like this a lot of times come down to who makes the most
plays on third down,'' New York wide receiver Wayne Chrebet said.
``And I think that's where I give us an edge. That's when I want
the ball the most. I feel like third down is my down.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly has been the case during Chrebet's four seasons
in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Of his 283 receptions, 113 have converted third downs into first
downs. Chrebet had 26 third-down catches in 1998, the sixth-most in
the league, and 412 of his career-best 1,083 yards came on third
down. Four of his career-high eight touchdown receptions were on
third-down plays. Chrebet tied with teammate Keyshawn Johnson for
the most first downs produced (60) by reception.
</P>
<P>
   Among the wide receivers who entered the league in '95, only
Arizona's Frank Sanders has more catches than Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   Those are heady numbers for the former Hofstra University
walk-on, an undersized guy (5 feet 10, 185 pounds) who originally
signed with the Jets as an undrafted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Just Give Me The Damn Ball,'' Johnson derisively
refers to Chrebet as a ``team mascot'' and the two barely speak.
But even the loquacious Johnson has been forced to grudgingly
concede that his colleague is a rare talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give the guy his due, he gets the job done,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he starts with Johnson in the Jets' two-wideout base
set, Chrebet moves inside on third down when Dedric Ward becomes
the third receiver. In a survey of nine AFC personnel directors
last week, Chrebet was named by six as the premier slot receiver in
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Working primarily between the hash marks, his technical
proficiency in route-running and fearlessness in going after the
ball are huge assets. And despite relatively pedestrian speed,
Chrebet possesses good run-and-catch abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can try to 'bracket' him with a linebacker, but most times
Chrebet is going to be working against man-to-man,'' Buffalo
secondary coach Bill Bradley said. ``And he has the smarts to beat
one guy in most situations.''
</P>
<P>
   In what might be a high-scoring shootout between the Jets and
Jaguars, the battle of Chrebet and Jacksonville ``nickel'' safety
Mike Logan could be the critical matchup of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacksonville secondary is suspect; the pass rush rates the
worst among clubs still in the playoffs, and Logan is more a zone
than a man-to-man defender. If the Jaguars play mostly zone
coverages, Chrebet will find some cozy creases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the caliber of receiver on both teams, there could
be some big plays made in the passing game,'' Chrebet said. ``I'm
not a big-play guy in terms of those 60-yard catches, but if we
need to keep the ball moving, I feel like I'm the guy who can do it
for us.''

 &HT;    Viking stars overshadow very fine line
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Long before he started scrutinizing videotape of the
Minnesota Vikings' skill-position players last week, Dave McGinnis
was popping aspirin like it was candy. The powerful Minnesota
offensive line that left lumps on the heads of foes during the 1998
season had become a throbbing migraine for McGinnis, the Arizona
Cardinals' defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-scoring offense in NFL history may conclude most
possessions with Randy Moss or Cris Carter standing in the end zone
after a long pass from Randall Cunningham or tailback Robert Smith
getting there on a long run.
</P>
<P>
   Like most coaches, however, McGinnis realizes all the action
starts with the NFL's premier blocking unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of all those flashy guys they have on offense, people
lose sight of the fact the offensive line is so good,'' said
McGinnis, whose defensive front seven needs another stellar
performance today to stay with the Vikings. ``You've got three of
the five (linemen) going to the Pro Bowl, and the two who aren't
could make a pretty good case. It really is one of the most
talented units I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, few lines of the past two decades can match up with left
tackle Todd Steussie, left guard Randall McDaniel, center Jeff
Christy, right guard David Dixon and right tackle Korey Stringer.
Top backup Everett Lindsay, a versatile player who has lined up at
all five positions this season and started three games, is good
enough to start for several teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel, Steussie and Christy were voted to the NFC Pro Bowl
team this season. Stringer might be the best right-side power
tackle in the game, and Minnesota line coach Mike Tice thinks Dixon
is the most improved player on the team. Twice this season Dixon
manhandled Tampa Bay defensive tackle Warren Sapp.
</P>
<P>
   Even with lightweights Christy (6-3, 281) and McDaniel (6-3,
279), the unit ranks as the NFL's biggest, averaging 6 feet 4 1/4,
318.2 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only the size, though, that will present major problems
today for the Cardinals' undersized front. The Vikings linemen are
superb technicians, well-schooled by Tice. And it doesn't hurt to
have a 10-time Pro Bowl performer like McDaniel, still one of the
league's quickest guards at age 34, around to lead by example.
</P>
<P>
   Management has been savvy enough to recently re-sign Steussie
and Stringer to new, long-term contracts. With the exception of
Christy, who soon could get an extension, all the linemen are under
contract until at least the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing free agency has affected the most, in a negative
sense, is the offensive line play,'' Steussie said. ``They've
demonstrated foresight here in trying to keep this group together,
and that's paid off for them.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis, who played five down linemen last week against Dallas
and often dropped undersized ends Simeon Rice and Andre Wadsworth
into the flats, figures to have some gimmick schemes for today as
well. But even he isn't confident that brains can overcome the
Vikings' brawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to fight them and hard to finesse them,'' he said.
``They make it a long day.''

   GLF-PGA _ It's the beginning of a new year on the PGA Tour.
Although it isn't unusual for there to be more money available than
ever before, this year there's LOTS more money. Why? Because of the
new World Golf Championships, three megabucks events added to the
schedule this year, and new TV contracts that have poured much more
money into the sport. (Dolch, Palm Beach Post). 21. MOVED

FIRE COMMISSIONER WANTS INSTRUCTIONS IN EVERY APARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Because of widespread ignorance about what to do in a
fire, safety instructions should be posted on the door in every
apartment in New York City, just as they are in hotel rooms, Fire
Commissioner Thomas Von Essen said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Von Essen said he planned to have fire officials meet with
landlord groups and the City Council to create a voluntary program.
But if that fails, he said he was prepared to ask the council to
require such notices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple thing, but it makes all the sense in the
world,'' Von Essen said in an interview Saturday at City Hall.
``Landlords should educate their own tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   His proposal is part of the Giuliani administration's response
to last month's fire at Park South Tower on West 60th Street in
Manhattan, where four residents died in a smoke-filled stairwell.
</P>
<P>
   Tenant leaders there blamed the deaths on a variety of factors,
including broken intercoms, the busy phone at the desk in the
lobby, lack of alarms, poorly marked exits and basic
misunderstanding about what to do in a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents, dutifully following instructions posted at the
elevators to use the stairs in case of fire, tried to escape via
the stairwells. But the smoke and fumes in one of them proved
deadly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, safety experts said, people in high-rise buildings
should not use either the elevators or stairwell during a fire.
They should leave their apartments only if that is where the fire
is. Otherwise, they should stay where they are until firefighters
arrive. That is because high-rise construction is fire resistant,
and will almost always confine a fire to the apartment where it
started.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the many different types of buildings in the city,
some of which are not fireproof, Von Essen said the posted
instructions should be tailored to each location. Those
instructions could advise tenants whether a specific building is
safe to stay in if there is a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the city administration's plan to enhance fire
safety were announced Thursday and Friday by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
and Von Essen.
</P>
<P>
   Those proposals include a requirement for sprinklers in
apartments and hallways of all new residential buildings, including
single-family homes; the installation of public-address systems,
which could be used to alert and direct residents in emergencies,
in all apartment buildings over six floors high; and a citywide
safety-education campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The council appears willing to adopt those programs. But at a
council hearing on Friday, tenant leaders, safety experts and
representatives of the sprinkler industry said the mayor's program
did not go far enough. The critics demanded that sprinklers be
required in existing high-rise buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate industry has opposed sprinklers as unnecessary
and expensive, estimating the cost at thousands of dollars for each
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said Saturday that putting sprinklers in existing
buildings was a complex issue that needed more study. ``We haven't
closed our minds to that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although most other major cities require sprinklers in high-rise
apartments, New York _ with far more people living in high-rises
than other cities have _ does not. The city has instead relied on
codes mandating fire-resistant construction.

CRIME CREEPS INTO A NEW JERSEY SUBURB 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLEMINGTON, N.J. _ Amid the sprawling fields, winding roads,
run-down farms and 19th-century stone houses that typify much of
Hunterdon County, there is an increasing intrusion more alarming
than the deer or bears that wander into people's back yards: crime.
</P>
<P>
   While the crime rate is down sharply in most parts of New
Jersey, it is rising in Hunterdon County _ and faster than anywhere
else in the state, according to statistics released the week before
last for the first half of 1998. The statistics, compiled by state
police, showed Hunterdon with a 32 percent increase, almost
entirely because of nonviolent crimes like burglary and car theft.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hunterdon County, about an hour due west of New York
City, has suddenly become a dangerous place. In the first six
months of 1998, it reported the fewest violent crimes of any county
in the state, and not a single murder. Over all, Hunterdon had 903
reported crimes in that period. Only Sussex County had fewer, with
857.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Flemington, the county seat, and in Trenton,
the state capital, acknowledge that crime is not as rare as it used
to be. They blame Hunterdon's swift population growth, describing
the rise in shoplifting, car thefts and house break-ins as a
natural consequence of a rural farming region being transformed
into suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are moving into that county at a very rapid pace,''
said John Hagerty, a state police spokesman. ``This is not an
unusual phenomenon. When you have a wealthier urban population
moving into rural areas, you usually see an increase in
property-related crime, a spike. It then levels off and ultimately
decreases as law enforcement responds.''
</P>
<P>
   The population in Hunterdon County has jumped nearly 14 percent
since 1990, to 122,842 in 1998, according to an estimate by the
county planning board, from 107,802, according to federal census
data. Accompanying the population growth of about 2 percent a year
has been a boom in new housing, strip malls and other stores and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Front-page articles in last week's Hunterdon County Democrat, a
newspaper published on Thursdays, convey the sense of growth: In
Lambertville there are plans to build a new police station. In
Ringoes the county wants to triple the size of a public-library
branch, and the Postal Service is trying to find a bigger post
office.
</P>
<P>
   In many towns, the growth means more work for the local police
or the state police, which patrols small towns that do not have
their own departments.
</P>
<P>
   In Franklin Township, the opening of a Wal-Mart store in 1997
was followed by some new restaurants. Now Hampton Inn is building a
motel, and there are plans for a multiplex movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting a little more congested up here,'' said the
police chief, Edward Mangini, explaining why his department hired
two more officers and now stays open 24 hours a day instead of 20.
</P>
<P>
   In Franklin, as throughout Hunterdon County, much of the rise in
crime seems to be vehicle-related. ``We have a significant increase
in DWI cases and minor drug cases,'' Mangini said. ``There's been
some burglary and theft, mostly motor-vehicle-related things.''
</P>
<P>
   Each week, the crime blotter in The Hunterdon County Democrat
describes an array of incidents that support Mangini's description
of crime in the county, like the recent arrests of a 42-year-old
Ringoes man who was charged with drunken driving and a 22-year-old
Plainfield man who was charged with possessing marijuana after
being stopped for speeding on Route 202.
</P>
<P>
   That highway, which leads from Somerville to the Pennsylvania
border, and Interstate 78, which connects Jersey City with
Allentown, Pa., are the two main roadways through Hunterdon, where
officers often discover crimes committed by drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But the majority of incidents are minor, country-town stuff,
like the driver who ran off Rosemont-Ringoes Road and knocked over
Lori Hudzik's mailbox in Delaware Township. Or the driver who
struck a deer on Route 31. Hunterdon County remains a place that
people move to so they can enjoy the fresh air and where a state
trooper, stopping to check up on your sick neighbor, might come
over and help you feed the chickens.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Raritan Township last month, Officer Ed Barnes was dispatched
to deal with a group of rowdy teen-agers who had gathered after 11
p.m. for a milk-drinking contest. According to an article in The
County Democrat, under the headline ``Bored Teens Do Dairy,'' 15
upperclassmen from Hunterdon Central High School each bought a
gallon jug of milk and put up $10 stakes, to be taken by the winner
who could drink the most and hold it down.
</P>
<P>
   No one was arrested when Barnes broke up the Friday night event,
although he declined to turn on his lights and sirens to make the
scene more exciting for a youngster among the crowd of 15 who was
videotaping the event. As Barnes ordered everyone to break it up
and head home, several contestants were said to have been in the
bushes suffering the unhappy consequences of milk-chugging defeat.
</P>
<P>
   State Trooper William Wheatley, who is assigned to the nearby
towns of Stockton and Kingwood as part of the state community
policing program, said law enforcers in Hunterdon County spend most
of their time working to prevent problems rather than responding to
actual crimes, which are still rare.
</P>
<P>
   Making his rounds last week, Wheatley stopped to check on an
elderly Kingwood resident who had been sick, only to find that the
man was still in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Wheatley spent a few minutes chatting with the man's
neighbor, Julius Gombosi, a farmer who has lived in Hunterdon all
his life. Gombosi said he hadn't much noticed the increase in
crime, though he was robbed once, about three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Phillips, 49, whose family has owned a wine store in
Stockton for 53 years, said the growth inevitably meant more crime.
``I think it's the influx of population,'' he said. ``There's a lot
of new people moving in.'' But he said he still felt as safe as
always.
</P>
<P>
   County officials stressed that the statistics showing increased
crime did not also reflect the amount of growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go from very, very little to a little,'' said the
county's principal planner, Les Varga, ``it seems like a lot.''

WITH $5,000 BONUSES AT STAKE, TWO TEAR UP A FAST TRACK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Ind., Ireland)   (jw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a sports world in which a baseball player can earn
$13 million a year and a basketball player has just been limited to
an annual ceiling of $14 million, $5,000 sounds like tip money. But
to track and field athletes, especially those below the superstar
level of a Michael Johnson or a Jackie Joyner-Kersee, $5,000 is a
good day's pay, especially this early in the indoor season when no
one is in the best racing shape.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was a $5,000 day for Richie Boulet, a 25-year-old
Californian, and Sinead Delahunty, a 27-year-old from Ireland. In
the New Balance Games at the Armory Track and Field Center in
Washington Heights, Boulet won the men's invitation mile in 3
minutes 57.89 seconds and Delahunty the women's mile in 4:31.96.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time elite athletes had competed on the
month-old, six-lane, 200-meter banked track, with a Mondo
artificial surface atop plywood. The track is fast, and the New
Balance, basically a high school meet with a handful of invitation
events, offered incentives for the runners to be fast, too.
</P>
<P>
   If the men's winner bettered four minutes, he was assured of a
$5,000 bonus. If the women's winner bettered 4:33, she would get
$5,000. If one broke the barrier but not the other, the barrier
breaker would get $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The men raced first. Boulet was tired because he flew here from
California on Friday and bad weather kept him from reaching his
hotel room here until 12:30 Saturday morning. But the race pace was
easy and consistent, and Boulet finished strongly, winning by 8
meters. As fast as his race was, he had run faster _ 3:53.26
outdoors and 3:56.85 indoors.
</P>
<P>
   James Njoroge, a 25-year-old Kenyan, finished second in 3:58.78;
Matt Holthaus third in 3:59.43, Tom Nohilly fourth in 4:00.53 and
Karl Paranya fifth in 4:00.71. It was the first sub-four-minute
mile for Njoroge, a 1997 graduate of Taylor University in Indiana.
He had not run indoors for two years because of a stress fracture
in his right shin.
</P>
<P>
   This was Boulet's first race since early August, and he was not
so optimistic beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be tough going under four minutes this early in the
season,'' he said before the race. ``This is a form check. If I
don't break four minutes, I go home and train. If I break it, I
still go home and train.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunty, who lives in Boston, took over her race Saturday with
two laps remaining, ran the last quarter-mile in 64.1 seconds and
beat Debbie Marshall (4:33.57) by 10 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done very little speed work,'' Delahunty said, ``and I
had no idea what the splits were. I went by how I felt, and I felt
good.''
</P>
<P>
   While Delahunty was racing, Boulet watched from a high-jump pit
near the finish line. Until the end, he could not tell if she would
break 4:33 and thus leave him with $5,000 instead of $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   He yelled at her to step it up, and when she did and cut into
his take-home pay, he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great for her and great for all of us,'' he said.

COURT REJECTS PROFESSOR'S CHALLENGE OF SEX-HARASSMENT FINDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. _ A state appeals court has again rejected a
Cornell psychology professor's $1.5 million lawsuit challenging the
school's procedures in finding him guilty of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, James Maas, 60, has long been one of Cornell's
most popular professors. Nearly 2,000 students attend his
introductory psychology class every fall, making it one of the
largest college courses in the country, and he is also nationally
known for his research on sleep deprivation and the educational
films and television specials he has produced.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling on Thursday came more than four years after Cornell
administrators upheld a unanimous finding by a faculty ethics
committee that Maas had behaved unprofessionally in his
relationship with four female students, and that his behavior
constituted sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The students worked for the professor as teaching assistants,
members of his film crew and, in one case, a nanny for his
children. Three of the women told the ethics committee that Maas
had repeatedly kissed and hugged them and made sexually suggestive
comments. All four said he had bought them gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Maas acknowledged much of the activity that led the committee in
Cornell's College of Arts and Sciences to find him guilty of sexual
harassment. But he sued Cornell in 1995, asserting that his
behavior did not constitute sexual harassment and that the
procedures used to review the accusations against him were invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell has since instituted campuswide procedures for
investigating and adjudicating accusations of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Maas was on a national book tour and did not return messages
left Friday evening at his home and office. One of his lawyers,
Michael Rothman, said he had not yet seen the decision, but said
the professor would likely appeal certain issues to the state Court
of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, the Appellate Division of the state
Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of six of Maas' eight original
claims against Cornell. The unanimous ruling last week by a
three-judge panel of the same court said a state Supreme Court
judge had properly dismissed the remaining two claims alleging that
Cornell had been negligent in failing to follow its own policies
and procedures in resolving the complaints against the professor.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MAKOBOLA, Congo _ There is no doubt that something awful
happened here. Dozens of mud huts are burnt to the ground; in one
the horns of a charred goat poke through the ashes. Most people
have fled. Fresh dirt is piled over at least four bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The question _ and it may be impossible to answer now _ is
whether there are more graves here, perhaps hundreds more. A Roman
Catholic news agency reported last week that at least 500 people,
many of them women, children and the elderly, were massacred by
rebel troops the week before last in their 5-month-old war to
overthrow President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels strongly deny the charge, and on Saturday they
escorted a group of journalists, along with their own
investigators, to this town of about 5,000 people in South Kivu
province, eight days after the last of the killings reportedly took
place. Soldiers closely tailed the reporters. Villagers were
reluctant to talk.
</P>
<P>
   But standing beside one grave, a man said his grandmother,
Nakashindi, was burnt alive in her house by rebel soldiers. Another
man, even as he stood next to a rebel commander, said soldiers had
torn through the town, shooting and burning huts, including his
own. Perhaps as many as 100 dwellings appeared to have been razed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was burned,'' he said. ``Even my clothes were
burned.''
</P>
<P>
   He said 15 civilians had been killed in his little cluster of
huts alone _ a number that exceeds the rebels' contention that only
10 civilians died in the entire town, people they claim were caught
in crossfire in two battles. In all, the man said, 600 people died
in Makobola.
</P>
<P>
   The commander, Charles Muchu, scoffed. ``Did you notice that
they never say 200 died or 250?'' he said. ``They all say 600.
That's the same number that the church gives. They all heard it on
the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the moral high ground is exceedingly important to the
rebels, and they are eager to refute the allegations of a massacre.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Ernest Likongo, the rebel commander in charge of
the region, gave his account of what happened. Early on Dec. 30, he
said, a band of attackers ambushed a small army post in Makobola,
10 miles south of the eastern city of Uvira, on Lake Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
   He identified the attackers as militiamen from the Hutu ethnic
group from neighboring Burundi and Mayi-Mayi warriors, a loose
federation of particularly fierce fighters in the Kivu area. Both
groups are reportedly aligned with Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   A battle broke out after rebel reinforcements arrived, he said,
and two days later the town was again attacked. A third ambush
followed on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   In all, he said, three rebel soldiers were killed, along with 10
of the ambushers and 10 civilians caught in crossfire, including
two mothers and their two babies. Both he and other rebel officials
said it was possible that more civilians were killed, but he
claimed that none were killed systematically and that the numbers
were wildly inflated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five hundred is too many,'' Likongo said. ``That's a whole
village.''
</P>
<P>
   The account differed starkly from that given by the Missionary
Service News Agency, which cited witnesses in reporting that it was
the rebels who had carried out three days of killings, starting
Jan. 30. They also claimed that soldiers from Rwanda, which along
with Uganda is backing the rebellion, carried out the attacks, a
charge that Rwandan officials deny.
</P>
<P>
   As several foreign governments, including Congo's former
colonizer, Belgium, called for an outside investigation, the
International Committee of the Red Cross in Nairobi said six of
their volunteers had been killed in the village.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the conflict have been accused of carrying out
mass killings, and Kabila had been accused of similar atrocities
when he came to power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate it takes a Makobola to make the outside world
remember that there are daily tragedies, human suffering and the
killing of innocent civilians, going on not only in the Kivu but
the whole Democratic Republic of the Congo,'' said Nina Galbe, the
Red Cross spokeswoman in Nairobi, who called on all parties in the
conflict to spare civilians' lives.
</P>
<P>
   In two closely supervised hours roaming around Makobola,
reporters saw no mass graves, though several villagers said there
was one several miles away. Bullet casings littered the road.
Almost everyone agreed that there had been an attack on the army
outpost, and several people said the attackers had also looted
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took my bike,'' said Bahati Shabani, a 20-year-old
English teacher who has three sons. ``They even took many of my
clothes, and my wife's.''
</P>

FALCONS TOP 49ERS, GAIN NFC FINAL 
</HEADLINE>

   ATLANTA _ A spin, a twist. A spin and twist of players. A spin
and twist of fate.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-Atlanta playoff clash Saturday afternoon at
the Georgia Dome turned immediately on spins and twists by the
teams' marquee running backs. Those moves set the tone, changed the
complexion, put the 49ers immediately on the defensive and gave the
Falcons' confidence to rise against their longtime divisional
nemesis. And the Falcons did, finishing their hard work, beating
the 49ers by 20-18 before 70,262 fanatic fans.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (15-2) advances to the National Football Conference
championship game next Sunday against Minnesota or Arizona. The
Falcons are one victory away from Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   A spin. A twist.
</P>
<P>
   First, it was Garrison Hearst. On the game's first play from
scrimmage, the 49ers running back squirted through the line for 7
yards and then tried to plant his feet and spin, and twist, and
gain extra yardage. His left foot remained behind. Hearst was
carted away having suffered a broken fibula. How would the 49ers
come back from that? They certainly tried. They nearly did.
</P>
<P>
   Next, it was Jamal Anderson. He took a handoff with the ball at
the San Francisco 2, only three possessions after Hearst's injury.
And then Anderson tried nearly an identical move. A spin, a twist.
But for Anderson, a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Atlanta led, 7-0, with 6 minutes 25 seconds left in the
first quarter. The Falcons would build a 14-0 lead and then see the
fight that remained in the 49ers. It was not enough, though, as
Atlanta moved on. San Francisco finished its season with a 13-5
record.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta led by 14-10 at halftime and then built that lead to
20-10 in the second half with the help of two interceptions thrown
by Steve Young. The first one, by safety Eugene Robinson, was
returned 77 yards to the 49ers' 20. That set up a 29-yard field
goal by Morten Anderson late in the third quarter. The second one,
by safety William White early in the fourth quarter, gave Anderson
a chance to convert on a 32-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   Young sought redemption. Tried creating his own spin on the
game. His own twist of fate.
</P>
<P>
   He drove the 49ers 87 yards in 13 plays, taking 7 minutes 36
seconds, and then finished it with his 8-yard touchdown run. The
kick holder, the backup quarterback Ty Detmer, took a high snap and
tossed a 2-point conversion pass to tight end Greg Clark and it was
a 20-18 game with 2:57 left.
</P>
<P>
   Young and the 49ers gained one more slim chance. A drive that
began at their own 4 with 38 seconds left. It ended in a
desperation pass that the Falcons swiped. Opportunistic. Tough.
Physical. The Falcons were all of that in their first home playoff
game in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of happy people in that locker room who deserve
this,'' said Atlanta Coach Dan Reeves. ``We fought to the very
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta used the initial 28 minutes 15 seconds of the first half
to build their 14-0 lead. But San Francisco scored 10 points in the
final 1:10, in an eyelash nearly matching the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   There were big plays and beautiful plays, more than bungled
plays, in the first half. The game-swinging moment of the half
occurred during San Francisco's initial scoring drive. Down by 14-0
with 3:06 left in the half, immediately following Anderson's
spectacular 34-yard touchdown run, San Francisco began a drive at
its 20 that quickly moved to the Atlanta 47.
</P>
<P>
   On first and 10, San Francisco tried a lateral from Young to
running back Terry Kirby. Kirby dropped it; Falcons end Chuck Smith
dove for it along with Kirby, the ball popped loose from Kirby and
Falcons linebacker Henri Crockett had apparently scooped it up and
scored on the return. But no.
</P>
<P>
   First the officials ruled that Atlanta had recovered at the spot
where Kirby dropped the ball, and the ball was dead there because
of contact. The officials quickly reversed that, saying that they
simply misspoke and that what they really meant was that Kirby had
recovered for San Francisco, and that when Kirby was touched by
Smith while both were on the ground, the ball was dead, right
there, by contact.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Jerry Markbreit said in a statement: ``The play was a
backward pass. It was recovered on the ground by San Francisco No.
41 Kirby and he was touched on the ground when he had possession.
The rule is down by contact.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a huge decision. Because San Francisco kept a good thing
going, with Young tossing a 34-yard strike to the backup running
back Chuck Levy that put the ball at the Atlanta 26. Then Jerry
Rice put his elusive touch to work, becoming the leader in
consecutive playoff games (23) with a reception. Rice vs.
cornerback Ray Buchanan figured to be one of the key matchups of
the game, and Rice won the battle on this play, a 17-yard scoring
catch with 1:10 left in the half. Rice faked inside, taking a hard
step, and Buchanan bit, bolting inside. Rice floated back outside
and Young tossed a line drive into Rice's hands and chest in the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   With 38 seconds left, San Francisco gained another scoring
chance. It was via an Atlanta turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler's pass was tipped at the line by defensive end
Charles Haley and it fell into Junior Bryant's waiting arms. It was
San Francisco's ball at the Atlanta 36. Young to J.J. Stokes for 16
yards, and a Young scramble for 7 yards, set up a 36-yard Wade
Richey field goal as time expired in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's work had gone for naught. It had held San Francisco
without a first down in the first quarter. It held the 49ers to 9
plays for 22 yards in the quarter, and to 1 rushing yard.
Meanwhile, the Atlanta rushing game clicked. And so did the
Falcons' special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Dwight, the Atlanta rookie kick returner from Iowa, grabbed
a punt and returned it 36 yards, to the San Francisco 38 with 9:32
left in the first quarter. That play set up the game's first score,
the 2-yard run by Anderson. In between Dwight's return and
Anderson's score, the Falcons converted a third-and-8 pass from the
49ers' 22 to the 49ers' 3. It was a tricky play, a formation with
three receivers bunched near the right tight end spot, one running
an out, one running an intermediate route and one running deep.
Mathis ran the intermediate route and was wide open for the 19-yard
grab.
</P>
<P>
   There was 3:12 left in the second quarter when Anderson scored
on his 34-yarder, the longest scoring run in Falcons playoff
history. It was a strong run in which Anderson broke through the
line on a quick trap play and then stiff-armed and dove his way
into the end zone. Through the first half alone, Anderson rushed
for 83 yards, a Falcons playoff record for total rushing yards in a
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, the Falcons led in total yards (221 to 147), in
rushing yards (101 to 9) and in first downs (11 to 6). But much of
their hard work vanished in the in final seconds of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Falcons, they understood there was more work
to do.

   LATAM-BANANAS _ MIAMI _ A taste of the tropics, nearly everyone
loves potassium-rich bananas. But this delicate fruit has split the
United States and Europe in a nasty trans-Atlantic tug-of-war that
could soon spell trouble for American consumers. This week, the
Clinton administration is expected to announce that it will go
ahead with plans to slap 100 percent tariffs on $590 million worth
of European goods as soon as Feb. 1. The move is designed to force
the European Union _ which gives preferences to banana growers in
former colonies, particularly those in the Caribbean _ to open its
markets to bananas produced in Latin America by U.S. companies. For
U.S. consumers, the retaliatory measure could double prices on
everything from cheese to linens to candles to cashmere sweaters.
But even more is at stake than higher prices. Experts fear that one
retaliation could spark another, igniting a real trade war between
the United States and the European Union that could threaten
two-way trade estimated at more than $400 billion a year. (Emling,
Cox News Service).

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Shulman's blue eyes glistened as he showed off
his most topical prize: an unused ticket to the impeachment trial
of President Andrew Johnson dated April 21, 1868.
</P>
<P>
   He picked it up at an auction in 1960 for $13 and thinks it
might be one of the few unused tickets remaining. He thinks it
might now be worth a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   But after suffering a heart attack five years ago, Shulman, 86,
gave it away to the place he loves the most, the New York Public
Library. He gave away almost everything else he valued to the same
institution _ a spelling primer from Colonial America, 20,000 old
postcards, and Bowery Boys novels the library did not have.
Thousands upon thousands of things.
</P>
<P>
   Years before, he gave the library his cryptography collection,
which included a book about secret writing published in 1518 and
comic books from World War II.
</P>
<P>
   These are only possessions. What Shulman, who wears blue jeans
and sneakers, lives for is the mental adventure the library
represents. It was there he ferreted out the earliest use of more
than 5,000 words and phrases for the Oxford English Dictionary,
which paid him when they printed the additions or modifications.
</P>
<P>
   It was also at the library that he built a plausible case that
baseball's first game was played in Manhattan, not in New Jersey _
and certainly not in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   He is a member of one of the city's most inclusive and
distinguished clubs: regular readers in the Brooke Russell Astor
Reading Room for Rare Books and Manuscripts, at the library's main
branch on Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street. The price of admission is
filling out an application attesting to a serious purpose. Users
range from people designing coffee-table books to poets seeking
inspiration in fraying Latin tomes.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Bartow, curator of rare books, says Shulman is both an
important contributor of material and one of the library's most
frequent users. ``David is what we're all about,'' she said. ``He
collects books, he researches endlessly and he writes for
publication.''
</P>
<P>
   His current campaign is to revive the reputation of Steve
Brodie, the man who declared he was the first to jump from the
Brooklyn Bridge and live. The New York Times, in its 1901 obituary,
told of how Brodie, ``on the strength of this imaginary feat,''
went on to become a saloon owner on the Bowery and start an acting
career.
</P>
<P>
   But Shulman believes that Brodie's feat was not imaginary at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Shulman spread out scores of old newspaper
stories on a library table to make the case. He had arrived by
subway from the St. Nicholas Adult Care Center in Brooklyn, where
he now lives.
</P>
<P>
   His motivation is to nail down another phrase for the Oxford
dictionary. ``To do a Brodie'' has long meant to take a dive, a
phrase sometimes applied to the stock market. But Shulman insists
that if the man did not dive, the phrase must go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in running everything down to primary sources,'' he
said. ``In other words, if you pursue the truth as far as you can,
you'll find out many times that it ain't so.''
</P>
<P>
   Painstakingly, through The National Police Gazette, The Brooklyn
Eagle and other sources, he sifted evidence against the assertion
that Brodie, a newsboy, conned reporters into believing him. He
noted that witnesses, including a police officer, testified that
they saw Brodie leap in 1886. Shulman asked, ``If he was carrying a
dummy, wouldn't anybody have noticed it? A dummy's a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded: ``Everything is alleged. No concrete evidence. I
think he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until he retired in 1956, this self-described ``Sherlock Holmes
of rare books'' designed puzzles for newspapers. In World War II,
he deciphered Japanese codes. He was long one of the world's top
Scrabble players. He never married, saying he never had the time.
He said his only relatives are two nieces whom he has had no time
for since they tried to stop him from giving his treasures to the
library.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but your relatives can be predators,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The library is different. There he can show friends his
impeachment ticket, or have millions of potentially fascinating
intellectual treats delivered to him. He can time-travel in the
manner of his mentor, Norbert Pearlroth, the chief researcher for
``Ripley's Believe It or Not,'' who pored through hundreds of books
virtually at random in search of odd facts.
</P>
<P>
   But Shulman, who carries myriad scribblings on index cards in a
plastic bag, came to see his mentor as less than rigorous.
``Instead of believing it,'' he said, ``I believed it not.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he bubbled happily off on a kaleidoscope of things. Did you
know there is no difference between a split finger fastball and a
forkball? Or that the marquess of Queensberry did not personally
write the rules of boxing that are named after him?

 &HT;    Suicide pact complete as second teen dies from head wound
 &HT;    By Jack Warner and Peter Scott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARROLL COUNTY, Ga. _ Jeff Miller died of a head wound before
dawn Saturday, fulfilling the vow authorities said he and his
15-year-old girlfriend made to die together.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 17, died at Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta at 6:20
a.m., about 22 hours after he and Andrea Garrett were found in the
science hall bathroom at Central High School in Carrollton, both
with .22 caliber gunshot wounds to the head. Andrea died Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a suicide pact,'' Carroll County Sheriff Tony Reeves
said Friday. ``Each of them intended on dying today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We may never know what happened in that bathroom,'' Reeves
told about 200 students, parents and teachers who gathered to meet
with counselors at the school Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reeves would not assign any motive to the suicide,
fellow students said Andrea's parents felt Jeff was too old for her
and forbade her to see him any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea lived in a yellow frame house on rural Roy North Road
with her parents, Bill and Susan Garrett. Five cows grazed in a
pasture beside it Saturday and a green artificial wreath with white
ribbons adorned the gate on the white, wooden fence in front of the
house. The yard and driveway were full of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A bearded man answered the door and told a reporter that the
Garretts would not be making a public statement. A memorial service
will be held for Andrea at 2 p.m . Monday at the Chapel of Almon
Funeral Home in Carrollton. Funeral arrangements for Jeff were not
available, and his relatives did not return calls asking for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the community meeting at the high school Saturday, Principal
Scott Cowart, fighting back tears, said, ``We are facing a test of
healing that none of us hoped would be.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the deaths ``a nightmare that will forever be etched
into our memory.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cowart was finished, others walked to the microphone to
speak. Among them was Tony Mashburn, a parent, who said some of the
1,050 students at the school meet for Bible study on Wednesday
morning. He noted that Jeff and Andrea were not among that group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these kids had Christ,'' he said, their suicides might have
been averted.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Dunlap, a classmate at whose home Jeff had been staying,
took the microphone and said Mashburn ``has no right to say that
about Jeff and Andrea. He doesn't know half the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean's father, Craig Dunlap, told the group reports that Jeff
did not have any friends were untrue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My two boys were his best friends, and my little girl too. He
was my friend. Jeff Miller had friends,'' said Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   Another parent, Charles Landers, wanted to know how the handgun
_ taken from a gun safe in Andrea's house _ was brought into the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Cowart said he has launched an investigation to determine that,
but ``if somebody wanted to get one in here, they can,'' he said.
An effective metal detector program could cost as much as $1
million for a school the size of Central.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves told the audience that the rumor suggesting the death of
the two students may have been inspired by a murder-suicide
Thursday of an adult couple in Villa Rica was untrue. He said his
investigation showed the youngsters had death in mind before then.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves urged parents to know the warning signs of suicide and
talk to their children. Others urged students to report to adults
veiled threats of suicide such as Jeff had apparently made to some
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Staff writers Bill Montgomery and Clint Williams contributed to
this report.

 WASHINGTON: his lawyers.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the most difficult charges for the president to rebut
are contained in the article of impeachment charging him with lying
before the grand jury about the nature and details of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Lewinsky testified in detail
about 11 sexual encounters with the president. That testimony is
perhaps the most problematic evidence confronting the president's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Because Clinton told the grand jury that he did not have sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky as defined in the Jones case, the
evidence on this point boils down to his word against hers.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team must decide whether to try to
undermine Ms. Lewinsky's credibility with other evidence. Among
that evidence is the testimony of witnesses and friends of Ms.
Lewinsky's who said that Ms. Lewinsky told them things that may
have been untrue, like the Secret Service took the president to Ms.
Lewinsky's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the president's lawyers paint Ms. Lewinsky as a
liar, their ability to use her testimony to support other aspects
of their case, particularly on obstruction of justice, could be
hindered.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution team will try to broaden its perjury case by
charging that the president lied about other details, like when his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky began, the frequency of their
meetings and the number of times they had sexually explicit
telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team will emphasize that Clinton admitted
to an ``inappropriate, intimate'' relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
before the grand jury. They will argue that differences between the
president's and Ms. Lewinsky's descriptions of the number and
specific details of their sexual encounters are not significant
enough to support a perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the president has testified that he thought the
sexual activity in which he engaged with Ms. Lewinsky fell outside
the definition of sexual relations in the Jones case. However, this
argument has provoked criticisms that the president and his lawyers
are engaged in tortured legal hair-splitting.
</P>
<P>
   The perjury article of impeachment also charges the president
with lying when he told the grand jury that he did not lie in the
Jones case and with letting his lawyer in the Jones case, Robert S.
Bennett, falsely deny that the president and Ms. Lewinsky were
sexually involved. It also accuses the president of lying to his
aides about his dealings with Ms. Lewinsky. The charges involving
Bennett and the aides are repackaged in the second article of
impeachment involving obstruction of justice, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team thinks these allegations are more
easily rebutted. They will argue that he thought he was being
technically truthful, even if he was misleading, during the Jones
deposition. Hardly intending to lie to his aides in order to
influence their future testimony, the president's defenders will
explain, he was trying to conceal from his friends and family an
improper relationship about which he was deeply embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   The article of impeachment charging obstruction of justice turns
on the belief of both Starr and the House prosecutors that the
president wanted Ms. Lewinsky to testify falsely in the Jones case
and that he also sought to influence other potential witnesses,
like Ms. Currie, his aides and his lawyer, Bennett, to give false
accounts of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. In return for her
false testimony, Ms. Lewinsky was to be rewarded with help finding
a job.
</P>
<P>
   In the perjury case, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is at odds with
crucial aspects of the president's account. In the obstruction
case, the prosecutors must make a circumstantial but highly
suggestive set of facts support a sweeping accusation. None of the
witnesses involved in the events, including Ms. Lewinsky, Ms.
Currie and Jordan, has testified that the president asked them to
lie, schemed to hide evidence or tried to enlist help to keep Ms.
Lewinsky quiet.
</P>
<P>
   In both the Starr referral and the final House impeachment
report, great weight is given to gifts that the President gave Ms.
Lewinsky that she later turned over to Ms. Currie. The gifts were
subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee concluded that Ms. Currie would
not have retrieved the gifts unless asked to do so by the
president.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ms. Currie testified that Ms. Lewinsky asked her to
collect the gifts, and the president has denied asking Ms. Currie
to retrieve them.
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis of her testimony by the president's
lawyers, Ms. Lewinsky has given 10 different accounts of her
conversations with the president about the gifts. In none of those
conversations, they will argue, did the president instruct Ms.
Lewinsky to conceal the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Currie also testified that she felt no pressure or
intimidation from the president, who is accused of trying to
influence her testimony, and she was not a witness in any
proceeding when the president talked to her about Ms. Lewinsky.

HUSKIES' COMPETITION ABOUT TO GET TOUGHER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To provide his starters with tougher competition, Geno Auriemma,
the women's coach at the University of Connecticut, sent two
assistants in search of male practice players a few years ago. But
with 11 players capable of starting for most teams in the Big East,
Auriemma no longer needs to find men to practice against his front
liners.
</P>
<P>
   Several players on the top-ranked and undefeated UConn women's
team, which meets No. 2 Tennessee in a showdown at Gampel Pavilion
on Sunday afternoon, have said their toughest competition to date
has come from one another during practice sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Through its first 13 games, Connecticut has surpassed 100 points
nine times while beating its opponents by an average of 40 points.
``We do score pretty easily at times,'' Auriemma said after the
Huskies trounced Pittsburgh, 106-52, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They are unlikely to score so easily against Tennessee, which
has lost only once in 13 games _ to Purdue on Nov. 15 _ and has won
three consecutive national championships.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols have also won three of the last four games against
UConn, including a 15-point victory last January before 24,597
people in Knoxville. Tennessee also knocked off the Huskies in both
the 1996 Final Four and the 1997 Midwest Regionals.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tennessee has lost both times it has played in
Connecticut _ at the Storrs campus in 1995 and at Hartford in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to play down the significance of Sunday's game, Auriemma
said: ``I realize that for a lot of people the world will come to
an end around 7 o'clock Sunday night when we will either have won
the national championship or wrapped up second place. It's like the
season ends on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   It will not, of course, but the game could be a portent for this
season's Final Four. The outcome, no doubt, will instill confidence
in the victor and a certain doubt in the loser.
</P>
<P>
   UConn's depth could be decisive. Eight players are averaging at
least 17 minutes of play, including sophomore Shea Ralph, who has
averaged 22 minutes though she has not started a game since
returning from a knee injury that caused her to miss all of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Her playing time is second only to Amy Duran, the team captain
and lone senior on the starting five. Duran has played 23 minutes a
game. Reflecting the Huskies' balance, five players are averaging
in double figures _ Svetlana Abrosimova (17.5 points), Ralph
(16.7), and three freshmen, Tamika Williams (12.4), Swin Cash (12)
and Asjha Jones (10.2). Cash, who is coming back from a stress
fracture in her right foot that kept her out of two games and
limited her to only seven minutes in the most recent game, is
expected to see significant playing time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that if we don't play well, someone just as good is
right behind us,'' said Williams, who scored a career-high 21
points and pulled down 9 rebounds against Pittsburgh on Thursday
night and who is shooting at a 64 percent clip.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee counters Connecticut's depth with its three ``Meeks''
_ the incomparable senior Chamique Holdsclaw from Astoria, Queens,
and the sophomores Tamika Catchings and Semeka Randall. They each
were chosen as preseason all-Americans and they average 20, 15 and
13 points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its ``unique blend of experience and young players,'' as
Auriemma has described his team, Connecticut is not at full
strength coming into Sunday's game. Besides Cash, Sue Bird of
Syosset, N.Y., a member of what is acknowledged as the best
freshmen class in women's Division I basketball and who had been
the starting point guard, has been lost for the rest of the season
because of a knee injury. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ ``I'm just a small person,'' said Un
Samath, a customs inspector, using a common phrase among
Cambodians, ``so I dare not say.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he got angry, and he said it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate them,'' he said of the defecting Khmer Rouge leaders
who recently flaunted their impunity in a tourist trip around
Cambodia. ``So long as it doesn't cause a war, I want to see them
on trial. Cambodians cannot be happy as long as they are happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, like a man who has decided that the time has come to
speak, Un Samath, 46, described the pain he shares with almost
every other Cambodian of his generation _ the killings of family
members, the years of fear and hunger, the loss of youth and
education, the continuing harshness of life.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one of countless unburdenings that are taking place
among Cambodians today as the country seems to be embarking,
spontaneously, on a long-delayed national conversation about its
traumatic past.
</P>
<P>
   In Phnom Penh, the capital, and in Battambang, the country's
second-largest city, interviews with a score of people from market
vendors to professors suggest that a common legacy of anger and
pain is being shared in a new way.
</P>
<P>
   As Cambodia struggles to break with its feudal past, the
comments also suggest an emerging political assertiveness among
people better informed and more aware of their rights. Recently,
several political parties and labor unions have formed, and people
are coming forward to seek redress for land seizure or the dumping
of toxic waste _ evils that in the past they might simply have
accepted as their fate.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly near-unanimous view is that Khmer Rouge leaders
should be put on trial, if only to determine who is really to blame
for the country's suffering _ and even if any convictions are
followed by an amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   If this is so, it offers a response to those who fear that
international pressure for a trial amounts to a new burden imposed
on an already traumatized people. It is also a response to the
defectors' assertion that pressure for a trial comes from a foreign
intervention against the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   There has still been no real assessment of the national will.
Prime Minister Hun Sen has asserted that people do not want a
trial, while King Norodom Sihanouk has stated that they do.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1975 and 1979, more than a million Cambodians died from
malnutrition, overwork, untreated diseases or executions. After a
wave of anger and mourning in the early 1980s, Cambodia settled
into a state of stunned and sluggish denial, its psychic wounds
unacknowledged and festering.
</P>
<P>
   The surrender of the two Khmer Rouge leaders _ Khieu Samphan and
Nuon Chea _ and their welcome by the government have apparently,
without anyone having intended or foreseen it, aroused these buried
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, the defections have ignited the feelings of the
people,'' said Kao Kim Hourn, who heads a private office studying
regional policy, the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the major topic now that people talk about,'' he said.
``People from all walks of life have begun to question what
happened in that period. They share a common past, a common
suffering and therefore a common outrage when they see these mass
killers returning to the mainstream of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say that even as international pressure grows to put
Khmer Rouge leaders on trial for crimes against humanity, a dozen
of them are living freely now in Cambodia, following the collapse
of their guerrilla movement in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   If public pressure built, it could affect the fate of these
figures in a country where the voice of the ``small people'' has
not generally been heard by the ``big people'' in power.
</P>
<P>
   After Hun Sen welcomed the defectors two weeks ago, saying, ``We
should dig a hole and bury the past,'' he found it politically
necessary to issue what he called a clarification a few days later
and declare that he was all for justice.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has not yet said whether it will seek to
arrest the defectors, who are now in Pailin, a remote town near the
Thai border where they are protected by armed former guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is becoming difficult for the government to just dictate to
the people and ignore public opinion,'' Kao Kim Hourn said.
``People have reached a certain level of maturity. They have more
access to information, they don't have to be so much concerned
about food and security and another war.''
</P>
<P>
   With popular emotions stirring, he said, ``internal pressure on
the government has begun to build up.'' He added: ``National
reconciliation at all costs? Bury the past? Forgive and forget? No.
I don't think that is the case now.''
</P>
<P>
   If indeed a new, more politically demanding society is emerging,
it may be one positive legacy of the huge international effort at
democratization organized by the United Nations at the start of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violent power politics that has persistently stunted
the establishment of democracy and human rights, a fledgling civil
society has begun to emerge, addressing everything from education
to flood control. This society is led by some 200 local
nongovernmental agencies, most with foreign funding.
</P>
<P>
   The country's nascent discussion also offers a remembrance of
the dead as people recount their losses.
</P>
<P>
   When they talk about the past, Cambodians commonly offer lists
of family members who died at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. Two
decades have passed, and this may be the last chance the country
has to seek an accounting on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   King Sihanouk himself, in a statement Thursday, published a list
of victims that included 5 children, 14 grandchildren, 2 cousins, a
half-uncle and a son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kao Kim Hourn, 32, lost a younger brother and sister. He said he
still dreamed about them. When he was a college student in the
United States, he said, his roommate called him ``the wall beater''
because of his violent nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Chhour Sokheang, 44, a university instructor, lost his father,
an uncle, an aunt, a cousin and about 25 other family members.
``Everybody is talking about it now,'' he said, ``my friends, my
students _ many, many people. Everybody says that now the Khmer
Rouge leaders are very lucky. When they had their forces, they
fought and killed Cambodian people. But when they lost, they came
back and the government welcomed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lim Navy, 39, who sells construction material, says she lost an
uncle, two uncles-in-law and more cousins than she can count. ``If
we start thinking about what the Khmer Rouge did,'' she said, ``we
just want to chop them up like minced pork.''
</P>
<P>
   Life then was filled with miseries both big and small, she said,
some of which can only be recalled with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   She recited a ditty that people shared secretly in the Khmer
Rouge years: ``Democratic woman with fleas on her head, democratic
woman with ringworms on her body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We even had fleas in our eyebrows,'' Mrs. Lim Navy said.
</P>
<P>
   People's lingering traumas assert themselves in unpredictable
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Kao Kim Hourn said he could not overcome a fear of starvation.
``All Cambodians who have been through this experience share
this,'' he said. ``At a restaurant we order much more food than we
can finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lim Navy said she could not shake off a rumor that had
circulated among her friends at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to hear a truck at nighttime,'' she said, ``and people
said it was carrying bile from corpses to China. Ever since then I
haven't been able to drink wine from China. I'm afraid it's made
out of the bile of dead Cambodians.''

REEVES, FALCONS SHOW A LOT OF HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A show of hands, please. Last August, when trying to
handicap the NFC, how many figured Atlanta, Arizona and Minnesota
as the final three teams left standing in January?
</P>
<P>
   And thanks for being truthful.
</P>
<P>
   Long-shot players, rejoice. What once was, is no more in the
NFC. Dallas, San Francisco, Green Bay _ going, going, gone.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, consider the Atlanta Falcons, a franchise that had
spent its 33 years of existence serving mainly as an NFL poster
child for futility. The one place you'd never expect to find these
people is a conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, you will.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta coach Dan Reeves' surgically corrected heart passed a
serious sideline stress-test here yesterday. His football team
provided a multitude of EKG moments for Reeves, yet Atlanta
outlasted the 49ers, 20-18, in an interesting game of big plays,
big blunders, big controversy and one nasty big break, as in
Garrison Hearst's leg.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for Atlanta _ the winner of Minnesota and Arizona, which
means it's 99.9 percent certain the Falcons will be visiting just
south of the Arctic Circle next week. Then again, Reeves and Co.
have been full of surprises all season, starting with the 14-2
record that won the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have performed so well and so consistently all
season, beating the 49ers yesterday was not an upset. But it was a
very tough chore.
</P>
<P>
   All the medical attention was supposed to be focused on Reeves,
the 55-year-old head coach just four weeks removed from quadruple
heart bypass surgery. Reeves was back on the sidelines and back
wearing the coaching headset for the first time yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I wanted to keep the focus away from me,'' he said
after the game. And from a medical standpoint, the focus did
quickly shift. On the afternoon's first play from scrimmage,
Hearst, the reborn running back for the 49ers, popped through a
hole, had a nice gain, but was suddenly twirled around by an arm
tackle from Atlanta end Chuck Smith. Hearst's legs became twisted
as he hit the turf, and the left one bent back, breaking the
fibula.
</P>
<P>
   It is not far-fetched to say Hearst was the one key to the 49ers
winning here. In fact, Reeves, always an honest sort, said so
afterward. ``Going in, we thought the outcome would be decided by
the running games, and Jamal Anderson \R113 yards on 29 carries\S
provided that for us,'' he noted. ``But the difference in the
ballgame was the unfortunate injury to Garrison Hearst. That would
be like us losing Jamal.''
</P>
<P>
   It got worse for the 49ers when backup Terry Kirby was injured
five minutes later, left for the locker room, and when he did
return was far from 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci was gracious in defeat, but
did say, in an understatement, ``My running game took a couple of
hits.'' Actually, Mariucci had to throw out the game plan, tinted
heavily with the run, and rely totally on the arm of Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, that's all the 49ers had. Yesterday, it wasn't
enough, mainly because the usually reliable Young threw two very
costly interceptions in the second half. In both cases, it stopped
serious scoring threats.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons safety Eugene Robinson had a perfect deep ball read on
Young late in the third, swiped a pass on the 3-yard line, and
returned it 77 yards, setting up a field goal. The other safety,
William White, made a midfield, fourth-quarter interception of a
poorly thrown ball over the middle. That also set up a field goal.
Those two picks provided the only second-half points for Atlanta _
and decided the game.
</P>
<P>
   Young will be hearing in San Francisco this week what Troy
Aikman heard in Dallas last week _ plenty of harsh criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, it appeared Reeves' surgically repaired heart wouldn't
feel any stress. ``I thought we had the game under control, being
up, 21-0,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Hearst gone and Anderson rambling, Atlanta took a 14-zip
lead, and as Reeves pointed out, appeared to make it 21-0 just
before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Then came controversy, which started when Young threw a
behind-the-line-of-scrimmage backward pass to Kirby. The free ball
ended up on the ground. Kirby pounced on it, then got to his feet,
was hit, fumbled the ball, Chuck Smith grabbed it, and raced to the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion followed. First, the Jerry Markbreit officiating crew
ruled no touchdown, but an Atlanta recovery. Then that was
reversed, and the 49ers were awarded the ball on a ruling that when
Kirby fell on the ball, he was touched by a Falcons' player, so
Kirby was down.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the officials appeared to be right, although TV replays
were a tad shaky on the play. The 49ers scored on that possession,
then added a late first-half field goal. Instead of 21-0, the
Falcons' lead was 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became emotional over that call _ you can't help it on
something like that,'' said Reeves. But his heart held up, and in
the end, so did his team.

Rev. Al Sharpton, left, and Norman Siegel, executive director of
the New York Civil Liberties Union, have vowed to fight against
Gov. George Pataki's proposal for a statewide database of
information on the DNA of all felons. They say the plan threatens
privacy and exceeds any legitimate law enforcement needs. ``It's a
major mistake to equate DNA samples with fingerprints and say they
are used solely for identification purposes,'' says Siegel. (Nicole

Rep. Henry J. Hyde, fourth from right, the House members who will
present the impeachment case to the Senate at a meeting Friday.
After initial reports of the president's affair, Hyde reacted to
what he clearly saw as a lot of loose talk about impeachment by
saying: ``You don't impeach him for a peccadillo.'' A year later,
angered by what he came to see as Clinton's cavalier attitude
toward the law, Hyde's position hardened considerably. (Carol T.

close ties to the Senate. (Paul Hosefros/New York Times Photo)

more doctors to quit HMOs. ``Doctors' opposition to managed care is
on the increase in other parts of the country as well,'' says
Sachs. Chief among doctors' complaints have been reduced fees and
more restrictions from the insurance companies on referrals and

for his belief in animal experimentation. ``It's very easy for
agitators to create the impression that mad scientists are doing
horrendous stuff to helpless pet kitties when it isn't true at

unlikely lightning rod for the abortion debate. Although her case
might not be an enormous issue, in this staunchly Catholic area of

debate. (Keith Meyers/New York Times Photo)

 &HT;    This time, team ready to go further
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Well, here they are, right on schedule, regular as
clockwork, making hay in the playoffs every 18 years. Our good and
honorable and trustworthy Atlanta Falcons. Once they were the most
abused team in the league, now they're a week away from playing for
the championship of the National Football Conference. And (just say
this in a whisper) one game away from the Super Bowl. Wow!
</P>
<P>
   Roll that around in your head again: Atlanta Falcons one step
away from the Super Bowl. Don't say it out loud. Somebody will look
at you cross-eyed and wonder if you're daft.
</P>
<P>
   People come from faraway places to see them play. News
conferences draw like a state of the nation speech. Some of our
press compadres haven't seen the Falcons in so long they thought
they still played outdoors. They were delighted to be in the
Georgia Dome on a savage day to watch them scrimmage the San
Francisco 49ers for the privilege of playing the Vikings or
Cardinals next Sunday for a trip to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly and earnestly, they'd prefer the Cardinals for reasons
like, well, they'd have the game at their own hearthside, and they
have a dread of playing the Vikings in that dismal warehouse known
as the HumphreyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Outside on Saturday, the weather was frightful. Inside it was so
delightful, but agonizing for the better part of three hours. You
see, the 49ers are old hands at this stuff, playing postseason,
winning Super Bowls, swashbuckling through teams unaccustomed to
all the glitter. We were issued a booklet called ``NFL Postseason
Guide'' before the game. The Falcons didn't get a lot of type. The
last time they were this close to the the Pearly Gates of pro
football was in 1980 and they blew that in the last few minutes at
the now nonexistent stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the Falcons had scored twice and led 14-0, creating a
deceptive air of comfort. Then strange stuff began to happen in
this, the Year of the Blundering Official. The last two minutes of
the second quarter would become pure hell. Steve Young threw a
lateral pass at Terry Kirby. (Kirby was in the game because
Garrison Hearst, the pride of Lincolnton, Ga., went down on the
first play with a broken leg.) It appeared that Kirby fumbled the
backward pass, two Falcons pounced on him, the ball bounced into
the hands of Chuck Smith, who strutted his way to the end zone.
Falcons score!
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jerry Markbreit and crew got through labored
legislation, the ball had been awarded to the Falcons at the spot
where Kirby recovered, then back to the 49ers. At any rate, the
Falcons had no touchdown, nor the ball. The crowd lost its
disposition, happy now that they had heard before the game that Mr.
Markbreit was refereeing his last.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers scored.
</P>
<P>
   Then a tipped pass came down in Junior Bryant's hands, and the
49ers big lummox was tackled at Atlanta's 36. Wade Richey kicked a
field goal in the last second, all of this after the two-minute
warning, which the Falcons should have taken literally. It was a
confusing and irritating moment, enough to cause a man who has just
had heart surgery, such as Dan Reeves, to have a heart attack.
Blessedly, he didn't. You'd have sworn that every indicator of the
first half pointed toward the Falcons sinking in the end. Yet, they
survived a second 49ers touchdown, and a botched snap that Ty
Detmer turned into a two-point conversion, and they sweated it out
down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Through all those vexing moments the name of a player long gone
kept running through my mind. Rolland Lawrence. Lawrence was a
defensive back on the team that lost to Dallas in the last minute
in 1980, the player whose coverage broke down on the deciding
touchdown. As the insufferable memory ran past again, I turned and
looked straight into the face of Leeman Bennett, who coached the
team that lost to the Cowboys. He winced. I winced.
</P>
<P>
   But now it was over. Reeves and his reconstructed heart had made
it through a day that began with a dog show, mutts chasing
frisbees, and had turned into what he called something ``beyond my
wildest dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever had a team that came this far this fast?'' he
was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teams I've had before never had this far to go,'' he said.

 &HT;    Some in Salt Lake consider moving Olympics amid bribery scandal
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bribery, corruption and now a sex scandal involving
the bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics have some people in Salt Lake
City wishing the Games would go jump in the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's best to cut our losses now and get out of this
thing and let the Games go to Calgary,'' Deeda Seed, a city council
member and one of the most vocal critics of the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee, said Saturday. ``Let's spare our city the
pain and agony of being a second-rate Olympics before we even light
the flame.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving the Games would not be unprecedented: The people of
Colorado voted in a 1973 referendum to give back the '76 Games,
which went to Innsbruck, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Seed admits that hers is a minority opinion. Still, the
controversial _ and potentially illegal _ bid practices, which
forced the committee's two top officials to resign Friday, have
Salt Lake City's 200,000 citizens reeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here in this city is people who are walking
around in numb disbelief,'' Seed said. ``We're all shocked and
horrified; it's so counter to the values that are espoused in
Utah.''
</P>
<P>
   SLOC has acknowledged that the bid committee, which lost the
1998 Games to Nagano by four votes then won in a landslide four
years later, paid as much as $70,000 to certain IOC members;
provided free medical care for IOC members and their families;
financed a scholarship program that benefitted the relatives of six
IOC members; and gave gifts that exceeded the allowable limit of
$150.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest bombshell, the Utah governor's office revealed
Friday that a SLOC internal ethics panel was investigating
allegations of prostitution. These allegations, including whether
credit cards belonging to the bid committee were used to pay for
escort services for IOC members, have not been substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound, an IOC member from Canada who is leading that
group's internal investigation, told the New York Times, ``There's
not anything we've seen like that. They can't even get their own
dates? If it happened, it will all come out.''
</P>
<P>
   And that would be even more embarrassing for Utah's citizens,
most of whom are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect it's going to have on Mormons is not sinking in
yet,'' said Stephen Pace, who heads a local citizens watchdog
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be very hard for the LDS church to stay
strongly in support of the Olympics and also look each other in the
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fear that those who attend the Games, which are scheduled
to begin in three years and one month, will rub salt in the wounds.
Seed said it's inevitable that the Olympics will be the butt of
jokes, such as, ``The best Games that money can buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has so tarnished the Olympics that sponsors are
skittish and organizers may have to scale back the Games if some
funding falls through. And city and state officials are worried
that the 2002 Games, with a budget of $1.45 billion that was
supposed to come from private sources, will lose money. Who will
pay the difference? After the Atlanta Games, the IOC began
requiring a government entity to guarantee the Olympics in case of
a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mike Leavitt said Friday that the 17-page contract signed
between state and Salt Lake City officials in 1991 violates Utah's
constitution, which prohibits the state from guaranteeing any
public or private debt.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt has promised that the city will not bear the debt alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is saying, `Trust me,' and the legislators are
saying, `We're not going to pay,' '' Seed said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the city council at its Tuesday meeting must examine
the validity of the contract, which could be null and void because
of the acts of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Seed said the contract states that ``the bid city has an
obligation to maintain the good name of the Olympic movement. What
about the IOC maintaining the good name of the bid city? We have
been trashed. In order for bribery to be committed, there has to be
somebody accepting the bribe, and here we have the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   Anita DeFrantz, one of two U.S. members of the 115-member IOC,
said some of her brethren involved in the scandal would be asked to
resign at a meeting Jan. 23-24 in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we will have executions, but we will have fewer
members,'' she told the New York Times. ``There are a few
individuals who have abused their privilege. We must have them
removed from the Olympic movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the SLOC ethics panel, which hopes to wrap up its probe
by Thursday when the organizing committee's board meets, and the
IOC, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the U.S. Justice Department are
also looking into the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Games' focal point _ the athletes _ haven't lost their
desire to compete in Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``As athletes, we all kind of shrug,'' ski star Picabo Street, a
member of SLOC's board of trustees, told the Chicago Tribune. ``We
think, `That all kind of stinks, but just let there be an Olympics
for us to compete in.' There is still pride to be felt in the
purity of going to the Olympic Games and representing your country,
regardless of the politics involved.''
</P>
<P>
   SLOC must now replace Frank Joklik, 70, and David Johnson, 40,
the Games top two organizers. Luckily, most of the facilities are
finished or will be completed by November 2000. Joklik will stay on
the job until a successor is named.
</P>
<P>
   Pace believes that members of the board of trustees should also
be forced out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not thrown enough bodies out of the lifeboat yet to
keep it afloat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt called the trustees of a ``systematic cover-up,'' by
those who handled the payments, but Pace thinks there should have
been adequate oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their only defnese against being charged with being corrupt is
that they're incompetent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pace and Seed will speak at a public forum Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has just sapped all the enthusiasm right out of the
thing,'' Seed said. ``It's hard to be cheerful and excited about an
event that was solicited in the most unsavory fashion you can
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson broke his silence when he told the Salt Lake Tribune
that the gifts given by Olympic organizers were not bribes because
no votes were guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time was there a quid pro quo,'' he said. ``So it was
not a bribe. It was a secret ballot. Even if an IOC member said he
was going to vote for you, you never knew if he would. Salt Lake
City won on its merits.''
</P>
<P>
   But now those merits have been all but forgotten. Said Pace,
``I'm kind of amazed at how fast it seems to be coming apart.

 &HT;    Still flying: Falcons advance to NFC Championship
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS, SIDEBARS
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A prince and a pauper met in the middle of a 100-yard
field Saturday afternoon. When they had finished pounding on each
other, the longtime underling had emerged from beneath the boot
heel of NFL royalty to remain the only one standing.
</P>
<P>
   And a crowd of 70,262 in the Georgia Dome went nuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons, long one of the NFL's doormats, defeated
the old nemesis San Francisco 49ers 20-18 to advance to next
Sunday's NFC Championship Game for the first time in the
franchise's 33-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The victory left Falcons front office personnel in tears, and
several players ran around the field like they'd lost their minds.
</P>
<P>
   With Super Bowl XXXIII one victory away, the Falcons (15-2) will
play the winner of today's Arizona-Minnesota game.
</P>
<P>
   But after the game, the next opponent didn't matter as much as
the last.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (13-5) has won five Super Bowls in the last 18
years, advancing 12 times to the NFC Championship Game in that
span. Add the fact that San Francisco beat Atlanta 10 of the last
12 times and 22 of 28 before this season, and it's easy to
understand defensive end Lester Archambeau's dramatic statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is awesome,'' he said after his team's 10th straight
victory and second straight against the 49ers. ``Beating the team
that has been the bane of our existence is just incredible. I think
it's fitting that the road to the championship game had to go
through San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons looked to be in great shape after taking a 14-0 lead
on a 34-yard run by Jamal Anderson (29 carries, 113 yards, two
touchdowns) with 3:12 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But they managed just 90 of their 289 yards after that.
Fortunately, the defense, despite allowing 273 yards in the second
half, came up with three second-half interceptions to seal
Atlanta's 10th straight victory at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were acting like 21-year olds out there after (strong
safety Williams White's interception on the final play of the
game),'' said weakside linebacker Cornelius Bennett, who
participated in four Super Bowls with the Bills. ``Back in training
camp, probably nobody predicted this. We might have said 10-6 (for
a record), but nobody predicted this. This is right up there with
anything in Buffalo.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves was on the sideline for the first time since
undergoing quadruple heart bypass surgery on Dec. 14, and it's a
good bet his heart rate was up much of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the keys were exactly those mentioned by Reeves
earlier in the week. The Falcons outrushed the 49ers 136-46 and won
the turnover race 3-1 _ partly because San Francisco had to pass a
lot more after running back Garrison Hearst from Lincolnton broke
his leg on the first play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference two weeks makes!'' Reeves said. ``I feel a
lot better. I just thought we did the things we needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After Jamal Anderson (29 carries, 113 yards, two touchdowns)
dove the final 3 yards to finish a 34-yard scoring run, Atlanta had
a two-touchdown lead and had outgained San Francisco 199-61.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, though, tension covered the Dome like the rain
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Without Hearst, the 49ers still had Young (23 of 37, 289 yards,
one touchdown, three interceptions) and receivers Terrell Owens
(eight catches, 73 yards) and Jerry Rice (three catches, 63 yards).
And they began to make things interesting immediately after
Anderson's touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It began when officials reversed a call giving Atlanta a fumble
recovery _ and negated a 45-yard return for a touchdown by Chuck
Smith _ giving it back to the 49ers. Rice scored on a 17-yard pass
from Young to complete a seven-play, 82-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than run out the clock, the Falcons _ who had all three
timeouts left _ opted to go for more points. On their second play,
San Francisco defensive end Charles Haley batted a pass by Chris
Chandler (13 of 19, 169 yards, one interception), and defensive
tackle Junior Bryant intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   A 36-yard Wade Richey field goal as time expired cut the Falcon
lead to 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   Interceptions by safeties William White and Eugene Robinson set
up a pair of Morten Andersen field goals in the second half. The
second, a 32-yarder that came after an interception and 77-yard
return by Robinson, gave Atlanta a 20-10 lead with 10:33 left in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco wasn't finished, though, going 87 yards in 13
plays to score on Young's 8-yard scramble with 2:57 left. A bad
snap on the extra point led to a two-point conversion pass. That
left San Francisco a field goal from victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like holding your breath at the end,'' Chandler
said. ``We didn't do a very good job running out the clock, and I
was hoping it wouldn't haunt us.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco got the ball at their 4 with 38 seconds left and
no timeouts. The fifth and final play _ as time expired _ was a
Hail Mary down the right sideline, intercepted by White.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have got that interception, too,'' Robinson said. ``I
was in the pile and Will was next to me. I said, 'I love you, man.'
He said, 'I love you.' It was back and forth, 'I love you,' 'No, I
love you,' 'No,I love you.' ``
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, there was a lot of that going around.

 &HT;    Canucks in a rut
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A three-hour meeting with coaches in a Dallas hotel
room on the eve of the game must not have solved too many problems.
The Vancouver Canucks continued to play at a level consistent with
their disparaging nickname the other night, losing to the Stars 6-4
to extend their losing streak to seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bure, the franchise centerpiece, continues to wait out a
trade in Moscow, kissing off an $8 million contract. Mark Messier,
imported from New York to draw some attention to this end of
Canada, is 38 playing like 48 and feeling like 58. Coach Mike
Keenan was so frustrated after a recent loss, he suggested it might
be time to ``fire the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Reclining on this bed of nails is Brian Burke. The former NHL
disciplinarian was a finalist for the Thrashers general manager
position before settling for his second-choice offer as GM of the
Canucks. Burke hated living in New York and was worn down by his
role as Gary Bettman's attack dog. But now one wonders if the view
in British Columbia is worth being one of the most second-guessed
executives in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to be back on a team,'' Burke said. ``I missed
winning and losing. But being a part of losing is not much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   When the most uplifiting news is limited to defenseman Bret
Hedican announcing plans to marry Kristi Yamaguchi, things aren't
going well for your hockey team. The biggest problem for the
Canucks has been the absence of Bure _ or, at least, the absence of
someone in his place. The Russian Rocket scored a team-high 51
goals last season _ Messier was a distant second at 22 _ but has
demanded a trade. He won't say why, and he declined to play this
year.
</P>
<P>
   It was assumed that Burke would have made a deal by now for
scoring help or a starting goalie. But of the two most interested
teams, Los Angeles didn't want to part with some of its talented
prospects and New York, scared off by Burke's high demands, made a
deal with Pittsburgh for Petr Nedved.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope was that (Bure) would come in and play for us and he
would give us a deadline for a trade, like Dec. 1,'' Burke said.
``But he wouldn't do that. So I've got to make the best possible
deal for this team. If the deal's not right, I'm not making it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke maintains that the market is heating up again, that as
many as seven teams are now talking about a deal _ Florida and New
York are the front-runners _ and that something could be close to
happening. But there have been teases before. The upside is that
the Western Conference is so down this season _ only four of 13
teams are above .500 _ that a playoff berth remains viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to look at this thing as the glass being half
empty,'' Burke said. ``But the fact is we're one point out of a
playoff spot, and we don't have Bure, and (forwards Alexander)
Mogilny and (Todd) Bertuzzi have been hurt. Given that, most people
would've thought we'd be 20 points out by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Such rose-colored views do little to appease Keenan, who has
sounded off a few times about personnel problems and is used to
having total control over such matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've disagreed at times, but that's always the case between
general managers and coaches,'' Burke said. ``The problem is the
general manager's goals are not the same as the coach's. The GM
wants to win the Stanley Cup. The coach wants to win every night.
The coach goes from 7:30 to 10 o'clock thinking about how to get
two points. The GM thinks, 'We might lose tonight, but we won't
lose in the long run.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's done a good job. But he's frustrated. He's a hot-headed
Irishman, just like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Little else is hot in Vancouver.

SPORTS COLUMN: BRIBING MILLIONAIRE DELEGATES, AND A FEW OTHER
IDIOCIES

been linked to giving gifts and CORRECT that only other official
resigned, sted some others; minor editing changes elsewhere.) 
 (JT) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the National Basketball Association has solved the
perplexing problem of how to share a few billion dollars, it dawns
on me that there are many more unresolved idiocies out there in the
sporting world just waiting to be attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one idiocy I'd like to cut off at the pass: the fervent
American participation in bribing millionaires. Apparently, the
Salt Lake City Olympic people have been passing out money, college
tuition, health care and who-knows-what condos and other goodies up
in nouveau ski-chalet country, in return for a few little favors
from some (or maybe many) International Olympic Committee
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   These delegates, who choose Olympic sites every two years, are
already well-heeled and well-positioned in their home countries,
and the IOC effectively licenses them to roam the world with
gunnysacks, playing one bidding city against another.
</P>
<P>
   This stuff may go on in the rest of the world, but it is a
dreadful practice for America, and I'll tell you why. Nobody is
more sanctimonious about ``our way of life'' than Americans. We
like to say we are the most moral, righteous folk on the planet,
but we don't necessarily act that way when it is against our
self-interests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While roaming the dreary streets of downtown Atlanta in the
fetid summer of 1996, I kept muttering, ``What were the delegates
thinking when they overlooked Toronto and Melbourne?'' (The
delegates themselves were holed up in exclusive hotels, whisked to
events in air-conditioned limousines.)
</P>
<P>
   I now have to wonder if every time I complained to an Olympic
official about the squalid T-Shirt Shack Games, I was talking to
somebody who had taken a few favors from the Atlanta organizing
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Until further notice, I will feel the same way about the
legitimacy of Salt Lake City as the host of the 2002 Winter Games.
There was a mandatory first step Friday and then with the
much-too-belated resignation of Frank Joklik, the chairman of the
organizing committee, who has not been linked to the ``gifts,'' and
one of his top officials. However, the taint of the sleaze will not
vanish by 2002. All future American bidding cities must take an
oath not to grease IOC delegates and similarly suspect characters.
</P>
<P>
   You have to nip bad ideas in the bud, before they become a
habit, like the designated-hitter rule. If only more people had
screamed, ``That's not baseball!'' we would not have had a quarter
of a century of lumbering retreads and endless games and an entire
American League without a shred of strategy. But we let it go, and
it festers still.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of rampant idiocies, this one in the real world,
is the ghastly increase in vehicles careering around corners with
drivers barely in control, gabbing animatedly into a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   It would never have come to this if only a police officer had
pulled somebody over and said, ``See here, sir, you can't drive
with a headset on, or a dog in your lap, so you surely cannot drive
talking into a cell phone. Hold out your wrists, I'm cuffing you
and taking you down to the station.'' But it didn't happen that
way, so we all have to cringe when conversational drivers are on
the loose (disproportionately trying to control sport utility
vehicles, but that's another story).
</P>
<P>
   Here's a home-grown North American idiocy: the continued
separation of baseball umpires between National and American
leagues, producing different strike zones, different techniques,
different attitudes. Baseball was going to blend the two sets of
umpires _ as in every other major sport _ but baseball, once again,
has been divided and conquered by Richie Phillips, the head of the
umpires' union. I'm sure the new commissioner will jump right on
this when he takes over.
</P>
<P>
   My last idiocy for today concerns the greatest sports event in
the world, the World Cup of soccer. Because it is held only once
every four years, the World Cup induces billions of fans to say
``Back in Mexico in 1970'' or ``back in Italy in 1990,'' with a
sense of history and awe.
</P>
<P>
   Now, somebody wants to dilute, diminish, reduce, cheapen the
World Cup by holding it every two years. The scary thing is that
the threat to the World Cup is none other than Joseph (Sepp)
Blatter, the new secretary general of the world soccer body known
as FIFA.
</P>
<P>
   Blatter seems to forget that players spend a good deal of the
four years preparing and qualifying for the World Cup, and that
fans build up their emotions from year to year. A World Cup game is
staggeringly vital because there is not only no tomorrow, there is
also no next year.
</P>
<P>
   What really worries me about Blatter's blather is that the same
international types who run the IOC also run FIFA, and that there
is money to be made from inspection trips, from television and
construction and licensing, and that World Cups are greased by
presents from hopeful countries. The largess from Japan and South
Korea, which led to a highly shaky partnership in 2002, has become
legendary. Sepp Blatter should be far too worldly to want to be
connected to a biennial swarm to the global trough.
</P>
<P>
   This is surely just the first in a regular series exposing
idiocies, in and out of sports. We haven't even addressed obnoxious
cell-phone users on commuter trains, or four-hour college football
games, have we?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's agreement on how to conduct the
initial phase of President Clinton's impeachment trial sent House
prosecutors and the president's lawyers diving this weekend back
into the voluminous evidence collected by Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In the 7,000 pages of grand jury testimony and boxes of
supplementary evidence, Rep. Henry Hyde, the leader of the House
prosecution team, sees a clear and convincing picture of perjury
and obstruction of justice so grave that Clinton should be removed
from office.
</P>
<P>
   From that same pile of evidence, the president's legal team is
putting together a more aggressive defense than the one it
presented unsuccessfully to the House _ one it now says should lead
to the president's acquittal. The White House offered to accept the
record of testimony amassed by the independent counsel, although
the president's lawyers profoundly disagree with Starr and Hyde
about what the evidence shows.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers will argue that instead of proving that
Clinton lied or obstructed justice, the evidence shows only that
Clinton tried to conceal the embarrassing details of an improper
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, according to interviews and
legal documents they have prepared for the Senate trial. Though the
president's actions and behavior were ``reprehensible,'' Charles
Ruff, the White House counsel, has said, they were not unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's Republicans and Democrats spent this week sparring
over whether to call witnesses, virtually all of whom have already
testified under oath before Starr's grand jury. On Friday, the
senators agreed to defer until late January a decision on whether
to summon witnesses _ and if so, which ones.
</P>
<P>
   That decision will dramatically affect the length and tenor of
the trial. And perhaps more important, both the president's
prosecutors and his defenders can point to many of the same
witnesses and testimony as buttressing their respective cases.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment proceedings in the House involved legal jousting
over the constitutional standards for high crimes and misdemeanors.
Although those arguments will be heard again in the Senate, the
House prosecutors and White House lawyers are preparing to lock
horns directly on the factual details of the case. In those
details, each side sees a starkly different picture.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the prosecution team wants to call Betty Currie,
the president's secretary, and Vernon E. Jordan Jr., a Washington
lawyer and presidential confidant, to question them, respectively,
about gifts and job help Ms. Lewinsky received from the president.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the impeachment article charging the president with
obstruction of justice are accusations that Clinton schemed with
Ms. Lewinsky to hide gifts subpoenaed in the Paula Jones lawsuit
against the president, and that efforts by Jordan to help Ms.
Lewinsky find a job were intended to buy her silence in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   But the testimony of Ms. Currie and Jordan before the grand jury
also forms the cornerstone of Clinton's defense against
obstruction. Ms. Currie testified that it was Ms. Lewinsky who
asked her to retrieve the gifts, and Jordan said there was no quid
pro quo between his help in finding Ms. Lewinsky a job and her
affidavit in the Jones case denying a sexual relationship with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of Ms. Lewinsky also cuts both ways. She testified
that the president engaged in sexual activity with her that fell
within the narrow definition of sexual relations in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   That pits her word against the president's denial before the
grand jury on Aug. 17 that he had lied in his civil deposition in
the Jones case. In the Jones deposition, he said he had not engaged
in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. The president's insistence
that his testimony in the Jones case was not perjurious is another
charge outlined in the impeachment article.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Lewinsky also testified that no one asked her to lie and
that she was not offered help finding a job to secure her silence
in the Jones case. That testimony undercuts the heart of the
obstruction of justice case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not witnesses are called, the prosecution and the
defense will highlight selected portions of the testimony of
crucial figures like Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie and Jordan for their
own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   That is all the more certain given that much of the case against
the president is circumstantial and turns on subjective views of
his intentions and interactions with Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie,
Jordan, other White House aides and his lawyers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most difficult charges for the president to rebut
are contained in the article of impeachment charging him with lying
before the grand jury about the nature and details of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Lewinsky testified in detail
about 11 sexual encounters with the president. That testimony is
perhaps the most problematic evidence confronting the president's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Because Clinton told the grand jury that he did not have sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky as defined in the Jones case, the
evidence on this point boils down to his word against hers.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team must decide whether to try to
undermine Ms. Lewinsky's credibility with other evidence. Among
that evidence is the testimony of witnesses and friends of Ms.
Lewinsky who said that she told them things that may have been
untrue, like that the Secret Service brought the president to Ms.
Lewinsky's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the president's lawyers paint Ms. Lewinsky as a
liar, their ability to use her testimony to support other aspects
of their case, particularly on obstruction of justice, could be
hindered.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution team will try to broaden its perjury case by
charging that the president lied about other details, like when his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky began, the frequency of their
meetings and the number of times they had sexually explicit
telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team will emphasize that Clinton admitted
to an ``inappropriate, intimate'' relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
before the grand jury. They will argue that differences between the
president's and Ms. Lewinsky's descriptions of the number and
specific details of their sexual encounters are not significant
enough to support a perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the president has testified that he thought the
sexual activity in which he engaged with Ms. Lewinsky fell outside
the definition of sexual relations in the Jones case. However, this
argument has provoked criticisms that the president and his lawyers
are engaged in tortured legal hair-splitting.
</P>
<P>
   The perjury article of impeachment also charges the president
with lying when he told the grand jury that he did not lie in the
Jones case and with letting his lawyer in the Jones case, Robert S.
Bennett, falsely deny that the president and Ms. Lewinsky were
sexually involved. It also accuses the president of lying to his
aides about his dealings with Ms. Lewinsky. The charges involving
Bennett and the aides are repackaged in the second article of
impeachment involving obstruction of justice, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team thinks these accusations are more
easily rebutted. They will argue that he thought he was being
technically truthful, even if he was misleading, during the Jones
deposition. Hardly intending to lie to his aides in order to
influence their future testimony, the president's defenders will
explain, he was trying to conceal from his friends and family an
improper relationship about which he was deeply embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   The article of impeachment charging obstruction of justice turns
on the belief of both Starr and the House prosecutors that the
president wanted Ms. Lewinsky to testify falsely in the Jones case
and that he also sought to influence other potential witnesses,
like Ms. Currie, his aides and his lawyer, Bennett, to give false
accounts of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. In return for her
false testimony, Ms. Lewinsky was to be rewarded with help finding
a job.
</P>
<P>
   In the perjury case, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is at odds with
crucial aspects of the president's account. In the obstruction
case, the prosecutors must make a circumstantial but highly
suggestive set of facts support a sweeping accusation. None of the
witnesses involved in the events, including Ms. Lewinsky, Ms.
Currie and Jordan, has testified that the president asked them to
lie, schemed to hide evidence or tried to enlist help to keep Ms.
Lewinsky quiet.
</P>
<P>
   In both the Starr referral and the final House impeachment
report, great weight is given to gifts that the President gave Ms.
Lewinsky that she later turned over to Ms. Currie. The gifts were
subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee concluded that Ms. Currie would
not have retrieved the gifts unless asked to do so by the
president.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ms. Currie testified that Ms. Lewinsky asked her to
collect the gifts, and the president has denied asking Ms. Currie
to retrieve them.
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis of her testimony by the president's
lawyers, Ms. Lewinsky has given 10 different accounts of her
conversations with the president about the gifts. In none of those
conversations, they will argue, did the president instruct Ms.
Lewinsky to conceal the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Currie also testified that she felt no pressure or
intimidation from the president, who is accused of trying to
influence her testimony, and she was not named as a witness in any
proceeding when the president talked to her about Ms. Lewinsky.

 &HT;    Secondary comes in 1st
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One is in his final years, and the other isn't far
behind. Or, as William White insists while distinguishing himself
from Eugene Robinson, ``He's already down the hill. I'm kind of at
the top of the hill, but I haven't gone down yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Old and slow seldom is a successful equation for an NFL safety
tandem. But Sunday, old and slow equaled three interceptions. Old
and slow helped morph the Falcons' secondary this season into
something other than standup material. Old and slow has helped
carry a perennial losing franchise into the NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to two Super Bowls, to the Pro Bowl, and I've done a
lot of special things,'' Robinson said Sunday after his
third-quarter interception helped prevent a Falcons collapse and
preserve a victory against San Francisco in the divisional
playoffs. ``But to be playing with this group of guys means a lot
to me. I mean, when I saw how hard Jessie Tuggle hit (49ers
fullback Marc Edwards) on one play, I almost cried. We were the
lowly Falcons. But not anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons secondary has made big plays all season, so it was
fitting that Robinson and White, who both left successful teams and
signed with Atlanta as unrestricted free agents (Robinson this year
from Green Bay, White in 1997 from Kansas City) made the difference
Sunday. In fact, the game ended with them briefly wrestling for the
ball and the game-ending interception by White at the Falcons' 35.
</P>
<P>
   When Young heaved the desperation pass downfield for J.J.
Stokes, Robinson said, ``I got to the ball first and I had my hand
hands on it. But when I saw Eugene there, I let him have it. I
didn't want a fumble.''
</P>
<P>
   Said White, ``I thought Eugene was one of their guys, that's why
I held onto the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   While the final interception ended a threat, earlier ones were
momentum killers. Late in the third quarter, with the 49ers
trailing only 14-10 and at the Falcons 23, Young threw into the end
zone for Terrell Owens. But Owens was well covered, the pass was
behind him and Robinson read the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I had to do was step in front of him,'' Robinson said. ``I
thought to myself, if I get this ball, I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson not only made the interception, he returned it 77 yards
to the 49ers 20. That set up a Morten Andersen field goal to give
the Falcons some breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say thanks to the Green Bay Packers for letting
Eugene get away,'' defensive end Chuck Smith said. ``He really is
like the quarterback for our defense back there. Everybody thought
he was too slow to play anymore. They said he was dead. But all
he's doing is starting in the Pro Bowl and taking us to the NFC
title game.''
</P>
<P>
   White's turn came next. After Andersen's field goal, the 49ers
drove to the Falcons 44. This time, Young threw over the middle for
tight end Greg Clark. But Clark stopped his rout, never cut outside
and White stepped in for the interception. White said Clark
actually was Tuggle's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jessie kind of (overplayed) the run,'' White said. ``When I
saw that, I stayed inside with the tight end. Luckily, we had a lot
of pressure on (Young) and he had to get rid of the ball, and I got
a good break.''
</P>
<P>
   White set up another field goal with a 14-yard return, before
being forced out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about trying to go all the way,'' White said, ``but
I got tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the abbreviated return, the Falcons are within one
victory of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a fluke we're in this position,'' White said. ``We
need to be here; we deserve to be here. We don't want to stop now.
It's like losing can become a habit _ so can winning. There's
probably still a lot of people around the league who don't respect
us. But we don't look at ourselves as Cinderellas. We want to prove
to ourselves that we belong here, so we bust people in the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   And take away their passes.

 &HT;    The fumble that wasn't
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons defensive end Chuck Smith telephoned
former teammate Deion Sanders on Friday night, telling the Dallas
Cowboys star that he was going to unveil his version of the ``Dirty
Bird'' on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my own dance,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith got his opportunity in the second quarter, when he picked
up an apparent San Francisco fumble and returned it 45 yards down
the sideline for what he and almost everyone else who was watching
thought was a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But in what has become an all too familiar occurrence in the NFL
this season, officials negated the score and awarded possession to
the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials ruled that San Francisco running back Terry Kirby, who
dropped a backward pass from quarterback Steve Young, recovered the
ball at the 49ers' 45-yard line. Referee Jerry Markbreit said Kirby
was down by contact. Replays seemed to indicate that Markbreit's
crew made the right call.
</P>
<P>
   After recovering the ball during a scramble, and apparently
being downed by contact, Kirby lost the ball again when he tried to
stand and run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was clearly our ball,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves
said. ``I didn't see any way they could get the ball. I still don't
understand it, even after watching the replays. But those are tough
decisions, and that's why we should have instant replay.... It
didn't look like he ever had possession. He got up and the ball was
down (on the turf).''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kirby) never had control of the ball,'' Falcons linebacker
Henri Crockett said. ``I didn't know what was going on. He got up
and started running and fumbled the ball. We should have had the
ball. That's wrong and (the NFL) has got to get a hold on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was surprised no whistles were blown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a whistle and they let it go,'' he said. ``If the
ball is supposed to be dead, you blow the whistle.... It was still
a live ball. I was in the end zone, I was dancing. I think nobody
wanted to make the decision. If they wanted to save a lineman some
energy, they could have blown the whistle about 50 yards earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   The call seemed to stun the Falcons. San Francisco needed only
four plays to score. Young threw a 17-yard touchdown to Jerry Rice
with 1:10 left in the half, cutting Atlanta's lead to 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking a three-touchdown advantage into halftime, the
Falcons led only 14-10 after the 49ers then turned a Chris Chandler
interception into a Wade Richey 36-yard field goal as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had the game well under control, and it looked
like we were going to be up 21-0,'' Reeves said. ``All of the
sudden, they get 10 points at the end of the half. But I thought
our team did a good job of putting it behind us at the end of the
half. We've done a good job of that all year.

 &HT;    Anderson plays off emotions
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a flight to Atlanta from Salt Lake City last Sunday
night, Jamal Anderson deemed himself fit and rested from the bye
week and eager get back to work. He chatted with passengers, signed
autographs and generally exhibited a demeanor that was jovial and
fresh. Not long after landing, however, he learned an uncle in New
Jersey died, and his spirit was sapped.
</P>
<P>
   His emotions told him to skip practice leading to Saturday's
49ers playoff game and fly north to comfort, and be comforted by,
family. Coach Dan Reeves told him to go, but Anderson did what
McCleveland Moore, his uncle, would want. Play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very emotional, tough week, man,'' Anderson said. ``I
thought I needed to be here. My uncle was here (for the Miami
game), and I know that he'd want me to be ready for this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was more than ready. He said he was so hyped that, ``in
the first quarter, I had to slow down my breathing, I was so fired
up. My attitude was that we were not going to lose this game.''
</P>
<P>
   He did his part to ensure they would not. ``The Catalyst'' had
113 yards on 29 carries, with touchdown runs of 2 and 34 yards. The
34-yarder was a highlight reel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A super job,'' Reeves said in assessing Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Those were not exactly the words or tone he used in addressing
Anderson with 38 seconds left. It was then that Anderson ran out of
bounds on third down, stopping the clock that gave San Francisco
one last _ and as it turned out, futile _ attempt to pull out a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   It all worked out in the end. Reserve linebacker Ben Talley
dumped R.W. McQuarters at the San Francisco 4 on the punt return,
and the defense closed matters. But Anderson's gaffe was so
inexplicable that he addressed it before being queried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you want to ask me about the bone-headed play,'' he
said. He went on to explain that he felt a leg buckle and was
fearful of sustaining a serious knee injury, so he ran out of
bounds. ``I want both my knees for a few more years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that the play was a wide pitch. Anderson said,
jokingly: ``It was a terrible play called by Dan.''
</P>
<P>
   In victory, even the most fundamental of errors are dismissed as
easily as Anderson did 49ers cornerback Merton Hanks. After getting
the wind knocked out of him early in the second quarter and sitting
out a couple plays, Anderson returned and burst into the secondary
off a solid Brian Kozlowski block. Up came Hanks, who immediately
got pushed back at the 20.
</P>
<P>
   With Hanks in pursuit Anderson rambled to the 5, where he went
airborne into the end zone. ``When I get close, I won't be
denied,'' he said. ``I practice diving. My sisters taught me to
cartwheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hopes he and his offensive line taught the league a
lesson. ``People keep saying, `Jamal won't Dirty Bird on us,''' he
said. ``But nobody's stopped us yet.''

 &HT;    Unexpected contributions
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pride reigned over happiness in the victorious Falcons
locker room Saturday. At the midway point of last season, they were
1-7 and showing the vital signs of a cadaver. Now, ``We're still
playing in 1999,'' linebacker Jessie Tuggle said, in accomplishment
as much as joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone deserves what has happened to this team,''
quarterback Chris Chandler said. ``Hopefully, everyone in the city
is as happy and proud as we are in this locker room. This is a long
time coming.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, the achievement of advancing to the franchise's
first-ever NFC Championship Game was duly celebrated but not over
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've settled down,'' cornerback Ray Buchanan said. ``But, I
tell you, during the game the fans had me so emotional. They saved
me. It was electrifying out there. Whenever I got tired, I just
looked into the crowd and took some of their energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, we've calmed down some. We can watch (today's
Minnesota-Arizona) game and relax. But we have a lot to be proud
of. We really do. We won as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons got the expected contributions from the starters and
a few from lesser-knowns. Linebacker Ben Talley pinned the 49ers on
their 4 with an open-field tackle on punt returner R.W. McQuarters;
rookie Keith Brooking kept a punt from going into the end zone as
the Falcons down the ball at the 1. And Gary Downs had a 16-yard
run for a first down that set up Jamal Anderson's 34-yard
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a remarkable turnaround for this team,'' Downs said.
``This has been building for two years. We learned how to win. The
guys wanted it so badly. With me, it's about staying ready for an
opportunity. The hole was there for me and I hit it. Sometimes when
you get a chance, the hole doesn't develop. This time it did, and I
took advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the trademark of a quality team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of players who play hard and who play well,''
defensive tackle Chuck Smith said. ``This is so great because we
earned it as a team. The feeling right now is incredible. And we
earned the right to feel this way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get enough of this feeling,'' said linebacker
Cornelius Bennett, who's advanced this far five times in his
career, four with Buffalo. ``You look at the other teams that are
at home. Those guys would give their whole salary to be where we
are.''

 &HT;    Fumble! Refs drop ball, hear it from announcers
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It would be easy to single out the rip job that
announcers Dick Stockton and Matt Millen laid on the officiating
for the questionable call on the 49ers fumble as the standout
moments of Fox's coverage Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And make no mistake about it, their criticism was as strong as
you'll ever hear out of announcers with no rooting interest for
either team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it made me mad,'' Millen said later. ``It changed the
whole game. But it did give us some drama and a better game than
the last time these two teams met.''
</P>
<P>
   During the telecast, Millen called the ruling that disallowed
the fumble recovery by the Falcons' Chuck Smith ``a complete farce.
This is unbelievable. I don't care what the league says, they are
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Then after the 49ers scored to cut Atlanta's lead to 14-7,
Stockton said Jerry Rice's touchdown ``shouldn't have been,
frankly. The crowd is disturbed over this officiating mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox studio analyst Terry Bradshaw joined the outcry, derisively
saying the officials ``huddled like a hen over a baby'' and never
blew the play dead with a whistle. But his colleague Cris
Collinsworth took the opposite view and said the call was correct
because ``his (Terry Kirby) knee was on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much mileage as the Fox announcers got out of the
controversial play, the work of director Artie Kempner and his crew
was even more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   It kept appropriate tabs on Falcons coach Dan Reeves' reactions,
most notably a shot of Reeves raising his arms and urging the crowd
to get loud after Atlanta went up 20-10, and delivered other gems
away from the ball like Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler slamming
down the phone in frustration after having to settle for a field
goal, and 49ers kicker Wade Richey dejectedly holding his head in
his hands after his kickoff went sailing out of bounds in the
closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fox could have cut back on those skin-crawling replays
of Garrison Hearst breaking his leg on the game's first play from
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, like the Falcons, Millen got over his disgust with
the officiating and dropped in some clever one-liners to go along
with his keen analysis.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after Jamal Anderson picked up a big first down
with two minutes left, Millen said the play hit the 49ers like ``a
shot to the head from (Mike) Tyson.''

 &HT;    Reeves returns, his presence felt
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler and his wife,
Diane, are expecting their third child any day, so Chandler hasn't
exactly been preoccupied with the health of coach Dan Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reeves, who underwent emergency quadruple bypass surgery
on Dec. 14 and missed the Falcons' final two regular-season games,
was a welcome sight for Chandler on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, shadowed throughout the game by team physician Charles
Harrison, and protected at times by assistants when plays headed in
his direction, was back on the sideline as the Falcons advanced to
the NFC Championship Game with a 20-18 victory over San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me personally, having him on the sideline was a reassuring
feeling,'' Chandler said. ``When the game started, it was nice to
be able to talk to him and ask him some things. The two games that
he wasn't on the sideline, I was missing some of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the game starts, though, I'm not worried about his
health. It's nothing personal. My wife's due any day now, and I
don't even worry about her once the game starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves returned to the practice facility in Suwanee last week
and participated in planning. It wasn't officially decided until
Saturday morning, however, that he'd return to the sideline for the
first time in nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said he couldn't yell nearly as loud as he'd like,
although he barked at officials after a controversial call in the
first half. After the game, Reeves said he felt fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a lot better than I've felt over the last two months,
as far as my heart is concerned,'' Reeves said. ``I just know that
I can't do a lot of things that I want to. I never felt that tired.
I felt good throughout the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves wasn't as involved usual. Quarterbacks coach Jack Burns
continued to relay plays from the press box. But Chandler heard
backup quarterback Steve DeBerg in his in-helmet receiver, instead
of Reeves, who offers suggestions and sometimes changes plays.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Rich Brooks, who served as interim coach
during Reeves' absence, returned to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could concentrate in between series, looking at all the
pictures and communicating with my defensive staff,'' Brooks said.
``I didn't have to worry about fourth-down plays or whether or not
to accept penalties. I didn't have to worry about the offense, so I
could just concentrate on defense.

 &HT;    Young ran out of time
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The dream finish for the San Francisco 49ers on the
touchdown catch by Terrell Owens in last week's miracle against
Green Bay turned into a nightmare on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It only took one play. Running back Garrison Hearst, a Pro Bowl
selection who ran for 1,570 yards this season, broke his leg while
being yanked down by defensive end Chuck Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-yard gain. Big-time loss.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst had come into the game with a hamstring strain and left
with much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Things got even worse for the 49ers moments later, when Hearst's
backup, Terry Kirby, hurt his knee on a punt. Kirby got kicked
while he was making a block and joined Hearst in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said 'What are you doing here?' `` said Kirby, who added
that Hearst's mood at the time was one of disgust.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Kirby couldn't put any weight on his knee, but he
got a shot that numbed the pain and he was able to fight his way
through the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, when you have two tailbacks, what can you do?'' Kirby
said. ``One guy has to go. ... This team has a lot of fight. There
are a lot of dogs on this team. They have a lot of character. We're
not going to lay down and give it to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a strong running game, San Francisco's chances hinged on
quarterback Steve Young, who was forced to try to move the team by
passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Garrison out, it was a big load on me,'' Young said.
``The great thing is we fought back to make it 20-18 with three
minutes to go. I sensed we'd win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really had a shot. I was looking for another great finish.
With Garrison out early, we had to be perfect and we made a couple
mistakes. I tried like heck to overcome them, and I ran out of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Young had stepped to the microphone for his
post-game interview, clean from his shower and still hoarse from
trying to yell over 70,262 mostly-Falcon fans, reality had set in.
The 1998 season was over, and any consolation was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing shy of a Super Bowl victory usually translates into
disappointment for the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell from this locker room that there's somewhat of a
train-wreck feeling,'' Young said. ``I don't think there's anyone
in here who thought we weren't going to go (all the way).''

</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS to update with Rangers suspending Tikkanen.) 
(bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was just a coincidence, getting sick to my stomach while
covering the hurting New York Rangers this past week. In Washington
in time for Thursday's game, but unable to travel the last mile
from hotel bed to press box, I listened, instead, to the Capitals'
radio announcer screaming: ``Richter is down and out! The Capitals
score!'' He said so on every goal. Lapsing in and out of sleep,
redreaming the play-by-play between headaches, it seemed as if the
score were 15-1 instead of the 5-1 result shown in the morning
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The radio clicked on the next morning to the same station. Don
Imus was interviewing Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. ``I hate hockey,''
Imus said to McCain. ``Well,'' McCain replied, ``you ought to go to
a game.'' It was one of the best things any senator said all week.
And it was time to shuttle back to New York ahead of the snow to
contemplate the Rangers as they approach the halfway point of the
1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't a bad team. Worse than bad, they are mediocre, good
enough to raise hopes and then dash them. They can win on the road
and lose at home, beat some good teams and lose to some bad ones.
Still possessing one of the league's oldest and most expensive
rosters, the Rangers probably have enough talent, professionalism
and stubbornness to contend for a playoff berth, at least until the
last snow melts. As bad as they have looked in losing their last
two games, their near-term schedule suggests a turnaround. Their
next four games are all against current last-place teams _ Tampa,
the Islanders, Chicago and Montreal. All except Montreal are at
home. All except Montreal are preceded by a day or two of rest,
which older Rangers really need.
</P>
<P>
   The game against the Islanders on Wednesday is No. 41 of an
82-game schedule which is as forgiving as it is long. Down the
stretch, the right trade or two could put the Rangers in the
playoffs, guaranteeing at least two lucrative gates at Madison
Square Garden. It is the sort of thing top management might
consider in evaluating Neil Smith, the president and general
manager, now in his 10th season. His bosses forgave one dark
spring. Two in a row might be pushing it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will probably have to do it without Esa Tikkanen,
the funny Finn who refused to report for his demotion to the
Hartford farm club. He has been formally suspended by the Rangers,
the team announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Tikkanen was supposed to get a salary bonus after 40 games on
the major league roster. He has threatened to file a grievance
because he cleared waivers while nursing a knee injury that
apparently worsened only when he was put on waivers. Teams can't
waive injured players. A Ranger spokesman said that Tikkanen was
due to see a doctor Friday and he had been expected to report to
Hartford on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tikkanen's departure leaves the Rangers dressing only 10 players
ages 30 or older among the 20 in uniform for each game. Their age
could be why they looked so weary Thursday in Washington in playing
their third game in four nights, according to those who witnessed
the debacle. Tikkanen was supposed to fit in so well with Wayne
Gretzky and the whole coaching staff. He knew them back in Edmonton
in the 1980s, when all were younger. So much for cronyism and
wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Smith's roster moves have worked out so badly. He has
improved the team with trades for Petr Nedved, Todd Harvey, Peter
Popovic, Mike Knuble and Mathieu Schneider. John MacLean was a
decent free-agent signing and so was Brent Fedyk. Draftees like
Marc Savard, Dan Cloutier and Manny Malhotra have been impressive.
(And how long will it be before coach John Muckler gives more
playing time to Cloutier and Malhotra?) Smith and Muckler have had
less success with pickups of Stan Neckar, Rumun Ndur, Scott Fraser,
Chris Tamer and Sean Pronger.
</P>
<P>
   More tough decisions are approaching. Brian Leetch, Adam Graves
and Ulf Samuelsson could walk away as unrestricted free agents next
summer. Wayne Gretzky has an option year left on his contract. All
four are over 30. All four are among the top 10 Rangers. Those four
might earn a combined $15 to $20 million next season. All are good
citizens, but their contracts could make Smith woozy in the
stomach, ready to head for bed.

 &HT;    Tenn.-UConn rivalry renewed today
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ As the standard-bearer in women's college
basketball, Tennessee is finding that living up to last season's
electrifying 39-0 record and a third NCAA title in a row is a tough
task.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 Lady Volunteers meet top-ranked and undefeated
Connecticut this afternoon boasting impressive, if not always
spectacular, results. And they would be the first ones to concede
that they're not exactly on their best game.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the best rivalries in college basketball, Tennessee
will try to win at UConn for the first time since the series began
in the 1994-95 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols, whose 47-game winning streak was snapped by
Purdue in the second game of the season, have endured the loss of
three players to injuries and a typically brutal Pat Summitt
schedule. But they're not worried about playing every game with the
same unrelenting zeal they did a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we haven't come out as sharp as we did last year,''
senior point guard Kellie Jolly said. ``We're trying to get better
every day, because what counts is what we do in March.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does this game mean, then, beyond bragging rights and
the national hype that comes with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's a big rivalry, and we want to win every game,''
said UConn freshman forward Swin Cash, who is questionable with a
leg stress fracture. ``But it's just another game. I'd like to
play, but I'm focusing on the long term rather than right now.''
Not so for rabid Husky fans and the media, who figure it could be a
sneak preview of the national championship game. The 10,027-seat
Gampel Pavilion has been sold out for months, and scalpers were
asking as much as $200 for an upper-level ticket earlier this week.
The school handed out more than 175 media credentials.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing more popular around here _ other than
UConn's No. 1-ranked men's team _ is the Disney On Ice show that
bounced basketball out of the Hartford Civic Center, where the game
originally was scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   UConn, which has scored 100 points or more nine times, leads the
country in scoring at 100.1 points a game, while Tennessee is third
at 87.6; Georgia is sandwiched in between at 93.1.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have transformed themselves from a plodding
half-court team into a copy of Tennessee last year, with a constant
running and pressing style.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play so hard; they play so intensely,'' Lady Vols
All-American Chamique Holdsclaw said. ``It should be a great game,
but we have so many big games. We can't be overly excited about any
one game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the approach the Huskies are taking. This state
has been a madhouse for women's hoops ever since UConn topped
then-No. 1 Tennessee here four years ago on the way to a 35-0
record and a national championship. Local fans often overreact
after every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, we're a lock to win the national championship,''
UConn coach Geno Auriemma said sarcastically. ``If we lose, we're
not going to make the NCAA Tournament.''

ISLANDERS LOOK TO FUTURE, AND SEE A GOALIE THERE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Far from Long Island, where for the fifth straight season the
New York Islanders are nowhere close to making the playoffs, there
is help in Canada for the struggling franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Luongo, the Islanders' first-round selection in the 1997
National Hockey League draft, is biding his time in the small towns
of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. Widely considered to be
the best goalie in juniors, the 19-year-old Luongo led a moderately
talented Canadian junior national team to a world championship
silver medal last week and was named outstanding goaltender of the
tournament. In a few years, the Islanders expect him to be leading
them to the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a reason he was the highest drafted goalie ever,''
said Mike Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general manager. ``In
time, we believe that he can be an elite goaltender. His
performance in the world juniors last week proved that.''
</P>
<P>
   Luongo, who was picked fourth over all in the draft, was invited
to the Islanders' training camp last September and played in
several preseason games. He flashed a deft glove hand, had
lightning-quick feet for a 6-foot-3-inch, 190-pounder and showed
intense concentration. But there were technical aspects he had to
improve.
</P>
<P>
   So after an inconsistent month in camp with the Islanders, a
disappointed Luongo was sent back to the juniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, I was disappointed not to make the team,'' Luongo
said by telephone from his home near Montreal on Friday. ``I
thought I might have had a chance to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   If Luongo were a little older, he would be closer to Long
Island, with the Islanders' minor league team in Lowell, Mass. But
players must be 20 to play in the American Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Luongo took an ordinary Val d'Or team to the Quebec
Major Junior Hockey League title and a berth in the Canadian junior
championship, the Memorial Cup. Named the league's top prospect,
Luongo posted a 27-20-5 record and a 3.09 goals against average in
54 games last season, respectable numbers considering the defense
in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Luongo would have preferred to have made the NHL this year, but
he now agrees that returning to the juniors was the right decision.
He was not ready for the NHL. Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the issue of a contract standing between Luongo
and the Islanders. Luongo's agent, Gilles Lupien, and the Islanders
failed to work out a deal by Oct. 1, the deadline to sign with a
junior team and still be eligible to be called up to the NHL during
the season. Several people close to Luongo said the sides had
reached an agreement in principle since then, though many details
remain open. Lupien met with Milbury on Friday in Montreal, and it
is expected that Luongo will sign a three-year deal worth about
$2.25 million later this month.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Luongo has been having a season he will not
soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Luongo lay flat on his back on the ice in
Winnipeg, Manitoba, as the Russian junior national team piled up in
front of him, celebrating the overtime goal that gave it a 3-2
victory over Canada in the championship game. The disappointment
overwhelmed Luongo. Reaching the final was a proud moment for him
and for the Canadian team, which had been embarrassed the year
before. But for the ultracompetitive Luongo, second was not good
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best experience of my life,'' Luongo said. ``It was
high pressure, playing against the best players. But even though we
won the silver, I was very disappointed. I wanted to win a gold
medal. That's why you go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordie Clark, the Islanders' director of player personnel, who
deserves much of the credit for selecting Luongo, attended the
tournament. ``He made several key saves at key times,'' Clark said.
``He was their best player. Roberto took an average Canadian team
and gave them a chance to win a gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   When Luongo returns to the juniors this week, the pressure will
again be on him. During the two-week world championship tournament,
he was traded from the struggling Val d'Or to a contending team,
Acadie-Bathurst of New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an Italian immigrant father and an Irish-Canadian
mother, Luongo speaks English, Italian and French. He grew up in
St. Leonard, a town north of Montreal known as Little Italy, and
began playing hockey at the age of 8. He always wanted to be a
goalie, but his parents, Lina and Tony Luongo, insisted that he
first learn to skate. A few years later, when Luongo was cut from
his peewee team, he became a goalie. His idol is Grant Fuhr, the
St. Louis Blues goalie, ``because of his spectacular glove saves,''
Luongo said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many future NHL goaltenders from Quebec, at 15 Luongo
joined Montreal-Bourassa, a midget team that has produced the
Devils' Martin Brodeur, the Toronto Maple Leafs' Felix Potvin, the
Los Angeles Kings' Stephane Fiset and the former Islander Eric
Fichaud, among many others. Under the direction of the goalie
coaches Mario Baril and Francois Allaire, a longtime assistant
coach with the Canadiens and most recently the Mighty Ducks of
Anaheim, Luongo began showing signs of potential greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaching in Montreal for goaltending is excellent,'' said
Allaire, who coached the Colorado Avalanche star Patrick Roy when
he played for the Canadiens. ``The athletes have never been so
good, too. The best players in Quebec, when they are young, want to
be goaltenders. Not many players can say, `I'm as good or better
than any goalie in the world at my age.' Roberto can.''
</P>
<P>
   One look at Luongo's gangly frame and his size-15 feet, and it
is obvious that he possesses the physical attributes. But all of
his coaches agree that it is his intelligence that sets him apart.
While playing for Acadie-Bathurst, Luongo plans to take
correspondence courses from a college in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders have no plans to rush Luongo, but even the most
conservative predictions have him playing some, if not most, of
next season with them as Tommy Salo's backup, though he may start
the season in the American Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting drafted so high, yeah, there's pressure on me,''
Luongo said. ``But if you're going to play the game at this level,
you have to deal with that. I haven't proven anything in the NHL
yet, but hopefully I will.''

 &HT;    More changes expected for Lightning
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A professional sports league always wants to hold its
top events in the best surroundings. It's difficult to imagine the
NHL could have worse timing for its All-Star Game weekend in Tampa
in two weeks. Going into the weekend, the Lightning was the only
team still in single digits in the win column. The firing of Phil
Esposito, promotion of Jacques Demers and addition of former Flames
executive Cliff Fletcher have accomplished little, and it figures
to be only a matter of time before owner Art Williams, the former
Atlanta insurance executive, mandates more changes. Forward Wendel
Clark said the team has ``played just well enough to lose.'' There
had been season-long rumors that the Lightning would acquire
Toronto goalie Felix Potvin, but he was traded to the Islanders
Saturday. In any potential Tampa Bay deal, coach and general
manager Demers has nothing to give up except top prospects. ``If I
wanted to give up our kids, I could probably have had (Potvin) in a
second, but I'm not going to do that for anyone.'' Welcome to
Tampa, commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Better this way
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur is not having one of his best
seasons statistically _ .901 saves percentage, 2.44 goals-against
average _ despite the Devils' place atop the Atlantic Division
standings. But he attributes the inflated numbers to New Jersey's
new wide-open style under coach Robbie Ftorek _ and prefers it this
way. ``It's a big change, but it's lot of fun,'' he said. ``The
first five years here under Jacques (Lemaire), my statistics were
really good, compared to other goalies. Now I'm in the middle of
the pack, but it's a good tradeoff. There's not as much pressure
because the team scores more goals. That's pretty cool. Now when we
get down a couple of goals, I know it's OK, and I'm not scared
we're going to lose the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Tugnutt
</P>
<P>
   In a year seemingly dominated by Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek,
it's worth noting that Ottawa's Ron Tugnutt actually leads the
league with a 1.81 goals-against average and is third in saves
percentage, .929. Tugnutt is rotating in the Senators' lineup with
Damien Rhodes. Tugnutt: ``The way we've been playing, it's not hard
to put up good numbers It's a tribute to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Esa Tikkanen is not going to get a stronger message that it's
time to retire. Tikkanen, 33, who has played on five Stanley Cup
teams, cleared waivers and was demoted to the minors by the
Rangers. The timing of the move? If Tikkanen had been on the roster
for the team's 40th game today, he would have earned a $200,000
bonus. ... Florida is central to trade rumors with Vancouver (Pavel
Bure) and Calgary (Theo Fleury). ... This might be the most
depressing stat of all for the Isles: They are 1-12-4 in their last
17 games against lowly Chicago.

 &HT;    Thrashers pick up insight on draft contenders
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Thrashers had a rotating group of six people
scouting the World Junior Championships in Winnipeg, which
concluded last week, and came away with some valuable insight on
potential draft picks, according to player personnel director Bob
Owen. ``Our coverage of the players has been pretty extensive, so
we already pretty much knew what they can and can't do,'' Owen
said. ``This tournament was more about the intangibles, like how
the young handle the pressure.'' Many of the top draft-eligible
17-year-olds struggled in the spotlight. Owen said most of the
players who performed the best already are the property of NHL
teams. NHL teams usually return their top draft picks to the
juniors after the draft for experience, much like a major-league
baseball team starts a high school draftee in the low minor
leagues. Among those who had problems were Swedish twins Daniel and
Henrik Sedin, who many project as two of the top five selections.
Canadian media even took to referring to the two as the ``Sedate''
twins. Sweden, a pre-tournament favorite, also came away without a
medal. (Russia defeated Canada in the final.) ``Everybody wanted a
piece of the (Sedins),'' Owen said. ``There wasn't a game where
they weren't abused because they were so highly publicized going
in. The pre-tournament hype was, stop them and you stop the team.
They tried to fight their way through it, but this is a tough
tournament when you're only 17 years old.'' Four other top-10
prospects _ Russia's Denis Shvidki, Finland's Jani Rita, Michael
Sivek of the Czech Republic and Tim Connolly of the U.S. _ fared
slightly better than the Sedins. The Czechs' Patrik Stefan, who is
playing with Long Beach of the IHL, did not participate in the
tournament because of an injury. ... The Thrashers' scouting staff
will hold its mid-winter meetings Jan. 17-20 in Fort Lauderdale,
the week before the NHL All-Star game in Tampa. ... The Thrashers,
in conjunction with Nike and the NHL, will donate equipment and
help launch an Atlanta street hockey program for inner-city youths.
Specifics of the program will be announced in about three weeks.
Similar ventures have been launched in other NHL cities.

   The Asheville (N.C.) Smoke of the bottom-level United Hockey
League has lost 50 percent of its marketing campaign. The Smoke, a
franchise that relocated this year from Brantford, Ontario, the
birthplace of Wayne Gretzky, and boasted two of Gretzky's brothers
on the team, lost one of them this week. Forward Brent Gretzky, who
played for the IHL's Atlanta Knights and briefly in the NHL with
Tampa, signed with the IHL's Chicago Wolves. Keith Gretzky remains
coach and general manager of the team. Brent Gretzky had signed
with Asheville after leaving a team in Austria. But he clearly was
overqualified for the UHL, scoring 26 goals and 62 points in 29
games. He has now played for nine teams in five leagues in three
countries. ``I'm definitely not ready to leave hockey,'' Gretzky
said. Of the UHL, he said, ``It's a plumber's league. There's a lot
of stuff on the ice that shouldn't be happening, a lot of cheap
shots. Some guys are a little out of shape and they get
embarrassed, so they have to stick their stick in you.''

 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz

<P>
   ATLANTA _ After losing only three of their first 24 games
(18-3-3), the Coyotes won only three of their next 12 (3-7-2),
including Friday's loss at Anaheim. Worse, they went 1-3-1 on a
five-game homestand that included two fights in a practice between
teammates Jeremy Roenick and Oleg Tverdovsky. Roenick yelled at the
defenseman about messing up in a drill and tempers flared. It was
coach Jim Schoenfeld's hope that the blowup actually would help
pull the team together. Instead, Phoenix was drilled the next night
by the injury-depleted Edmonton Oilers, 7-1. ``I haven't seen too
many teams that don't have a few disruptions,'' Schoenfeld said.
``If you care, you're going to get upset sometimes.'' Hold the
Stanley Cup talk.

   Goodbye, Patrick?

   Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy, who would be one of the most
sought-after unrestricted free agents if he doesn't re-sign with
Colorado, is downplaying a three-week-old dispute between him and
coach Bob Hartley that became public only this week. After being
pulled during a game in Anaheim Dec. 21, Roy argued with Hartley in
the locker room and busted two television sets and a VCR with his
stick. Roy now says, ``I had an argument _ that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   But some people wonder if it moves him a step closer to leaving.
A dispute between Roy and then-Montreal coach Mario Tremblay led to
the goalie demanding a trade from the Canadiens in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Couch potato
</P>
<P>
   Look for the Colorado Avalanche to get a boost on their power
play now that point man Sandis Ozolinsh has signed three months
into the season _ although the boost may not be immediate. Ozolinsh
concedes he's not in peak condition. ``I have to practice and get
more contact where I have to make quick decisions, then we'll
see,'' he said. ``I'm in pretty good shape. I actually played golf
a bit. Hey, that's a sport. They show it on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' Luc Robataille scored his 500th career goal Thursday,
not bad for a guy who was drafted five spots behind a kid out of
Boston named Tom Glavine. Yes, that one. ... Another reason for the
NHL to copy international hockey's no-touch icing rule: The Kings'
Glen Murray tore a knee ligament last week when he fell after
racing a Colorado player to the puck to secure an icing against the
Avalanche. (In the NHL, icing is waved off if the offending team
reaches the puck first.) ... Detroit is 3-13-1 against teams that
are .500 or better. ... So if Brett Hull is wrecking Dallas'
chemistry and coach Ken Hitchcock is a tyrant, how could the Stars
build a 15-game unbeaten streak?

IT WAS ONE FIGHT QUARRY COULDN'T WIN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Short of hearing ``world champion'' before your name, there is
perhaps nothing that makes a fighter prouder than to hear someone
say of you, ``He can really take a punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you take too many of them.
</P>
<P>
   That was the sad fate of Jerry Quarry, a fierce heavyweight
warrior in the '60s and '70s who died recently at the age of 53 no
longer knowing who he was besides a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Quarry had long suffered from what is medically known as
pugilistica dementia. In the gyms he used to frequent in Los
Angeles, they call the condition being punch drunk and sadly shake
their heads when they say it.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Quarry died punch drunk, a brave man who took too many
punches too well for too long. He took them from Muhammad Ali on
Oct. 26, 1970, the night Ali returned from exile to batter boxing's
newest Great White Hope until his eye split open and the fight had
to be stopped over Quarry's protests.
</P>
<P>
   He took them from Joe Frazier, who twice busted him up, and from
Jimmy Ellis the night he lost his only shot at the heavyweight
title, and from Floyd Patterson, whom he fought twice and beat
once, and from Ken Norton, who knocked him senseless at a time when
Quarry had begun to train with a liquor bottle, not a water bottle,
by his side.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, as a once-proud career wound down without a
heavy-weight title coming to him, drugs and alcohol began to hit
him, too, and in time he lost everything. He lost the $338,000 he'd
made for going three rounds with Ali and the $500,000 he had saved
from the $2.1 million he earned during his years as a top
contender, and he lost all three of his wives. Worst of all, he
lost his mind.
</P>
<P>
   By 1983, Quarry had already been diagnosed with the early stages
of dementia. He had not yet suffered the short-term memory loss
that would slowly rob him of all recollection and lead a prominent
California physician to declare three years ago that Quarry had the
brain of an 80-year-old man because prizefighting had stolen 30
years from him.
</P>
<P>
   He had not yet been robbed of his motor skills, either, a
process that began not long after that but didn't stop him from
trying an ill-advised comeback in 1992 after he'd convinced himself
he could be another George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback lasted one night, which was one night too many. It
came in Colorado, a state with no boxing commission, and that was
no accident. Quarry took a good punch that night. He took a lot of
bad ones, too, from a pug who shouldn't have been able to hold his
robe for him.
</P>
<P>
   Quarry lost a six-round fight and much of what was left of his
brain. He got paid $1,050 and soon began to slip off into a cloudy
world in which his family had to spend most of their time caring
for him. This went on until he was hospitalized Dec. 28 with
pneumonia and suffered cardiac arrest while there.
</P>
<P>
   For one last time, Jerry Quarry took the blows and refused to
fall. He kept fighting until the end, refusing to go down until his
family took him off life support after being told he would be
bed-ridden and fed through a tube for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He finally went down then because there are some blows no man
can stand up to. But he went down the way he had lived. Jerry
Quarry went down fighting.

   Promoters of  &UR; Mike Tyson's  &LR; return to the ring next Saturday
against  &UR; Francois Botha  &LR; reportedly are pumping an estimated $25
million into advertisements. After Tyson's diatribe last week, they
may need every penny of it. About 25 minutes into a teleconference
with the media, Tyson went into a scathing indictment of society
for how it constantly misrepresents who he is and how he acts.
After being asked ``Do you still feel a kinship with  &UR; Sonny
Liston &LR; ?,'' Tyson responded, ``A guy like me, my credibility is
shot. A guy like  &UR; Mitch Green &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is a known crack, heroin,
stardust, starburst, name the drug, angel dust, everything
(addict), he could say I did something to him. In the court of law,
which we should respect, the Supreme Court of law would say, `I
believe Mitch Green.' He's beaten people up, robbed gas stations,
murdered people almost, offended people, and he's still walking the
streets. He robbed a gas station, beat the gas attendant up and
started pumping the gas. The cops arrested him because he was on
heroin, angel dust, or whatever. He went to jail for a couple of
days, a couple of weeks. He's on the street right now. If the
sleaziest tramp in the history of the world says that Mike Tyson
raped her, then society would believe her. My credibility is shot.
People like to see Mike Tyson (messed) up. I feel a great affinity
with (Liston). I'm a man. I stand on my own two feet. I don't
depend on anybody. I don't say this guy is my best friend and he's
rich and powerful, this guy is my man and he's the Mafia. Be a man
and stand on your own two feet. Stop sucking up to people who you
think are the right guys to be associated with. Don't be
politically correct. Be correct within your own two feet.'' Huh?
Tyson was earlier asked what he expected Botha to do. His reply was
about as frank as a fighter can be. ``I expect for him to go down,
be out cold,'' said Tyson, which is one of the reasons he gets paid
$30 million and remains America's most fascinating sports
personality even in his decline ... Heavyweight contender  &UR; Michael
Grant's  &LR; trainer,  &UR; Don Turner &LR; , said, ``This is Michael's year for
a title shot,'' but quickly added that it will come only if
 &UR; Evander Holyfield  &LR; defeats  &UR; Lennox Lewis  &LR; and then retires,
because Turner trains both Holyfield and Grant and believes the two
would never fight. ``That won't happen,'' Turner said. He believes
Holyfield wants to unify the title March 13 against Lewis both to
fulfill a dream and ``to get out.'' ... At 28-0, Grant is an
attractive personality as well as a prospect, and he fights  &UR; Ahmad
Abdin  &LR; (25-1-3) Jan. 30 on an HBO card that was supposed to also
match  &UR; Andrew Golota  &LR; vs. tough  &UR; David Izon  &LR; (22-3). When Golota's
people got cold feet and replaced Izon with the considerably more
beatable  &UR; Jimmy Thunder &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Turner remarked, ``Why don't they put
him in with  &UR; Joe Louis &LR; ? Joe's 84 and dead.'' ... IBF welterweight
champion  &UR; Felix Trinidad  &LR; and former pound-for-pound champion
 &UR; Pernell Whitaker  &LR; were in New York last week to formally announce
their Feb. 20 fight at Madison Square Garden. That fight has come
two years too late for Whitaker, who has been off for 16 months,
serving a suspension after failing a random drug test. He remains a
skillful and elusive boxer, as he showed against  &UR; Oscar De La
Hoya &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but he was already on the slide before his layoff and 16
months of ring rust will only make it tougher for him to stay away
from the much harder-punching Trinidad for long. Their fight will
begin an exciting 21 days of boxing at the Garden, which is trying
hard to regain the status it once held as the mecca of the sport. A
week after that fight, the latest Great White Hope,  &UR; Lou
Savarese &LR; , &UR;  &LR; squares off with  &UR; Shannon Briggs  &LR; and  &UR; Will Taylor
 &LR; fights  &UR; Reggie &LR;   &UR; Johnson  &LR; on HBO's ``Boxing After Dark,'' and 13
days after that, Holyfield and Lewis meet in the biggest
heavyweight fight since Holyfield-Tyson ... Not everyone in England
was pleased to hear that  &UR; Prince Naseem Hamed  &LR; had been awarded the
Order of the British Empire at the age of 24. ``The kid is 24 and
has won a couple of minor versions of world titles,'' said revered
British heavyweight  &UR; Henry Cooper &LR; . ``I think they should have left
it a couple of years. Hamed has said some things the British Boxing
Board should have punished him for, but they didn't.'' Hamed is
31-0 and owner of the World Boxing Organization featherweight
title.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Promoter  &UR; Don King  &LR; is planning a Feb. 6 middleweight mania
night on Showtime from Washington in which all three of the
reigning 160-pound champions may defend their titles. King is
hoping International Boxing Federation champion  &UR; Bernard Hopkins
 &LR; will face a mandatory rematch with  &UR; Robert Allen  &LR; after their
first fight ended in bizarre fashion _ Hopkins fell out of the ring
after being pushed by referee  &UR; Mills Lane  &LR; and injured his ankle so
badly he could not continue. That fight is not set, but already on
the card is World Boxing Association champion  &UR; William Joppy  &LR; vs.
No. 1 contender  &UR; Darren Obah  &LR; and World Boxing Council titleholder
 &UR; Hassine Cherifi  &LR; vs. former champion  &UR; Keith Holmes  &LR; ... King, by
the way, has filed a countersuit to Tyson's $100 million suit,
claiming the former champion owes him more than $110 million for
biting Holyfield's ear and breaking his exclusive promotional
contract. While Tyson's lawyers are claiming King stole millions
from Tyson, King is claiming he overpaid Tyson by $7.5 million...
In case you missed it,  &UR; Christy Martin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the first woman to make a
mark in professional boxing, was upset by  &UR; Sumya Anani  &LR; recently in
Florida. Anani (12-0) won a majority decision over Martin (36-2-2)
to win the women's pound-for-pound title. She cut Martin's left eye
and nose in the first round and had her in big trouble in the third
but then had to hang on to win the bout, 96-94, on two judges'
cards. The third card had the fight a draw ... Ever the most honest
of men, Lane has said his recent decision to retire springs from a
combination of wanting to move into boxing commentary and feeling
it would be a conflict to both officiate fights and comment on
them, as well as the fact that at 61 he believes he's slowing down,
not reacting as quickly to the sound of the bell or the action in
front of him. If everyone in boxing were as stand-up as Mills Lane,
it would be a hell of a sport. If Sen.  &UR; John McCain  &LR; ever gets that
national commission off the ground, he could find a good man to run
it right there in Reno ... Hate to quarrel with old friend  &UR; Michael
Katz &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the oft-brilliant boxing writer of the New York Daily News,
but while his vote for fighter of the year went to  &UR; Shane &LR; 
 &UR; Mosley &LR; , &UR;  &LR; mine goes to newly crowned 130-pound titleholder  &UR; Floyd
Mayweather Jr. &LR;  There's no disputing Mosley's credentials. This
corner has suggested that he may be the pound-for-pound best
fighter in the world, but none of his five successful title
defenses in 1998 was as impressive as Mayweather's back-to-back
wins over champion  &UR; Genaro Hernandez  &LR; and  &UR; Angel Manfredy &LR; , &UR;  &LR; even
though the latter came on a far-too-quick stoppage. Mayweather was
dominant in his title victory, only his 18th professional fight,
over a seasoned pro whose only loss in 40 fights had come against a
far bigger De La Hoya.

AN UNFATHOMABLE SHELL GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.199 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometime this morning, Art Shell will finally get the
second chance he earned in 1994. Whether it's a real chance or not,
only Carmen Policy knows.
</P>
<P>
   The former head coach of the Oakland Raiders coached the
offensive line of the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC playoffs Saturday
against the San Francisco 49ers before flying off to Cleveland to
interview for the head coaching job of the new Browns. With Steve
Mariucci's contract extension in the works in San Francisco and
Mike Holmgren having landed in Seattle, it supposedly is an open
road now. If so, Shell has earned the right to be in the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Shell is truly a candidate for the job is anyone's
guess, because many believe this is just a token gesture by the new
Browns to placate the NFL, a league whose players are 73 percent
black but whose head coaches today number only two blacks out of a
possible 30.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL says it hopes someone will give another black coach a
chance after the firing in Philadelphia of Ray Rhodes, but it seems
powerless to get that done, and no amount of videotaped job
interviews is going to change that. The league recently began such
a practice, making a collection of tapes available to teams looking
for head coaches and coordinators, and Shell agreed to take part in
the charade even though he knows nobody in history ever got a job
off a videotape except in the TV business.
</P>
<P>
   When the tape idea was first made public, New York Jets
linebacker Bryan Cox ripped it, and quite rightly. Cox may be a
loon at times but he was right on this issue when he said, ``From
my perspective, if I was a black coach, how I would feel is that
I'm getting another slap in the face. (If you're a white coach)
they're flying you out to these places to talk to them face to
face, but if you're black, they want to be able to go pull out a
video.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is that saying to you? `Oh, we're trying to get to know
you?' You're not trying to get to know me because if you were,
you'd fly me out there to talk to you, too. To me, it's just a
better way to kick us in the ass without us knowing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Shell understands Cox's point, he went along because he
never wanted it said that he hadn't taken advantage of that
program. Yet he is well aware of the shoddy minority hiring record
of NFL teams looking for head coaches, coordinators, and top
personnel men, and he knows, too, that the men who run the league
(and are nearly all white, by the way) know they need to change
that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Shell is a proud man who has never asked to be given
anything but the same chance as his colleagues. He seized his
chance as an athlete and ended up in the Hall of Fame as one of the
greatest offensive linemen of all time. When he finally got his
chance as a head coach, he went 54-39 from 1989-94, a winning
percentage of nearly .600. He took three of his six teams to the
playoffs, including a 12-4 team to the AFC Championship game in
1990, before being fired in 1994 after going 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   After Shell's departure, the Raiders slumped to 8-8, 7-9, and
4-12, plowing through two more head coaches before Jon Gruden got
them back to 8-8 this season. Yet Shell has never been called to
interview for another head coaching job. Not once during a time
during which 19 white men have been hired has Shell been called,
even though only three of the men who got jobs had a record
comparable to his and many barely had a .500 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Shell never mentions all of that, however. He talks only of his
belief in himself and his record, a position that may not cost him.
As fellow coach Don Blackmon, the ex-Patriot linebacker, says,
``Art just goes about his business. He's old school. People from
his era believe you don't lobby for things. You earn them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is filled with self-promoters. If that's what it
takes to get a head coaching job, he won't get it. But if they go
by his performance, by his winning percentage, he'll get another
chance. His track record speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it does, which is why the Browns won't wait if they're
smart. They will hire Shell not because he is the best black
candidate but because he's the best candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Shell was asked this past week about being a ``minority
candidate'' and he bristled, as he always has when race is brought
into the equation. When he became the first black head coach in the
65-year history of the NFL, Shell said he understood the
significance but chose not to consider himself a ``black'' coach.
That holds true today, not as an attempt to deny who he is but
rather to ignore it, as he wishes all people could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were well beyond that,'' Shell said after a
Falcons practice at the Georgia Dome. ``I'm a candidate as a
potential head coach. Not as a minority head coach. I'm glad to
have the opportunity to go out there and talk with them, whatever
the opportunity is.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Raiders, Shell coached the Kansas City
offensive line for two seasons and turned the Chiefs into the
league's leading rushers in his first year and the fourth-leading
rushers in his second even though he lacked a top-drawer running
back.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dan Reeves imported him to Atlanta last year to help
transform a run-and-shoot offense into a power running game. Jamal
Anderson has rushed for more than 1,000 yards both years and this
season piled up 1,846, the ninth-highest total in NFL history. But
numbers alone cannot measure a man or tell much about a coach.
People have to do that, and Reeves is glad to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Art,'' said Reeves, who in
his days as Broncos coach faced Shell's teams twice a year. ``I had
a difficult time beating his teams when he was at the Raiders. I
don't know his rec &UR; - &LR; ord, but he's way ahead of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``His teams were very well-coached. Art is a class individual
and a very knowledgeable guy and he has a great rapport with
players. That's both black and white players I'm talking about.
They have a great respect for him. His presence demands that. Our
offensive line would do anything for him.''
</P>
<P>
   So if he's such a great coach, why has it taken five years for
Shell to even be given an interview for a second chance, let alone
a second chance itself? Reeves believes he knows why, at least to
some degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think nobody knew for sure how much of it was him coaching
and how much of it was Al (Davis),'' Reeves said. ``I didn't know
myself. I have a great deal more respect for him now, having worked
with him here. I have no doubt the kind of job Art would do and no
hesitation about recommending him.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Shell gets the Cleveland job or not, he has at least
this time gotten his name in the mix. That is a start, which is
something. But it won't be finished until he gets what his record _
not his pigmentation _ has earned him.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots aren't talking about it, but they got more bad news
last week. Middle linebacker  &UR; Ted Johnson  &LR; will need surgery on his
left shoulder, according to a source close to him. That comes on
top of the torn right biceps that ended his season and would be the
second shoulder operation of his career. A year ago, it was his
right shoulder that had to be surgically cleaned out, and now it
will be the left. This has to be causing the Patriots more than a
little angst since they invested millions in him only a year ago,
and the tools of his trade _ his shoulders and biceps _ have
seemingly begun to unravel. Johnson is a hard-nosed player but he
takes a pounding at his position, and one has to wonder how long he
can hold up. If it's not for the long term, that $5 million-a-year
extension of a year ago could come back to haunt the Patriots ...
Although it appears that Patriots coach  &UR; Pete Carroll  &LR; will survive
this offseason, he has taken a pounding from several sides: former
players  &UR; Dave Meggett  &LR; and  &UR; Jimmy Hitchcock &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; more than a few of
his present players since the debacle at the Meadowlands; and
strength and conditioning coach  &UR; Johnny Parker &LR; , who conceded that
the offseason workout program since Carroll took over has not been
attended as religiously as it was under  &UR; Bill Parcells &LR; . &UR;  &LR; Parker
was telling the sad truth, which was reflected both in the
trainer's room and on the field. Carroll needs to acknowledge this,
not try to deny it, and do more than suggest workout bonuses be
increased. He needs to make clear to his players that while the
workouts technically may be voluntary, so is their inclusion on his
roster. But can he do that with any force? The jury is out on that,
but it's not a good sign that trainer  &UR; Ron O'Neil  &LR; was recently
dispatched to the home of  &UR; Terry Glenn  &LR; to check on the progress of
the receiver's recovery from ankle surgery; Glenn had not come
around to the stadium since his injury. That included the team's
breakup meeting last Monday ... Although Carroll doesn't yet appear
to realize it, he is on far shakier ground with management than he
knows. It is not simply because his team has underachieved, in the
opinion of some. It is because there is a growing concern in upper
management that his coaching philosophy does not dovetail with
personnel director  &UR; Bobby Grier's  &LR; approach to building a team. In
this era of free agency and constant roster turnover, Grier
believes teams must be built with young players and they must be
used before they are free to abandon ship for big bucks elsewhere.
But the growing concern is that Carroll's fervent belief that
players need to make the team their own by becoming responsible for
themselves is anathema to a young squad like the one Grier has
tried to put together. The fear is that Carroll's loose ways _ what
he likes to call the 49er Way _ might work with a veteran team that
has leaders such as  &UR; Jerry Rice &LR; , &UR; Steve Young &LR; , &UR; Tim McDonald &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and
 &UR; Merton Hanks &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but not with a basically rudderless ship of
younger players capable of doing something so asinine as voting out
 &UR; Bruce Armstrong  &LR; as postseason captain.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Here's the kind of thing that may explain to Tampa Bay fans why
their team is out of the playoffs again. Three of the six Pro Bowl
quarterbacks once wore the Buccaneers' logo. None do now. Young,
 &UR; Vinny Testaverde &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Chris Chandler  &LR; all labored for Tampa Bay
once. If  &UR; Trent Dilfer's  &LR; game doesn't improve, he could become the
next ex-Buccaneer ... Here's how times have changed.  &UR; today &LR;  the
state of Connecticut is ready to guarantee  &UR; Bob Kraft  &LR; $100,000 per
unsold luxury box and $4,000 per unsold club seat to lure him to
their state. Longtime Patriots season ticket-holder  &UR; Edward Modest
 &LR; sent along a copy of a 1970 renewal form for his two seats. Total
cost for the year: $117. Them were the days ... While  &UR; Peyton
Manning  &LR; did nothing but improve this season while earning the
respect of his peers, Chargers linebacker  &UR; Lew Bush &LR;  said of
hotshot  &UR; Ryan Leaf &LR; , ``He's going to have to do a lot of showing
and growing before people are going to respect him. Respect isn't
bought, it's earned. I'm not criticizing my teammate, but he did a
lot of real stupid things this season.'' Glad Bush wasn't being
critical. General manager  &UR; Bobby Beathard  &LR; doesn't disagree with
that opinion and will look to bring in a veteran who can challenge
Leaf. The most likely candidate is 36-year-old  &UR; Mark Rypien &LR; .
Beathard tried to coax Rypien out of retirement this season but
Rypien was tending to family matters that included the death of his
young son. But Rypien has alerted the Chargers and other teams that
he wants to come back ... Speaking of Beathard, how did he ever
come up with a guy who was 8-14 at Oregon State to revive the
Chargers? When  &UR; Mike Riley  &LR; was named the new San Diego coach last
week, many heads were shaking around the NFL. Riley was considered
a top offensive mind at Southern Cal, and Beathard got to know him
well. Beathard appears to be betting that Riley is the next
Mariucci. Only problem is, Riley is stuck with an immature kid in
Leaf, not someone like Young. An AFC front office rival said,
``Bobby wants to prove he can find the needle in the haystack. He
wants to keep proving he's still Bobby Beathard. The more he tries
to prove it, the farther out there he gets.'' Beathard was looking
for a younger coach with an offensive mind and may have wanted to
take a shot at Minnesota's  &UR; Brian Billick &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but he might have had
to wait until February. If he fails then, his team would be
scrambling both for a head coach and assistants when most of the
top candidates would be hired ... Even a nice guy like Rams head
coach  &UR; Dick Vermeil  &LR; got into the blame game when he chose to save
his skin by firing offensive coordinator  &UR; Jerry Rhome &LR; . Vermeil
said, ``I'm concerned about two things: No. 1, that I'm trying to
pass the buck, and No. 2 (team president)  &UR; John Shaw  &LR; told me to do
it. They're both wrong. I don't want this read as I'm blaming Jerry
Rhome for our lack of success offensively. I've spent all my time
from a technical standpoint in the offensive war room. I hired him
because I had respect for him and I still have respect for him.''
Oh, and by the way, you're fired. Why do these guys talk like this?
Two minutes later, Vermeil continued, ``This isn't all about
coaching. It's also about marketing.'' I'm sure the head coach is
more interested in that than the club's president is.

   Note to the Saints. You were much improved this season but still
finished 6-10, had 10 players arrested on charges ranging from
drunken driving to assaulting a man with a golf club, had four
lawsuits filed against you (including a $650,000 one stemming from
last summer's hazing incident), and you paid $850,000 to a guy
 &UR; Mike Ditka  &LR; hated and finally traded ( &UR; Andre Royal &LR; ), $650,000 to
a guy who failed to catch a single pass ( &UR; Qadry Ismail &LR; ), &UR;  &LR; and $1
million to  &UR; Heath Shuler  &LR; for never throwing a pass. Don't put the
new broom away quite yet ... Seventeen Falcons plus team physician
 &UR; Andrew Bishop  &LR; were at the Georgia Dome Monday night but they
couldn't save their old friend, former Falcon  &UR; Bill
Goldberg &LR; , &UR;  &LR; from destruction. The WCW's former heavyweight
wrestling champion had invited them to watch his ``title'' rematch
with new champ  &UR; Kevin Nash &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but before he got in the ring,
Goldberg was ``arrested'' on trumped-up charges filed by
 &UR; ``Hollywood'' Hulk Hogan &LR; . After Hogan ended up pinning Nash,
Goldberg ran into the ring and was beaten up and handcuffed while
Hogan, Nash, and three pals spray-painted his head. Just after this
ended, Anderson,  &UR; Cornelius Bennett &LR; , &UR; Chuck Smith &LR; , &UR; Travis
Hall &LR; , &UR; Shane Dronett &LR; , &UR; Eugene Robinson &LR; , &UR; Lester Archambeau &LR; , &UR; Dave
Widell  &LR; and other Falcons players entered the arena and chased
Goldberg's enemies out of the building before flexing and doing the
Dirty Bird dance that their 14-2 season has made popular in
Georgia. The ringleader was center  &UR; Robbie Tobeck &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a longtime
wrestling fan. Shouldn't these guys have been watching film of the
49ers or something? ... Many wondered why 58-year-old  &UR; George
Seifert  &LR; decided to risk his coaching reputation by taking over the
collapsing Carolina Panthers, but he made it clear that old
coaches, like old soldiers, never die, they just fade away. ``The
last couple of years I've kind of been living in a gray twilight,''
Seifert said after accepting a contract that will pay him an
estimated $2.5 million a season. ``It's an empty feeling. I'm more
excited than I ever thought I would be about coming back into
coaching. There is a sense and a feeling I'm at home. I'm at peace
with myself.'' Next time you hear one of these coaches complaining
about lousy press or the pressures of the job, remember those
words. They love it the way  &UR; George Patton  &LR; loved combat ...
Seifert, by the way, won 76 percent of his games (108-35) in San
Francisco and was forced out to make room for Mariucci, so let's
not hear any more nonsense about Carroll not getting a fair chance
in New England. In this day of instant gratification, you get a
chance, but nobody ever said it would be fair.

   Up in Green Bay, the hunt has begun for a head coach, and
sources there insist that former Yale running back  &UR; Dick Jauron  &LR; is
the favorite, with Rhodes (a former Packer defensive coordinator)
next. GM  &UR; Ron Wolf  &LR; likes both and has played it coy, but he did
say Thursday he had someone in mind but couldn't contact him. That
implied it was a coach in the playoffs, as Jauron is (Jacksonville
defensive coordinator), but not Rhodes, who is unemployed. Then
again, knowing Wolf, he could have meant that he'd called Rhodes
and gotten a busy signal. ``These are enormous shoes to fill, make
no mistake about it,'' Wolf said. ``You have to have the right
person to fill those shoes. This isn't going to be like one of
those high school prom things where you pick the best-looking or
the most compatible. This is a situation where you have to pick
somebody of championship caliber and championship quality, and
that's what we're going to do.'' Whoever gets the job is expected
to retain quarterbacks coach  &UR; Andy Reid &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has been designated
a supervisor by the Packers and hence can leave only for a head
job. That probably signals the end for offensive coordinator  &UR; Sherm
Lewis &LR; , who may end up back with Holmgren in Seattle ... Fox
analyst  &UR; Matt Millen  &LR; shrugged off speculation that he is in line
to become general manager of the Detroit Lions, saying, ``Just
'cause you're in the papers doesn't mean you're in a new job.''
True, but someone who was trying to negotiate a contract with the
Lions last week was told that everything is on hold because of an
expected shakeup that will remove longtime GM  &UR; Chuck Schmidt &LR; .
Millen did say he had a preliminary discussion with the Lions about
a front office job but was not specific. He has no front office or
coaching experience but played 12 years in the NFL and is the only
player to have four Super Bowl rings from three teams (Raiders,
Redskins, and 49ers) ... Here's a stat for you numbers freaks. Six
of the NFL's top eight rushing teams earned their way to the
playoffs, but the top three teams in that category _ San Francisco,
Denver, and Buffalo _ had the lightest offensive lines among
playoff clubs. Minnesota has the heaviest at an average of 322.8
pounds per man but was 11th among playoff teams in rushing. The
49ers were first in rushing (159 yards) but 11th in average weight
at 295.4 pounds. Denver was second in rushing (154.3 yards) but
last in size (287.6 pounds). The Patriots, by the way, were 27th in
the NFL in rushing but ninth in weight among playoff teams (301.6
pounds).

LEACH LATEST NEW ENGLANDER TO JOIN PHOENIX

   Steve Leach has a place in the sun, after getting what amounted
to the cold shoulder in Ottawa. The former Bruins winger from
Lexington, who earlier this season requested his release in Ottawa,
has earned a regular spot on the Phoenix Coyotes' checking line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a weird situation in Ottawa,'' said Leach, who signed
with the Senators as a free agent over the summer. ``Originally,
when we were negotiating, they didn't want to be on the hook for
the contract because I'd had neck surgery (to repair a disk). So we
agreed to a base salary, with incentives kicking in after I played
10 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine games into the season, Leach found himself out of uniform
and assigned a seat in the press box on game nights. What he hoped
would be a career kick-start turned out to be a disappointing
backfire, after moving his entire family to Ontario and getting a
house. His request for a release granted, Leach soon was headed
back to New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth,'' said the
33-year-old Leach. ``I was pretty bitter about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, Leach is yet another member of the Coyotes' growing
contingent of transplanted New Englanders. Keith Tkachuk (Medford)
and Jeremy Roenick (Marshfield) are the club's highest-profile Bay
Staters; Tkachuk is out at least another two weeks with a fractured
rib and Roenick is just back from what he figures is his sixth
concussion. Phoenix also has ex-Bruin Mike Sullivan (Duxbury), Bob
Corkum (Salisbury), Keith Carney (Providence), and Deron Quint
(Durham, N.H.).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' said Leach, who turned up in Springfield (AHL)
before joining the Coyotes. ``I guess it's a byproduct of hockey
being such a hotbed in New England, and all around Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   But there isn't necessarily strength in numbers when it comes to
fending off barbs in the dressing room about that Boston accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, you get that wherever you go _ it's like that in every
room,'' said Leach, ``especially after the summah, when you've been
hanging around your buddies a few months, it gets a little
thickah.''

   &UR; Esa Tikkanen's  &LR; never-ending revival show hit a slump on
Broadway, as he went only 0-3_3 in his first 32 games with the
Rangers. The Blueshirts shipped him Thursday to Hartford of the AHL
after scratching him for four straight games. Keep in mind:
Tikkanen signed for a base salary of $500,000, with substantial
bonuses for games on the New York roster ($200,000 at 40 games,
another $300,000 at 60 games, another $500,000 at 70 games). ``They
know what I can do,'' said Tikkanen, who was demoted after being on
the roster for 38 games. ``If they want to keep me, I'd be happy.
But sometime, I'd like to play.'' Tikkanen began the season at
 &UR; Wayne Gretzky's  &LR; left side, on the No. 1 line. The Great One now
has  &UR; Todd Harvey  &LR; and  &UR; Adam Graves  &LR; as his wingers, and head coach
 &UR; John Muckler  &LR; is using  &UR; Darren Langdon  &LR; and  &UR; Brent Fedyk  &LR; ahead of
Tikkanen ... Ex-Bruin defenseman  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld  &LR; on why we see so
few _ if any _ NHLers race over the wing and fire in 40- and
50-foot slapshots: ``The guy who comes to mind, of course, is  &UR; Guy
Lafleur &LR; . But since his time, we've had the era of the butterfly
goalies, and no one scores on a big slapshot from outside because
the whole lower half of the net is taken away. If a guy wants to
score from out there now, he's got to shoot high and try to bury it
in a corner. You're talking about a very small area, and a lot of
those shots are going to go high. When the bottom half was there,
well, you can't shoot too low _ those shots went in the net.'' ...
 &UR; Dave Reece &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the Bruins' netminder who was torched for  &UR; Darryl
Sittler's  &LR; 10 points (6 goals, 4 assists) at Maple Leaf Gardens
Feb. 7, 1976, now lives in Rhode Island and is director of
admissions at Worcester Academy. ``What can I tell you?'' said the
affable Reece, now 50. ``The folklore is I tried to commit suicide
after the game by throwing myself in front of a train, but even the
train went through my legs.'' Boston coach  &UR; Don Cherry  &LR; never gave
Reece the hook in the 11-4 shellacking. ``But you know, I didn't
want to come out,'' said Reece. ``I was always old school like
that. When it's your turn to eat the banana, you eat it _ just one
of those games. The worst thing I did _ and I never told anyone
this _ was I broke my routine the night before the game. I was
feeling kind of sorry for myself, because I found out I was being
sent back to the minors, no matter what, and I went out on the town
with Chief ( &UR; John Bucyk &LR; ) the night before. I'm not saying I got
blotto, or anything, but I didn't maintain a good regimen.'' It was
Reece's final game in the big time. He has never talked to Sittler,
who stands alone as the only NHLer to record 10 points in a game.
``It was a magic night for the guy,'' said Reece. ``Wouldn't you
think he'd send me something _ some little gift, or something, for
crying out loud. I mean, I helped put the guy in the Hall of Fame,
and he put me in the Hall of Shame.'' ... After seeing  &UR; Scott
Gomez &LR; , &UR;  &LR; their second pick (27th overall) in last June's draft,
collect 10 points in the World Junior tournament in Winnipeg, the
Devils signed the talented Alaskan center to a three-year contract
worth upwards of $2 million. Gomez went back to junior (Tri-Cities)
and is expected to report to Albany (AHL) when his season ends
there. BC's  &UR; Brian Gionta &LR; , &UR;  &LR; another Devils pick last June (82d
overall), led the tournament with 11 points ... Russia beat Canada,
3-2, in overtime to win the Junior tournament. The Oilers played
host to the Kings in Edmonton the night of the final and the crowd
was treated to the broadcast during timeouts and intermissions.
``Gee,'' said Kings defenseman  &UR; Rod Blake &LR; , &UR;  &LR; ``for a minute I
thought they might put it on the loudspeaker and let us play
through it.'' ... Yet another Bay Stater was made a team captain
last week when the Oilers tabbed  &UR; Bill Guerin  &LR; to fill in for
 &UR; Kelly Buchberger  &LR; (out at least two months with a badly broken
forearm). ``The fact the team feels I could fill in for a short
time, until Bucky's back, means a lot to me,'' said Guerin. Tkachuk
is captain in Phoenix and  &UR; Tom Fitzgerald  &LR; (Melrose) is captain in
Nashville ... Phoenix defenseman  &UR; Oleg Tverdovsky  &LR; on the success
of countryman  &UR; Sergei Samsonov &LR; : ``He's a great skater, and
personally, I thought he would have been drafted higher than he was
(No. 8 by Boston in '97). He's small, but that doesn't matter. If
you have skills and character, it doesn't matter how big you are _
I'm glad Sergei proved it.'' ... Roenick got into a scrap with
Tverdovsky at practice Wednesday, following the Coyotes' 2-2 tie
the night before with the Panthers. The confrontation escalated
from heated words to pushing, ultimately broken up by teammate  &UR; Jim
Cummins &LR; . Roenick initiated it, irate that Tverdovsky twice messed
up a practice drill. Roenick: ``I'm one of Oleg's biggest
supporters _ but we have to listen more. We have to pay attention
to detail.'' It wasn't the first time Roenick has exchanged heated
on-ice words with the talented blue liner. ``It's a game of passion
and intensity,'' said Tverdovsky. ``It's not a big deal. We've had
a few tough games, guys are on edge, and they can snap. You wish
these things don't happen, but it's sport.'' ... Former Bruin
 &UR; Terry O'Reilly &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who dabbles in real estate, purchased the
delapidated Hotel Edwards at Salisbury Beach just before the new
year. ``I heard Salisbury Beach will be making a comeback over the
next few years,'' O'Reilly told the Georgetown Record, adding that
he's not sure how he'll redevelop the groaning edifice. The deal
was closed at the Salem Registry of Deeds, with an estimated 50
title examiners clamoring for autographs.

   San Jose tough guy  &UR; Brent Myhres  &LR; has been in rehab twice to
battle a drinking problem _ a point Devils defenseman  &UR; Scott
Stevens  &LR; knew when he told him to ``go have another beer'' and also
called him a drunk after things got rough between the Devils and
Sharks at the end the second period Tuesday night. Devils
defenseman  &UR; Ken Daneyko &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who missed more than half of last season
while he battled his own alcohol addiction, empathized with Myhres.
``It's been said to me, too, but I haven't mentioned it,'' said
Daneyko. ``I brushed it off. I wouldn't recommend saying things
like that, but they're said in the heat of the battle. I wish
(Myhres) the best, he's going through the same things I'm going
through.'' Added Myhres, ``I think there's a line that shouldn't be
crossed, and I thought (Stevens) crossed it.'' ... Rangers
netminder  &UR; Mike Richter &LR; , &UR;  &LR; in a New York Times report last week,
spoke eloquently about Gretzky: ``Maturing throughout your career
is insidious. Quietly, it starts to put limitations on what you are
able to do. Wayne sees the game probably better now than ever. But
it's a cruelty of sports that when you are mentally at your peak,
you start to deteriorate physically. He has so much willpower that
he overcomes whatever level of deterioration his body has had.''
... The Minnesota Wild won't enter the NHL until October 2000 and,
if  &UR; Jay Erckenbrach  &LR; gets his way, they'll enter under a different
name. Erckenbrach, from McGregor, Minn., for a number of years has
sold jams, jellies, and wines under the ``Wild'' label, and he
feels the hockey club is using his trademark. The club's contention
is that it is selling hockey, nothing else. In an attempt to settle
the squabble, the hockey club has offered to sell Erckenbrach's
goods at home games and help him with marketing. But, so far,
Erckenbrach's not budging. If they want the game, they'll have to
buy the name ... Meanwhile, Minnesota is expected to name its
general manager in the coming weeks. Some of the rumored
contenders:  &UR; David McNab  &LR; (brother of ex-Bruin  &UR; Peter McNab &LR; ), &UR;  &LR; now
the assistant GM in Anaheim;  &UR; Les Jackson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; assistant GM in
Atlanta; and ex-Quebec GM  &UR; Pierre Page  &LR; (dismissed as Ducks coach
after last season). Ex-Minnesotan  &UR; Bobby Smith  &LR; has been rumored,
too, but his deal as Phoenix GM runs through 2001-02 ... It took
four-plus years, but the Devils last week won their Stevens
tampering charge against St. Louis, dating back to the summer of
'94. The league _ tipped by a former Blues exec _ found a dated
FedEx receipt in the files of ex-team president  &UR; Jack
Quinn &LR; , &UR;  &LR; proof that the Blues sent Stevens a four-year, $17 million
offer prior to July 1, the annual free agency date. The Blues now
must fork over $1.5 million (all but $75,000 payable to the
Devils), one first-round pick in the next five years, and also swap
a first-round pick with New Jersey on or before the June 2004
draft. So much for detailed record keeping.

NBA PLAYERS MUST FOCUS ON BLURRY IMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You already know about the NBA's six months of painful plastic
surgery. You know that the league rearranged its financial face
with its lockout, forcing hundreds of millionaires to mark
``unemployed'' on their 1998 income-tax forms.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what that means: If Michael Jordan happened to walk into
a grocery store during the past six months, he saw baggers and
cashiers making more cash from their full-time gigs than he was
making from his. Maybe the person checking MJ out on the ``12 items
or less'' line conveniently forgot to scan the eggs and Gatorade,
saving the game's best player a few dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the financial portrait from the past six months.
Certainly the players realize that, after half a year, money
matters are not the only things that have changed the way people
look at their game.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the players don't remember the way they were beginning to
be perceived, often unfairly, by league observers just before the
lockout became official July 1. Maybe they don't remember the
whispers, the public laments that many of them were disciples of
``hiphop culture,'' as if that were something to be cursed. Maybe
they don't remember their lifestyles being scrutinized and being
labeled as self-absorbed and self-destructive.
</P>
<P>
   A Connecticut woman accused Juwan Howard and Chris Webber of
sexually assaulting her in the spring. People shook their heads.
Webber was stopped on the way to practice by police, accused of
assaulting an officer and having the smell of marijuana wafting
from his vehicle. People shook their heads. Four men, three with
ties to the Celtics _ Antoine Walker, Ron Mercer, and ex-teammate
Chauncey Billups _ were accused of sexually assaulting a woman in
Waltham. People shook their heads. Sports Illustrated wrote a
6,000-word special report on NBA players fathering children with
women who weren't their wives. People shook their heads. Some of
the allegations were completely true, others were partially true,
and others were thrown out of court as lacking merit.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what. A lockout probably didn't slow the momentum of
images, images that project the NBA player as social villain.
Basketball fans will always be fans, so players probably don't have
to worry about that. But that's just for matters that relate to the
court. Off it, the image of NBA players is probably at its lowest
since the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   And here's what that means if you are a Boston Celtic: Build a
bubble, if you can. Live in it for a few weeks. People say you
cannot live your life in a bubble, but many people have never had
their personal lives under attack every day. You do. You are a
target more than you realize. Especially now. Three-fifths of your
team's projected starting lineup was not born when Richard Nixon
resigned the presidency in 1974. Well, you should know that Nixon
was paranoid. He didn't trust many people. He was always looking
over his shoulder and under his desk. Maybe you should become
Nixonian in that way for a while, especially when you go to
nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Celtics _ one of the youngest teams in NBA history,
by the way _ do not realize there are two NBAs. There is the one
that they will experience on the FleetCenter's parquet floor,
beginning Feb. 5 or 6. And then there is the one that takes place
on the nation's dance floors. You can bet that is the NBA that
keeps Celtics coach Rick Pitino awake for a few extra minutes each
night. He certainly doesn't mind having a young team, because that
means he can mold it in his likeness and compete for a title sooner
rather than later. On the court. Off it, Pitino cannot tell his
players, grown men, where they can and cannot go. That means he has
to hope they remain camouflaged against the club's walls, dance a
little, and then go home with people they know.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to ask why, you haven't been paying attention to the
sports world in the past six months. Yes, you heard about the
Sports Illustrated story and the Webber story and the Howard story.
But maybe you didn't hear that Howard and Webber were acquitted of
their sexual assault charge and that Howard wound up countersuing
for the restoration of something very important to him: his image.
Maybe you didn't hear that Howard won his countersuit for
defamation of character. Maybe you heard that Celtics star Walker
was named in a civil negligence lawsuit relative to the alleged
Waltham assault. That was originally filed late in 1997. But fewer
people paid attention when a judge dismissed the charge against
Walker, saying that he was not at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Walker and Howard were fortunate, really. The current NBA
perception is such that they easily could have been forced into
paying off a settlement even though judges ruled that they did
nothing wrong. The perception of the NBA is that bad. Walker and
Howard are also fortunate they are not in the position of Billups.
His name has not been dismissed from the assault case. So he had to
explain to his girlfriend why he is accused of having group sex
with a woman in someone else's condo. And he had to explain why he
was doing that while his girlfriend was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   We are witnessing an emerging trend in the NBA. As the images of
the players worsen, the more litigation is aimed at them. Some is
deserved, some is not. All can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   It is on days like this that I am happy not to be a pro athlete.
Sometimes, you just want to go to a club and do whatever you please
without worrying about your picture being in the paper the next
day. You can say the Celtics should be able to have that luxury,
too. They can't.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, three fliers came in the mail for Boston-area
nightclubs. The young Celtics, music and dance lovers, would
probably enjoy going. They should go. And act like Nixon.

   After a 10-point loss to Miami in late December, the Denver
Broncos tight end had said that his team was 10 to 14 points better
than the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   They passed even that Saturday in the American Football
Conference playoffs, as the Broncos dominated on both sides of the
line of scrimmage and rolled to a 38-3 victory before 75,729 at
Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The victory advances the Broncos (15-2) to the AFC title game
next Sunday against the winner of the New York Jets and
Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos scored on their first three possessions. Running
back Terrell Davis, held to 29 yards in the Broncos' loss to Miami,
rushed for 199 yards and two touchdowns in 21 carries. Leg cramps
early in the fourth quarter kept him from passing 200 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And the matchup of veteran quarterbacks _ Denver's John Elway
and Miami's Dan Marino _ went to Elway. He completed 14 of 23
passes for one touchdown and 182 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who had pierced the Denver secondary for 355 yards and
four touchdowns in the teams' last meeting, managed to complete 26
of 37 passes for 243 yards, but with no touchdowns and two
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Bill Romanowski and cornerback Darrius Johnson had
the interceptions, fulfulling strong safety Tyrone Braxton's vow
that Denver's maligned defense would be rejuvenated in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's defense even added a touchdown midway through the final
period. End Neil Smith scooped up wide receiver Oronde Gadsden's
fumble at the Miami 21 and took a couple of stutter steps, thinking
the whistle had blown. When it became apparent that it hadn't, the
6-foot-4-inch, 269-pound Smith began struggling down the field,
with only Dolphins center Tim Ruddy in serious pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Ruddy made a diving tackle attempt at the Denver 20 that failed,
and Smith finished off his 79-yard run in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   After stopping the Dolphins in three plays to open the game, the
Broncos put together one of the great textbook drives in National
Football League playoff history. There was plenty of consistency
and an occasional flash of greatness in the 14-play, 92-yard
maneuver that consumed 7 minutes 56 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The greatness came on Denver's second play, when Elway
underthrew wide receiver Rod Smith, but Smith managed to reach back
over defender Sam Madison's left shoulder to pull in a 15-yard
pass. Elway completed five of six passes in the drive for 48 yards.
His only misfire almost was _ and should have been _ caught by
Dolphins linebacker Robert Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Davis rushed seven times for 38 yards, including the
1-yard touchdown. Davis invariably attacked Miami's left side,
behind tackle Tony Jones and guard Mark Schlereth, and had gains of
13 and 11 yards as Denver effectively established the tone of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (11-7) could not muster a first down on its next series,
so the Broncos' offense picked up where it had left off. This time,
however, the Broncos practiced more clock economy by gaining yards
in huge chunks. It took them just 2:18 and four plays to move 66
yards for a 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Ed McCaffrey made a diving 33-yard reception to
get things started. Davis then gained six yards and caught a
seven-yard pass before his 20-yard scoring run. He started around
right end, then cut back and left Dolphins defenders flailing. The
last to miss, after he was faked out of position, was cornerback
Ray Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Miami then stopped the bleeding for a little while with a
76-yard drive of its own. The difference was, after reaching the
Denver two-yard line, it had to settle for a 22-yard field goal
from Olindo Mare.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with 10:07 left in the second quarter, the Dolphins
thought they were starting to get some momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos quelled those thoughts on their next possession by
going 87 yards in 11 plays. This drive took 5:28 and featured
Davis's 28-yard run, a 16-yard Elway pass to Smith. The payoff was
the twisting 11-yard run of the backup running back Derek Loville.
Loville headed right, then _ just as Davis had done on the previous
touchdown _ cut to the middle and shook off several arm tackling
attempts to burst into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   As Loville stood basking in the adulation of a partisan crowd,
an exuberant teammate playfully shoved him to the ground. Loville
bounced up and took several curtain calls.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had bitterly complained that Davis lost a fumble two
plays before Loville's score, but his ranting did no good.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime Davis had 129 yards rushing, 116 more than the
Dolphins, to go with his pair of touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   And then, on his first play of the third quarter, he rambled 62
yards to move into eighth in NFL playoff history in career rushing.

MORE TO WALKER CASE THAN MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; We now know the cost of doing business in the NBA. The Celtics
know it. Antoine Walker knows it. David Falk knows it, even if he
doesn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   It follows that there should be no reason now for the Celtics
not to re-sign Walker. Yes, the mother lode is still staggering:
Walker would be eligible to sign a seven-year extension averaging
$12.24 million per season. And the total _ $85-plus million _ is
about $60 million more than Paul Gaston has ever agreed to pay to
any player on the Celtics. (It's OK with Antoine, though.)
</P>
<P>
   But if Gaston is going to keep the Celtics competitive, those
are the numbers he is going to have to swallow _ and more than
once. Will he do it? He has to. But the phrase that kept
reverberating last Thursday when the deal was approved by the
owners was ``well-managed.'' David Stern said the deal gives teams
a chance to make money if they're ``well-managed.'' That's a
not-too-subtle message (or a shot at the Clippers), and he said it
more than once. Some owners (Micky Arison in Miami, for example)
don't care whether their team is well-managed. Gaston cares a lot.
But if he's going to compete, he will have to pay.
</P>
<P>
   But the Walker issue was never just about money. He always knew
that was going to be there; the only question was the number of
zeroes at the end of the check. The issue also is about style,
personality, and relationships. Can he and Rick Pitino coexist over
the next several years and will Walker, and others, want to keep
playing a certain style into their late 20s? Will Walker grow up
and stop being the boor that he can be on the floor, a behavior
pattern that makes him one of the league's least-liked players?
Will Pitino demand more maturity from his ``captain'' or will he
stand back as he did last year?
</P>
<P>
   Walker clearly is a wonderful talent and still a
work-in-progress. What he needed most _ a veteran to tell him when
to stop acting like a jerk _ he never got in Boston. (Frank
Brickowski wasn't around long enough.) The Celtics will have to
sign him, if for no other reason than to have him available for a
deal if it doesn't work out. Pitino thinks it will, which is
exactly what we expected him to say. Walker says he wants to stay,
which is what we expected him to say. We've learned by now,
however, that what is said and what is done aren't always the same
thing.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The NBA finally came to its senses and allowed teams to talk to
agents while the lawyers from the league and the union go over the
new agreement. It was naive to pretend that nothing was going on,
and this gives both parties a chance to examine the landscape.
Teams had been able to discuss deals among themselves; why not with
agents as well? ... The new deal will help teams like the Celtics
keep their players. It gives teams a twofold advantage in
re-signing their own free agents: a club can offer an extra year
(seven vs. six) and can offer yearly raises of 12 percent vs. 10
percent. If Walker, for instance, were to test the waters this
summer, he could field a bid of no more than $67.5 million over six
years (still enough to avoid the crowds at Kmart and Piggly
Wiggly). The Celtics can offer seven years and the aforementioned
$85-plus million. Which one would you take? ``For a team that is
building through the draft, it's a great deal,'' said MSG boss
 &UR; Dave Checketts &LR; , &UR;  &LR; one of the Nine Angry Men on the Labor Relations
Committee. ``It's excellent for the Celtics.'' He then paused and
said, ``You know, as a matter of fact, I was thinking of the
Celtics the whole time we were negotiating. I wanted to protect
them. That was my goal all along.'' He then said his next goal was
to acquire  &UR; Pervis Ellison  &LR; for  &UR; Patrick Ewing  &LR; ... Pitino said the
Celtics had had several discussions about free agency during the
lockout and not a single one dealt with a cap of $30 million. That
figure is a killer not just for Boston, but for a lot of teams. ``A
lot of teams are in a panic,'' said Nets coach  &UR; John Calipari &LR; .
``They thought they could get two guys and now they probably have
enough for only one.'' Detroit got crushed, from $10 million to
around $8 million. Orlando, for instance, has seen its cap room
fall from around $8 million to $6 million. That's still enough for
 &UR; Matt Geiger &LR; , &UR; Ike Austin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; or whomever but probably not enough
for two decent players. The Celtics have no options unless they can
unload salaries, a difficult task given their largely unappealing
roster. Their best bet would be to re-sign  &UR; Popeye Jones  &LR; and live
with what they have in the middle ... If you were a major sponsor
of Indiana Pacers basketball, last week was your basic win-win. Not
only did you see the season saved (not to mention a possible title
for your Pacers) but you also could toast the settlement in Cancun.
That's where the Pacers took their VIS (Very Important Sponsors)
... We hear that the owner of the San Antonio Spurs,  &UR; Peter Holt &LR; ,
is less than enthused about bringing in Mr. Warmth,  &UR; Latrell
Sprewell &LR; . The odds still favor Miami, but the base-year
compensation rules may hurt any deal because the Warriors want
 &UR; Brent Barry  &LR; included. The same goes in discussions with Indiana
( &UR; Travis Best  &LR; would be a base-year guy) and New York ( &UR; Charlie
Ward &LR; ) ... Checketts is concerned that Ewing is not in shape as the
season approaches. ``Did you see him in Atlantic City? It wasn't
pretty,'' Checketts said. ``He needs now to focus on basketball. I
told him that. I told him his concern is the Knicks, not the union.
I would have rather seen someone else at the bargaining table, like
maybe  &UR; Reggie Miller &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but it was Patrick.'' Ewing, remember,
missed most of last year with a wrist injury and then spent the
last several months acting as president of the union. Checketts
said he was convinced last Monday that the season would be over.
``The owners were tight. I was wondering what we were going to do
with all those empty nights,'' he said. ``But I think what happened
is that  &UR; Billy  &LR; ( &UR; Hunter &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; figured he had come too far, too long,
and that he'd better get an agreement for those guys who were
coming into town. So his executive committee told him, `Go make a
deal.''' It could have been ugly had those players not had an
agreement on which to vote. ``I was expecting an eventful day,''
 &UR; Danny Ferry  &LR; said. ``I don't know what would have happened if we
did not have something to vote on.'' ... We won't know for a while
whether the fans will come back _ all bullet polls indicate they
still don't care _ but it would be misleading to base anything on
the dog-and-pony show last week at the GM Building. Yes, there were
fans and autograph-seekers, but it was a celebrity-spotting thing.
Most people didn't even know whose autograph they were getting, and
no one had to pay a nickel for the privilege ... Aside to Coach
Pitino: The six-month labor impasse was a lockout, imposed by
ownership, not a strike.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chris Ford  &LR; got a call Thursday from Clippers GM  &UR; Elgin Baylor
 &LR; and was told that the team hoped to have its coaching situation
``wrapped up'' by Monday. Ford and Clipper assistant  &UR; Jim Brewer
 &LR; are presumed to be the two leading candidates. Brewer would come
cheaper, which is always a big consideration with the Clippers.
Ford is interested in the job, although his wife and kids will stay
in Lynnfield for the rest of the season if he gets the nod. By the
way, Ford's daughter  &UR; Katie  &LR; was chosen All-New England in
volleyball from that noted Division 3 juggernaut, Williams College.
And  &UR; Chris Jr. &LR;  has graduated from college and is coaching an
eighth-grade team in southern New Jersey. He's also substitute
teaching ... Calipari is eager to get back to work, but said those
who thought he was ``going nuts'' were misinformed. He said the
down time was a real benefit. ``The last two years, I've been beat
up quite a bit,'' he said. ``It was physically grueling; I wasn't
used to the long season or the intense scrutiny or the number of
games. The lockout was good for me that I got away from that for
awhile.'' Cal has decisions to make Sunday on two players, one of
them believed to be  &UR; Michael Cage &LR; . Their contracts have guarantees
that kick in Sunday ... Agent  &UR; Marc Fleisher &LR; , no fan of the new
Collective Bargaining Agreement, thinks European players won't want
to be first-round picks because of the five-year commitment they
must give to their NBA team. ``They're better off being
second-rounders who can cut their own deals,'' he said. ``The money
allotted for first-rounders won't be enough. They can make more in
Europe.'' As usual, Fleisher has a couple of obscure (by NBA
standards, anyway) clients who may make NBA rosters this season.
One is  &UR; Oded Kattash &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who, Fleisher says, is ``the  &UR; Michael
Jordan  &LR; of Israel'' and plays for Maccabi-Tel Aviv. The Knicks are
interested in him and the Clippers and Pistons both wanted to sign
Kattash before the lockout. Indiana has some interest in 7-foot
Croatian  &UR; Mate Skelin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; another Fleisher client.  &UR; Steve
Kauffman &LR; , &UR;  &LR; meanwhile, thinks he has another  &UR; Bruce Bowen &LR;  type in
Pepperdine's  &UR; Gerald Brown &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was undrafted. He played very
well in an agent's summer league in LA and could wind up in either
Phoenix or Indiana ... Utah owner  &UR; Larry Miller &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a man of the
people dressed in a sports shirt and sneakers for the Board of
Governors meeting, wonders how hoop historians will judge this
season. ``I think there might be an asterisk on this season,'' he
said. ``I think 50 games gives us some credibility, but it's not a
full-blown, 82-game season. You can't say that. Then again, I might
feel differently on June 29.'' Miller is fuming over reports that
he has a handshake deal with  &UR; Karl Malone  &LR; for a new contract.
``I'll say, diplomatically, that I'm frustrated by that,'' he said.
``It distresses me greatly. There is no handshake or deal. We have
never talked about a new contract, other than Karl saying he wants
to keep playing, he wants to keep playing in Utah, and he wants to
make a lot of money. I feel betrayed by whoever said that.'' Miller
also said he was stung by Malone's comments during the lockout that
he had played his last game as a member of the Jazz and wanted to
be traded. ``It really hurt,'' Miller said. ``Our relationship is
not a facade. We have gotten close over the years. When I hear that
stuff, I wonder where it's coming from. I don't presume to know.
The fact that I couldn't talk to him was frustrating for me. But
he's also got to be cognizant of the damage he's done, in terms of
sponsorships and things like that. No one's going to want a guy
who's all over the map.''

COWBOYS HOPE TO DUMP SALARIES, ADD TALENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A ``sickening feeling and bitter taste'' remain
at the Cowboys' Valley Ranch training complex more than a week
after the shocking wild-card playoff loss to the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   If Cowboys coach Chan Gailey has his way, the stench will
linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to remember what this tastes like,'' Gailey said. ``It
will give us a spur to take it further next year. We don't want to
sit in the same spot. We've got to build on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Eternally optimistic Cowboys owner Jerry Jones remains hopeful
of rebuilding a solid playoff contender largely because of the
changes made last season. Gailey will be in his second season as
head coach, and the players will be further along in their
adjustment to Gailey's offense and the altered defensive scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see in Chan Gailey is a man who can make the changes to
make us champions again,'' Jones said. ``I see a very good plan. I
like the direction we are going here.''
</P>
<P>
   Crucial to the plan, however, is upgrading the team's talent.
Jones said he always believed players, not coaches, were the key to
championship teams. It's no secret the Cowboys' fall from grace _
after winning three Super Bowl titles from 1992 through 1995 _ can
be blamed on a drop in talent.
</P>
<P>
   Since their Super Bowl season of 1992, the Cowboys have lost 46
players, including 10 starters. During that span, the Cowboys have
added only seven players via free agency and only four of those
became starters: cornerback Deion Sanders, center Ray Donaldson,
linebacker Fred Strickland and guard Everett McIver. Donaldson is
no longer with the team and Strickland is on his way out.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys compounded their problems with draft mistakes. One
player (Larry Allen) out of the 45 players picked in the past four
drafts has developed into a Pro Bowl performer. Only three players
remain from the 1994 and 1995 drafts combined.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Jones says this off-season is crucial to the team's
future. He said the Cowboys have a great opportunity to enhance
their personnel _ from the outside through the draft and free
agency and from within through expected improvement by several
younger players: guard Flozell Adams, tight end David LaFleur and
defensive end Greg Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card in the equation is the Cleveland Browns' expansion
draft, which might allow the financially strapped Cowboys to unload
some big salaries and clear salary-cap room.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, Gailey and the Cowboys' scouts have been huddling all
week working on list of five players they will expose to the Feb. 9
expansion draft by Tuesday's deadline. The Browns will inherit the
cap impact of any bonus paid to the players they select.
</P>
<P>
   With 43 players already under contract for 1999 at a cost of
roughly $61 million, Jones will try to use the expansion draft to
ease the salary cap burden. The 1999 cap is expected to be $57.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way the expansion draft helps is easing the cap,''
Jones said. ``This is the only time you can make a move with a
player with a big cap number.''
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list of potential cost-cutting targets is cornerback
Kevin Smith, who lost his starting job to Kevin Mathis and will
count $3.334 million against the salary cap next season. Other
possibilities and how much they will count against the cap are
tight end Eric Bjornson ($859,000), Strickland ($1.117 million),
defensive tackle Hurvin McCormack ($750,000), cornerback Charlie
Williams ($600,000) and receiver Billy Davis ($1.13 million). All
are candidates to be released if they're not selected in the
expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Long shots for the draft list are defensive tackle Chad Hennings
($1.486 million) and fullback Daryl Johnston ($1.65 million). Both
are solid citizens and good for the team; however, neither player's
output matches his salary.
</P>
<P>
   As for the history of poor personnel moves, Jones says he is
encouraged about the choices the Cowboys will make because of the
people who will make them. A couple of years ago, the Cowboys moved
from a coaches-directed selection process to one headed by the
scouting department and chief scout Larry Lacewell.
</P>
<P>
   The move has resulted in two solid, if not spectacular, drafts.
Six picks remain on the team from the 1997 draft, including two
starters. Seven players, including two starters, remain from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts still have a dominant influence over player personnel,
and Gailey is expected to have a lot of input in deciding who's on
the team next season.

PETERS PERSONIFIES BEST ASPECTS OF GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having been introduced as the Massachusetts Golf Association's
Player of the Year, Justin Peters put a gentle embrace on a trophy
and a serious dose of humility on the proceedings Thursday night.
The 21-year-old from Pembroke was being honored for his athletic
talent, but he showed that it was great character that had really
brought him to this evening.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out at a crowd of several hundred at Wellesley Country
Club, Peters singled out his mother, Rosemarie, and showered her
with praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's incredible,'' said Peters. ``Every day I try and be a
little more like her.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who know Justin Peters who will tell you that he
is succeeding, that indeed Rosemarie's goodness and strength have
been inherited by her son. Dick Haskell, for one, will vouch for
that.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell is just a year retired from his post as executive
director of the MGA, and in nearly three decades in that job he saw
a lot of great golf and thousands of rounds of competition. He is
not easily impressed and he holds fast to some aspects of the game
that many may consider old-fashioned and corny; things like
behavior and etiquette, respect and honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were talking about a doctor, you would say bedside
manners,'' said Haskell, for whom the Player of the Year award is
named. ``Justin Peters has great on-course manners.''
</P>
<P>
   His summer included a victory at the prestigious Hornblower
Memorial and a fifth-place finish in the State Open, in addition to
another solid run at the US Public Links Championship and a high
finish in the Ouimet Memorial. It also included the death of his
father, John, at a time when the two were reestablishing some
semblance of a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   His parents had divorced when he was 14 and for years Justin
heard not a word from his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was never there for me,'' said Justin. ``He was struggling
in his life, drinking, and had problems he had to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Rosemarie was the center of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always Mom taking me to baseball games, soccer games,
whatever,'' he said. ``Then golf. She was the reason I got to play
in all those tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   John Peters reentered the picture a few years ago, though it
``was off and on,'' said Justin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was hope, and a Christmas meeting in Boston a year
ago was enjoyable. Another get-together was held early last summer
and a short while later John Peters called his son and talked about
spending a weekend on the Cape. A few days later, John Peters was
found dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bought me my first set of clubs when I was 13,'' said
Justin. ``I said, `What are these?' I had no idea. But he got me
introduced to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a game he has grown to love, no small reason being that he
has been able to share it with his mother. Last summer, Peters was
playing in the New England Amateur at New Haven CC in Connecticut
and on the morning of the 36-hole finale, Rosemarie had an idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came up to me and said, `Why don't I caddie for you?'''
said Peters. ``I couldn't believe it, but she did. What a trooper.
I didn't play that well, but I'll treasure that memory forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that Peters has pro aspirations, he found the
timing to be perfect Thursday night because the guest speaker was
 &UR; Geoff Sisk &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the popular Marshfield golfer who leaves for Hawaii
Sunday as he embarks on his rookie season on the PGA Tour. It's a
dream come true for the 32-year-old Sisk, a two-time State Open and
New England Open champion who finished tied for fourth at
Qualifying School in December to secure his 1999 Tour card.
</P>
<P>
   Sisk and Peters were the last two to leave Wellesley CC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to talk to him, to pick his brain,'' said Peters.
``He was great. He gave me his phone number and told me to call
anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters will soon return to the University of Nevada-Reno, where
he is a senior and star of the golf team. He is behind in credits
so he'll stay out there this summer, take classes, then finish up
next fall. The good news: He is determined to get his degree. The
bad news (though perhaps not for the competition): Peters will miss
next summer's state competition that has played such a huge part in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Sisk, meanwhile, is a mixed bag of emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled but I'm nervous,'' he said. ``I've never played
before 40,000 people before. But a friend told me that the size of
the hole hasn't changed, so we'll just do the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   His early schedule calls for the Sony Open in Hawaii, the Bob
Hope Chrysler Classic, possibly Phoenix, then the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am. It is just the start of a journey, said Sisk, that
he figures will mean $70,000-$90,000 in travel expenses, an
overwhelming figure to be sure, but he is, after all, chasing a
dream that involves millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' he joked to a crowd that included his wife,
Denise. ``Maybe in a few years we can retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he have the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the best of feelings going into Tour School and
I shot 20 under,'' said Sisk. ``How did I do it? I don't know. If I
did, I would do it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Also honored Thursday night were  &UR; Ed Fletcher &LR; , &UR;  &LR; senior player
of the year;  &UR; Kenny Lewis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; junior player of the year;  &UR; Laura
Torrisi &LR; , &UR;  &LR; player of the year in the Women's Golf Association of
Massachusetts;  &UR; Tracy Welch &LR; , &UR;  &LR; WGAM Association champion; and
winners of the major MGA events.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Mercedes Championship, which kicks off the 1999 PGA Tour
schedule and concludes this evening in Hawaii, is a select-field
event with one simple criterion for entry: You must have won a
tournament the previous year. That would seem to make it a
can't-miss date, but five eligible players did not take advantage,
for various reasons.  &UR; Olin Browne &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who won the Greater Hartford
Open, is recovering from arm surgery, and  &UR; Hal Sutton  &LR; (Tour
Championship) stayed home with his wife, who is expecting twins.
Understandable absences on both counts. But the fact that three
others ( &UR; Nick Price &LR; , &UR; Lee Westwood &LR; , &UR; Ernie Els &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; were no-shows
underscores just how much money is out there for elite players:
They shrugged off a $2.6 million purse. Their schedules were full,
and they will have ample opportunities in the coming months to play
for purses twice that size ... File this under Long Story Made
Short.  &UR; Hank Kuehne &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the reigning US Amateur champ who could
leave  &UR; Tiger Woods  &LR; and  &UR; John Daly  &LR; fighting for second place in a
three-way driving contest, showed a soft side to his game at a
recent visit to Augusta National. Kuehne made seven birdies and
shot 20 on the par-3 course, then told a reporter he felt he should
have shot 18. The senior at Southern Methodist will be in the
Masters field in April, and it's even money that one of the first
story lines that week will be Kuehne's enormous length off the tee,
particularly if he plays a practice round with Woods, which is
almost a certainty ... Speaking of Woods, he will gladly relinquish
(at least for 1999) his place as the most sought-after interview in
golf. For now, it belongs to  &UR; Ben Crenshaw &LR; , &UR;  &LR; thanks to his status
as US Ryder Cup captain. Crenshaw's schedule is punctuated by press
conferences that will do wonders for his frequent-flier program:
Feb. 17 in Los Angeles, March 3 in Miami, May 19 in Fort Worth,
June 28 in New York, and June 30 and Aug. 11 in Chicago. Not to
mention all the other ones that will pop up along the way,
including a stop in Boston March 11, when he will be presented the
third annual Francis Ouimet Award for Lifelong Contributions to
Golf at the Ouimet Scholarship Fund's 50th anniversary celebration.
(Tickets for that event are available. Call 781-891-6400 for
information.) Crenshaw hopes to be able to celebrate a quiet 47th
birthday Monday with his wife and three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   His return to the professional golf battles has been delayed a
few more weeks, but  &UR; Pat Burke  &LR; can take solace in the fact that a
doctor finally located the source of his pain. Burke finished 79th
on the money list in 1996, then started experiencing hand problems
the next season and watched as his exempt status slipped away. He
was able to play in just one Tour event and four Nike stops last
year, all the while trying to shake off the nagging pain. Then,
just two weeks before the second stage of Tour Qualifying in
November, Burke was told by a doctor that surgery would be needed
to clean out bone spurs in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, 36, made it through the second stage, securing his Nike
card for 1999, but missed by two shots at the final stage in a bid
to return to the PGA Tour, on which he played from 1992-97.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get a job first, then have the surgery,'' said
Burke, explaining why he put off the operation until Dec. 10. ``I
had been running around in circles for 16 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke will play the Nike Tour this year, though he probably
won't enter an event until March. The layoff is frustrating, said
Burke, and while his game may be his rusty, his refreshing humor
and honesty are as sharp as ever. He supports the controversial
plan to form a players association, though he warns against waging
a ``confrontational'' campaign against the PGA Tour, and he
subscribes to the theory (as do a lot of people) that the new World
Golf Championships is not necessarily a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Burke paints a picture that is very real, of the elite players
concentrating on the WGC events (three this year, four per year
beginning in 2000), the four majors, then those tournaments that
are just a notch below the majors, i.e. the TPC, the Colonial, the
Memorial. By then a player would probably have come close to the
minimum of 15 events, and thus be more apt to lean toward worldwide
events with mega-purses (and appearance fees) such as the Loch
Lomond in Scotland, the Holden Classic in Australia, and those in
Japan (Bridgestone, Phoenix Dunlap). All of which leads to the
obvious conclusion: Many traditional Tour stops could face a
shortage of name players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what happened at Pleasant Valley,'' said Burke. ``That
was a tournament for us, for the guys fighting to make a living,
not for the stars. It was like the Tour said, `Thanks for putting
up your own money all those years. Now we're taking the event away
from you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Which is how the organizers in Tucson must feel. A staple on
Tour for 54 years, the Tucson Open (now the Touchstone Energy
Tucson Open) gets second-class treatment in 1999, thrown up against
the first of the WGC events, the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship in late February. Tournament organizers still had to
come up with millions for a purse, and for that they get a TV date
with CNBC without any shot at the world's best players.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Casey Martin  &LR; was recently voted winner of the Ben Hogan Award,
given annually by the Golf Writers Association of America to a
golfer who overcomes physical handicaps or illness. A year ago,
Martin was a focal point as he took the PGA Tour to court in an
effort to use a cart in competition. Born with a circulatory
disease in his right leg, Martin cannot walk without great pain,
and the case drew widespread debate, with the PGA Tour taking a
public relations beating. A year later, Martin is back for his
second try on the Nike Tour (he birdied the last hole Friday to
make the cut in this week's season opener, shooting 75-71) and he's
got to be glad that the spotlight has dimmed ... Not a good start
to the Nike campaign for local notables  &UR; Fran Quinn  &LR; of
Northborough (78-70),  &UR; Kevin Johnson  &LR; of Pembroke (74-73), and
 &UR; Jamie Neher  &LR; of Weston (70-80), all of whom missed the cut in
Pompano Beach, Fla. ...  &UR; Rodney Butcher &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the State Open winner,
was one champion unable to attend Thursday's MGA event, as he is
playing in the Panama Open ... Forms are available at Ponkapoag GC
in Canton for junior golfers interested in passes for the upcoming
season. Only 250 junior passes will be issued, on a first-come,
first-served basis. Call  &UR; Dave Folan  &LR; at 781-828-4242 for
information ... It was a summer victory with a memorable winter
payoff for a local foursome:  &UR; Jim McDermott  &LR; and  &UR; Sharon McDermott
 &LR; of Watertown, and  &UR; J.D. Smeallie  &LR; and  &UR; William Machen  &LR; of Boston.
They will be teeing it up at Pebble Beach this week in the Cadillac
Invitational National Finals to benefit the National Kidney
Foundation. The group finished first at a regional event in August
at Ledgemont CC in Seekonk.

HITCHCOCK'S HAPPINESS NO MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. _ Outside, it was snowing, and the
mid-afternoon temperature was zero, give or take a few degrees. The
Vikings' practice field was covered with snow, a small drift here
or there. The replica of the original Vikings' Scandinavian skiff
outside the practice facility was locked in a snowbank, going
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Too cold.
</P>
<P>
   But inside, the smile on Jimmy Hitchcock's face was wide and
warm. The warmth virtually radiated from the former Patriot, so
happy to be with the 15-1 Vikings ``and to be on a team that really
wants me.'' It was only when Hitchcock thought back to last spring
in New England and talked of the trauma of Draft Day that the chill
could be felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crushed,'' said Hitchcock of the moment he learned the
Patriots had traded him to Minnesota. ``Anytime you're in a
situation where people say, `We don't want you anymore,' and,
`You're not good enough to be here,' it's a crushing blow. More to
my ego than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Jimmy Hitchcock's ego. Seldom has any ego in professional
football been as battered and bruised as that of Jimmy Hitchcock.
Only if Job himself had played football would any individual
seemingly be tested as much as Hitchcock was tested.
</P>
<P>
   First, Bill Parcells rode him relentlessly; then opposing
quarterbacks seemingly threw every pass toward the right side of
the Patriots' defense, Hitchcock's side; next Parcells benched
Hitchcock, virtually giving up on the young cornerback, not even
letting him feel he had been part of the team in the moments before
the Super Bowl game against Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that was hard on me,'' said Hitchcock. ``But it just made
me stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock survived when Parcells gave up on him, but soon Bobby
Grier gave up on him, too, taking Chris Canty as New England's
first pick in 1997 to replace Hitchcock. Hitchcock survived that,
also. But last April, Grier gave up on Hitchcock a second time, and
Pete Carroll concurred. After seeing Tebucky Jones in drills, Grier
and Carroll decidedthat Hitchcock could go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how I found out about it?'' asked Hitchcock. ``The
media. I found out about it over the television. That's how I found
out I'd been traded. Pete Carroll never told me to my face.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hitchcock, Carroll told him, ``There's no way I'll
trade you,'' and, ``There's no way I'd let you go, because you're a
coachable guy and you had a good year. Why would I let you go?
You're a coach-able guy and you do what I ask you to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, said Hitchcock, didn't keep his word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate it that it came to me that way,'' said Hitchcock. ``I
wish he had told me the truth. Like Coach Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know me and Coach Parcells had problems, but Coach Parcells
told me the truth. And when I found out on Draft Day I'd been
traded over the television, I began to have more respect for Coach
Parcells. At least he told me the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hitchcock trade seemed odd, no matter how promising Jones
had been in his workouts before the draft. The Patriots' defense
was strong and cohesive at the end of the 1997 season, and
Hitchcock was getting better and better each year. Clearly, Canty
was much more of a liability than Hitchcock, but Canty had a
protective shield around him: He was the first choice after the
Parcells-Bob Kraft divorce the previous year; so Canty had to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots fans know the result of that thinking. Hitchcock's old
corner position was a sore spot all season, as Canty was not up to
the job and Steve Israel was not healthy enough to play until late
October. Jones, the promising rookie, was relegated to special
teams for much of the season. The reverberations from Hitchcock's
departure were felt all the way down to the Patriots' nickel and
dime pass defenses, which were abysmal on third downs. The talent
had been thinned by Hitchcock's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed them closely because those guys there are my
friends, and my heart was there to see how they would do,'' said
Hitchcock. ``I always wanted the guys to do well, but you kind of
want the organization not to do well. It was kind of a love-hate
thing, but I followed them closely. I just kept thinking that,
well, maybe I could have been a positive factor. Maybe the seven
interceptions I had (with the Vikings) and the three touchdowns (on
returns), maybe they would have helped them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock talked regularly with New England receiver Troy Brown,
a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be talking to Troy about his injury and about how things
were going on the team, and I knew they were going to struggle,''
said Hitchcock. ``Giving up Curtis Martin, myself, and Sam Gash,
and Keith Byars going ... these guys were the heart of the team,
the soul of the team. Not only could these guys play, but the moral
conviction they brought and the role models they were ... you can't
lose that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock and Martin were close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curtis had such an effect on me,'' said Hitchcock of the
intangibles that sometimes meld a football team. ``Every day I'd
see Curtis go home right after practice and I'd see that and I'd
say, `Maybe I should go home.' You know what I'm saying. That's
very, very, very important to have that on a team. We have that on
this team with leaders such as Cris (Carter), but the Patriots had
that, too. And they let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock observed other things about the Patriots' season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know why (safety) Willie Clay slipped this year?'' said
Hitchcock. ``It was because he had to help out and look out for the
guys they had at corner and he couldn't just do his job. Really,
the Patriots lost two guys from the (defensive backfield) when they
let me go _ me and Willie Clay.''
</P>
<P>
   The wounds are still open even though Hitchcock is far from New
England. The Vikings just may be the best team in football,
Hitchcock has had a superlative year, and coach Dennis Green
``wants me on the team,'' said Hitchcock. ``That's a great feeling,
to be wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Lord put me all through that for a reason, and now
I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock smiled warmly enough to melt the ice in Minnesota in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the call
</P>
<P>
   Both the Jets and Vikings had bye weeks for the first round, and
so it was natural that Hitchcock and Martin would be together.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock chuckled at the memory of his trip to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Curtis is The Man in New York,'' he said. ``People don't
know this about Curtis, because he doesn't show it publicly, but
Curtis has always wanted to be a superstar. I mean, undercover kind
of like, being Curtis and all. It's tough to do, wanting to be a
superstar and being modest, but Curtis has always wanted that. And
now he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the two pals talked much about the Patriots. They
reminded each other of what they talked about after the Patriots
lost to Pittsburgh in the playoffs a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remembered how we'd speculated about what was going to
happen,'' said Hitchcock. ``Curtis said, `I wonder if Bill comes to
get me; I'd love to play for Bill. And I'd love to go down there to
New York City and that'd be a great thing.' And I was like, `Man, I
don't even know what my situation is going to be.' I said,
`Hopefully, things will work out where I can come back and be
productive.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Hitchcock went on, ``Curtis got picked up by Bill and I
was kind of left out in limbo and Curtis and me'd be talking a lot
then. And I said to him, `Curtis, let's pray to God that I'm out of
here, because the best thing for me would be to go where I'm
wanted. They don't want me in New England and I can tell.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock talked of how he knew from the exhibition game in
Foxborough when the Vikings shut out the Patriots that his new team
was very good and his old team was slipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what that game in Foxborough reminded me of?'' he
said. ``Remember the time in our Super Bowl year when we went down
to Dallas for an exhibition game and we killed the Cowboys?
Something like 34-14? And I remember walking off the field and
(Parcells) was saying, `Either we're very good or the Cowboys are
on the downslide.' Well, both were true. And that's exactly what I
was thinking when I walked off the field in Foxborough when we beat
the Patriots: `Man, we're good and maybe they're not so good
anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock talked of his Vikings, of how their defense receives
little attention because the offense scores so many points, ``but
we're good. And we're going to show it in these playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked of going against Randy Moss each day in practice, and
he marveled at Minnesota's rookie receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you,'' said Hitchcock, ``Moss is the best receiver
I've ever seen, maybe the best ever. In a lot of ways, Terry Glenn
has a lot of talent like Randy does, but you want to know the
difference? Randy just loves the game; he just loves to play
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock was prodded into saying what is deep in his thoughts
as his team prepares to take on Arizona this afternoon. His dream,
he acknowledges, is to get back to the Super Bowl, this time with a
uniform on, this time ``playing for a coach who wants me'' and this
time making the plays that will beat the other team.
</P>
<P>
   For the true poetry of justice, the ``other team,'' of course,
would be the New York Jets. Coached by Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   One of many supposedly wise football people who were wrong about
Jimmy Hitchcock.

SIDELINE VIEWS OF THE GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A look at Sunday's playoff games, through the eyes of experts.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville at New York, as assessed by Joe Pendry, offensive
coordinator of the Buffalo Bills: ``The Jets do a wonderful job
every week getting their players in position to make plays, on both
offense and defense. Jacksonville will want to run Fred Taylor and
get the ball to their speed on the outside, (Jimmy) Smith and
(Keenan) McCardell. The Jets know this and will come with three or
four defensive packages, and all of them will be designed not to
give up the big play. The Jets' defense is just not going to give
you the big play. They always have that covered on the pass or run.
They do a good job getting their safe-tyman into position to take
away the deep ball, and protecting their corners, and coming up to
play the run. Jacksonville likes to move their defensive players
around, shift just before the snap of the ball, give you a lot of
defensive looks, trying to create confusion. They blitz more than
the Jets, and they play a lot of zone dogs against both the run and
the pass. Jacksonville has sound schemes on both sides of the ball.
All coaches are copycats, and these are two teams I look at a lot
to see what they are doing, because they come up with so many good
ideas. When we played in New York this year, the noise was very
difficult to handle. And I think that Jets crowd will be even more
pumped up because this is a playoff game, and give the Jets a big
edge. Jacksonville must do a good job with the snap count, getting
off on the right count and not playing back on their heels because
they are not sure of the count.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona at Minnesota, assessed by Cowboys head coach Chan
Gailey: ``We played Minnesota, scored 36 points, Troy (Aikman)
threw for over 400 yards, and we still got beat. The Vikings have
tremendous firepower on offense, the best in the league. Look at
the way they can score points. They've got great weapons, but what
they do starts with the offensive line. They are probably the best
in the league. They've got a bunch of No. 1s in that group. Then
you've got (Randall) Cunningham having a great year; (Randy) Moss,
(Cris) Carter, (Jake) Reed coming back, Robert Smith, (Leroy)
Hoard, and a good tight end (Andrew Glover). We tried all kinds of
different things on defense to slow them down and we couldn't.
Randy Moss had three big plays for touchdowns against us. That will
be an interesting matchup, Moss against Aeneas Williams. That will
be a real good one, but Williams is giving up 4 or 5 inches in
height. How good Arizona does will depend on Jake (Plummer). When
he is up, they play good. When he is down, they don't. He's a
big-play maker, and he'll have to be in this game. I think
Arizona's big hope is to keep it close, and then let Jake win it at
the end like he has done in so many games this year. It's going to
be hard to beat Minnesota up there with that team, the crowd noise,
playing in a dome.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Giunta, defensive coordinator of the St. Louis Rams (who
is from Salem via St. John's Prep, by the way), on the
Minnesota-Arizona matchup: ``The best way to stop the Vikings'
offense is with your own offense. Arizona must control the clock
and move the ball. Time of possession is critical. You want to hold
the ball as long as you can because they are so explosive. Adrian
Murrell must have a good day running, and I think you will see Jake
Plummer bootleg a lot and try to run for some first downs. I was
with Randall for four years in Philadelphia. He is much more mature
now as a quarterback. You can see he is really focused on what he
is doing. In Philly, he seemed to be distracted. He is more patient
than ever. In our game, the score was 31-31 late in the game, and
we blitzed Todd Lyght off the corner. He came clean. Randall saw
him coming and still held the ball. Todd splattered him. But
Randall threw it for a touchdown to Cris Carter. In his Philly days
that would not have happened. He'd have seen Todd coming and
started to run himself to make a play. He's playing great football
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kuharich, general manager of the New Orleans Saints,
seconds what Giunta had to offer: ``Clearly, you have to keep the
Minnesota offense off the field. They can score from any place on
the field at any time on any play with a bunch of different guys.
With all of their great offensive weapons, they spread you out,
create mismatches, and go to work on your weakness. We held Moss to
one catch for 6 yards. We shut down the other big guys. So they
beat us by throwing nine completions to Glover, the tight end. We
had to cover him with a linebacker in our scheme, so they kept on
throwing to him in the seams and he made the catches. But we kept
them from the big play, and that kept us in the game. It was 24-24
with six minutes to play. If Arizona is to win, they have to do it
with great special teams play and a big day running from Murrell.
The Vikings are not that great against the run. That's how Tampa
beat them, running for 240 yards. Arizona will have to be patient
and slow down the pace of the game. They should try to limit the
number of chances Minnesota's offense gets with the ball in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   I asked one NFL playoff coach what the chances were of a game
official making a call in favor of the visiting team in a crucial
situation late in the game. ``Five percent,'' he said. ``I'd say
it's 95-5 in favor of the home team if it's a call that could go
either way.'' I think that's high; 1 percent of officials might
have the courage to face 80,000 screaming fans and make the call
for the visitors, and I think that is the No. 1 reason to bring
back instant replay. Replay would overturn the calls that on-field
officials do not want to make. Let's take a look at some of the
most controversial calls this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the Buffalo-at-New England game, two calls go in favor of the
Patriots on their home field in the closing seconds to give them a
victory. The loss costs Buffalo home-field advantage in playoffs.
In the first round, Buffalo goes to Miami, where three critical
calls in the fourth period go against the Bills, including a
15-yard penalty at the Miami 1, which results in Andre Reed being
thrown out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the Seattle-at-New York game, Vinny Testaverde's quarterback
sneak comes up short of the goal line, but officials give the home
team the call, and the win helps the Jets to the AFC East title.
The loss knocks Seattle out of the playoff picture, and probably
costs Dennis Erickson his job.
</P>
<P>
   In the Green Bay-at-San Francisco playoff game, Jerry Rice
fumbles in the final minute, but officials give the ball back to
San Francisco, which wins with three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the season, the NFL office apologized for officials
making two calls that cost the Colts a victory in San Francisco.
Again, the home team got the edge. Remember the coin toss in
Detroit on Thanksgiving? The Steelers get robbed. The Lions got the
ball in overtime, and won on a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Something has to be done. Replay certainly could help.

PLUMMER NEEDS HELPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The thermometer had plummeted to 17 degrees below
zero on the day the Arizona Cardinals arrived from the desert. Yet
it was the Minnesota heat the Cardinals most feared _ the heat from
the NFL's best offense.
</P>
<P>
   The refreshing, resurgent, and upstart Cardinals will meet the
15-1 Vikings this afternoon in an NFC semifinal at the Metrodome
(always 72 degrees, no matter the wind chill outside).
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Vikings are monstrous favorites, this game still
should be a treat _ at least for a while _ for true football fans,
because of the Flutiesque quarterback of the Cardinals, Jake
Plummer, who in only his second season has moved toward earning
that rare distinction for NFL QBs _ ``winner'' _ and because of the
spunk of the Cardinals, who are 7-1 this season in games decided by
3 points or fewer, the best such record in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   And the Vikings, of course, feature the terrifying threat of
three exceptional wide receivers, Cris Carter, Jake Reed, and Randy
Moss.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the game will not be a treat for one individual _ Dave
McGinnis, the defensive coordinator of the Cardinals. Even before
drafting Moss, the brilliant rookie, Minnesota generally was
regarded as having the best pair of wide receivers in the league.
With Moss, the Vikings might have the most dangerous passing game
in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition of Randy made such a difference,'' said Carter,
the wise and talented leader of the Vikings' offense. ``In the last
few years, we had gotten to the point where we wanted to do some
things on offense but we couldn't do them. But Randy is such a
phenomenal player that he gives us the option of doing a lot of
things that we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is that ``we want to score points,'' said Carter,
``and we know we're going to score them.''
</P>
<P>
   The burden of stopping this awesome scoring machine will be on
McGinnis and, to a point, Aeneas Williams, the superb cornerback of
the Cardinals. But even on his best days, Williams has been known
to cover only one receiver, not three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aeneas is kind of unorthodox,'' said Carter. ``Aeneas is very
different from any other DB that you see. By that, I mean he
changes what he's going to do more than anyone else. And if he gets
an opportunity, he's going to try and make a play (i.e. an
interception).''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of cornerbacks are just satisfied with coverage, just
making sure they cover their guy,'' said Carter. ``But Aeneas is
one of four or five in the league who want to cover but they also
want to make plays. Deion (Sanders) is the best at that, but Aeneas
is in that group, too. If he sees a chance for an interception, he
wants to go for that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter isn't concerned that Williams shut down Dallas's Michael
Irvin last week in Arizona's upset of the Cowboys in a wild-card
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because Aeneas is used to playing Michael because they
see each other two games a year, and he kind of knows Michael, and
he's looked at a lot of film,'' said Carter. ``I could see that
Aeneas could read Michael's routes and he could jump Michael's
routes.''
</P>
<P>
   But, promised Carter, Williams and McGinnis aren't going to see
any such similar concentration of passing Sunday. The Vikings will
spread the ball around, he said, ``and we're not going to throw to
one side more than the other. We're going to test Aeneas, we're
going to test the other side, we're going to test the safeties.
That's what we do anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the field, the Cardinals also have a fine
pair of receivers, Rob Moore and Frank Sanders. Moore, the former
Jet, is a true professional and, said Vikings cornerback Jimmy
Hitchcock, ``He's a different kind of receiver. He's tall and lanky
and has decent speed. He's not physical like Cris, but he goes up
and gets balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona surely will not be able to beat the Vikings in any
shootout. The Cardinals' defense, even with lineman Eric Swann out
with an injury, has been impressive the last three weeks _ but it
faced the Cowboys, Chargers, and Saints, a far cry from these
Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, Arizona's chances of staying close to the
Vikings will depend on its defense, but also on Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a quarterback who can win a game that's seemingly
lost,'' said Arizona coach Vince Tobin. ``He gives us that
intangible, and that's comforting to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Plummer doesn't play defense.

ISLANDERS LOOK TO FUTURE, AND SEE A GOALIE THERE
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to update with Potvin trade; SUBS 11th graf,
There was also ..., to update with Luongo signing three-year
deal.)

<P>
   Far from Long Island, where for the fifth straight season the
New York Islanders are nowhere close to making the playoffs, there
is help in Canada for the struggling franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders made a significant move Saturday when they
obtained goalie Felix Potvin from the Toronto Maple Leafs; New York
gave up defenseman Bryan Berard in the trade.
</P>
<P>
   But the team's real future in the net can be seen in the small
towns of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, where Roberto
Luongo, their first-round selection in the 1997 National Hockey
League draft, is biding his time. Widely considered to be the best
goalie in juniors, the 19-year-old Luongo led a moderately talented
Canadian junior national team to a world championship silver medal
last week and was named outstanding goaltender of the tournament.
In a few years, the Islanders expect him to be leading them to the
Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a reason he was the highest drafted goalie ever,''
said Mike Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general manager. ``In
time, we believe that he can be an elite goaltender. His
performance in the world juniors last week proved that.''
</P>
<P>
   Luongo, who was picked fourth over all in the draft, was invited
to the Islanders' training camp last September and played in
several preseason games. He flashed a deft glove hand, had
lightning-quick feet for a 6-foot-3-inch, 190-pounder and showed
intense concentration. But there were technical aspects he had to
improve.
</P>
<P>
   So after an inconsistent month in camp with the Islanders, a
disappointed Luongo was sent back to the juniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, I was disappointed not to make the team,'' Luongo
said by telephone from his home near Montreal on Friday. ``I
thought I might have had a chance to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   If Luongo were a little older, he would be closer to Long
Island, with the Islanders' minor league team in Lowell, Mass. But
players must be 20 to play in the American Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Luongo took an ordinary Val d'Or team to the Quebec
Major Junior Hockey League title and a berth in the Canadian junior
championship, the Memorial Cup. Named the league's top prospect,
Luongo posted a 27-20-5 record and a 3.09 goals against average in
54 games last season, respectable numbers considering the defense
in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Luongo would have preferred to have made the NHL this year, but
he now agrees that returning to the juniors was the right decision.
He was not ready for the NHL. Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the issue of a contract standing between Luongo
and the Islanders. Luongo's agent, Gilles Lupien, and the Islanders
failed to work out a deal by Oct. 1, the deadline to sign with a
junior team and still be eligible to be called up to the NHL during
the season. Lupien met with Milbury on Friday in Montreal, and
Luongo signed a three-year deal believed to be worth about $2.5
million, including bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Luongo has been having a season he will not
soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Luongo lay flat on his back on the ice in
Winnipeg, Manitoba, as the Russian junior national team piled up in
front of him, celebrating the overtime goal that gave it a 3-2
victory over Canada in the championship game. The disappointment
overwhelmed Luongo. Reaching the final was a proud moment for him
and for the Canadian team, which had been embarrassed the year
before. But for the ultracompetitive Luongo, second was not good
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best experience of my life,'' Luongo said. ``It was
high pressure, playing against the best players. But even though we
won the silver, I was very disappointed. I wanted to win a gold
medal. That's why you go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordie Clark, the Islanders' director of player personnel, who
deserves much of the credit for selecting Luongo, attended the
tournament. ``He made several key saves at key times,'' Clark said.
``He was their best player. Roberto took an average Canadian team
and gave them a chance to win a gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   When Luongo returns to the juniors this week, the pressure will
again be on him. During the two-week world championship tournament,
he was traded from the struggling Val d'Or to a contending team,
Acadie-Bathurst of New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an Italian immigrant father and an Irish-Canadian
mother, Luongo speaks English, Italian and French. He grew up in
St. Leonard, a town north of Montreal known as Little Italy, and
began playing hockey at the age of 8. He always wanted to be a
goalie, but his parents, Lina and Tony Luongo, insisted that he
first learn to skate. A few years later, when Luongo was cut from
his peewee team, he became a goalie. His idol is Grant Fuhr, the
St. Louis Blues goalie, ``because of his spectacular glove saves,''
Luongo said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many future NHL goaltenders from Quebec, at 15 Luongo
joined Montreal-Bourassa, a midget team that has produced the
Devils' Martin Brodeur, the Toronto Maple Leafs' Potvin, the Los
Angeles Kings' Stephane Fiset and the former Islander Eric Fichaud,
among many others. Under the direction of the goalie coaches Mario
Baril and Francois Allaire, a longtime assistant coach with the
Canadiens and most recently the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Luongo
began showing signs of potential greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaching in Montreal for goaltending is excellent,'' said
Allaire, who coached the Colorado Avalanche star Patrick Roy when
he played for the Canadiens. ``The athletes have never been so
good, too. The best players in Quebec, when they are young, want to
be goaltenders. Not many players can say, `I'm as good or better
than any goalie in the world at my age.' Roberto can.''
</P>
<P>
   One look at Luongo's gangly frame and his size-15 feet, and it
is obvious that he possesses the physical attributes. But all of
his coaches agree that it is his intelligence that sets him apart.
While playing for Acadie-Bathurst, Luongo plans to take
correspondence courses from a college in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders have no plans to rush Luongo, but even the most
conservative predictions have him playing with them some, if not
most, of next season, though he may start the season in the
American Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting drafted so high, yeah, there's pressure on me,''
Luongo said. ``But if you're going to play the game at this level,
you have to deal with that. I haven't proven anything in the NHL
yet, but hopefully I will.''

NEW IOC WON'T BE AS PERKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether or not any of the Lords of the Rings gets booted out of
the brotherhood for vote-peddling (and word is that eight or more
could be expelled), it's all but certain that none of them except
for the International Olympic Committee's 11-member executive
committee will get to choose future sites.
</P>
<P>
   That's the big change that IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch
has indicated will come in the wake of the Salt Lake City payoff
scandal. Having all 115 members vote is what created the lavish
junketeering culture, with bid cities treating the Lords to free
first-class plane trips, luxury hotel suites, gourmet meals,
expensive gifts, and shopping sprees. Not to mention reported cash
payoffs of up to $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the IOC already has an evaluation commission that
visits each city and provides a detailed technical report on
everything from sports facilities to hotels. So there's no reason
why the executive committee would need much more than a cursory
group visit to make up its mind.
</P>
<P>
   It may be too late to make the change, though, before the 2006
Winter Games are awarded in June, since the IOC would have to
reform the voting procedure on the same weekend that it would be
choosing the site.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The IOC turned a quick thumbs-down on the US Olympic Committee's
request that the 1976 medley relay swimmers be given ``appropriate
medal recognition'' now that one of the East German victors was
proven to be doped before the Montreal Games. Since nobody tested
positive at the competition, the IOC decided it had no grounds to
change the results. ``There is no legal basis to withdraw the
medals or present medals to other athletes,'' said IOC director
general  &UR; Francois Carrard &LR; . ``Unfortunately, there are too many
variables to attempt to redraw Olympic history.'' If the East
Germans want to give their medals to the Americans or donate them
to the IOC museum, the Lords say, that's up to them.  &UR; Shirley
Babashoff &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who might well have had five gold medals at Montreal
if the DDR madchen hadn't been doped, expected no consolation
prizes. ``(The IOC) doesn't care,'' she told the Orange County
Register. ``Why would they care? It's like putting mud in their
faces. They didn't catch it in time. If something would have
happened sooner ... But it's been, what, 20 years?'' The USOC has
promised to do something for the Americans, even if it's a makeup
medal at a banquet ... Lost in the uproar over the Salt Lake
scandal was a charge by IOC member (and eternal international ski
federation president)  &UR; Marc Hodler  &LR; of Switzerland that Fiat bribed
voters with free vans to make sure that the Italian resort of
Sestriere got the 1997 World Alpine Championships. Since Turin
(where Fiat is based) is vying with the Swiss resort of Sion for
the 2006 Winter Games, the Italians accused Hodler of trying to
sabotage their bid. ``A low blow to Turin 2006,'' charged La
Gazzetta dello Sport. ``The most vile accusations.'' ... Beijing
and Toronto are the front-runners in a crowded field for the 2008
Summer Games, which won't even be awarded for another two years.
The Chinese figure it's their turn since the Games haven't been
held in Asia since 1988. That's why Osaka (Japan) and Kuala Lumpur
(Malaysia) jumped in. Also in the mix are Paris, Istanbul, Buenos
Aires, Seville, and possibly Cairo. No US city is bidding, since
Atlanta was host in 1996 and Salt Lake will in 2002, but eight are
in the chase for 2012.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Startling results at last week's Russian figure skating
championships. World champion  &UR; Alexei Yagudin  &LR; was knocked off by
16-year-old  &UR; Yevgeny Plushenko  &LR; in the men's event and world
runner-up  &UR; Irina Slutskaya  &LR; finished fourth among the women. If she
were an American, Slutskaya probably would miss out on the world
team. But the Russians, who don't have to worry about due process,
might well dump  &UR; Viktoria Volchkova  &LR; and send Slutskaya, a two-time
medalist, anyway ... Why did  &UR; Elvis Stojko  &LR; ask for a medical
release for an event (the Grand Prix final) that's still two months
off? Because his schedule is so brutal that Stojko knows he'll risk
reinjuring his cranky groin if he pushes it. As it is, the former
world champ has the Canadian nationals at month's end, then the
Four Continents competition in late February and the world
championships in late March, just two weeks after the GP final ...
Texas running back  &UR; Ricky Williams  &LR; could become the third man in
six years to win both the Heisman Trophy and the AAU's Sullivan
Award as the nation's top amateur athlete.  &UR; Peyton Manning  &LR; hit the
double last year, as  &UR; Charlie Ward  &LR; did in 1993. Other finalists
include Kentucky quarterback  &UR; Tim Couch &LR; , &UR;  &LR; basketball players
 &UR; Elton Brand  &LR; (Duke) and  &UR; Chamique Holdsclaw  &LR; (Tennessee), hurdler
 &UR; Angelo Taylor &LR; , &UR;  &LR; baseball player  &UR; Pat Burrell  &LR; (Miami), golfers
 &UR; Matt Kuchar  &LR; and  &UR; Jenny Chuasiriporn &LR; , &UR;  &LR; diver  &UR; Mark
Ruiz &LR; , &UR;  &LR; gymnast  &UR; Kristen Maloney &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and wrestler  &UR; Sammie Henson &LR; 
... Skiers  &UR; Picabo Street  &LR; and  &UR; Jonny Moseley  &LR; are the first
athletes from the same sport to win the USOC's Sportsman and
Sportswoman of the Year award since speedskaters  &UR; Dan Jansen  &LR; and
 &UR; Bonnie Blair  &LR; did it in 1994. Street is one of only five women to
win it twice, and the first since Blair.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Olympic ski champions have been dropping like flies since
Nagano. Street (broken leg/blown knee), Germany's  &UR; Katja Seizinger
 &LR; (fractured shin/knee ligaments), and France's  &UR; Jean-Luc Cretier
 &LR; (torn ACL) all are down for the season, and Seizinger and Cretier
may retire ... Disappointing placement for the US junior ice hockey
team, which finished eighth at the world championships after
winning silver two years ago. Though the Yanks won their final
three games, stunning the host Canadians, 5-2, they were already
dead meat after dropping their first three. Star of the squad was
BC sophomore  &UR; Brian Gionta &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who scored six goals. The Russians
beat Canada in overtime to claim their 10th title in 23 years ...
Three-way wrangle among the IOC and the international federations
for soccer and track and field. When FIFA said it was considering
holding biennial World Cups in odd-numbered years, which would
conflict with the IAAF world outdoor championships, the IAAF said
it might shift to even-numbered years and make the Olympic
track-and-field competition an under-23 event, which soccer does.
Nobody expects that to happen, but it was a warning shot put across
a couple of bows ... Even if drug labs come up with reliable tests
for banned human growth hormones and erythropoietin by 2000, it's
unlikely that they'll be used at the Sydney Games. The tests
probably would involve blood instead of urine and since that's more
invasive and controversial, the IOC won't use them unless they are
100 percent accurate.

GETTING ON BOARD AS JETS TAKE OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ New England sports fans are taught to hate all
things New York. As children, we learn to loathe pinstripes and all
forms of Yankees, Knicks, and Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   In our dozens of local colleges and universities, young adults
from New England and New York spend countless hours arguing and
hazing one another. It usually starts with something like ``Yankees
(expletive),'' which solicits the clever retort of ``Red Sox
(expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   This is why it is so hard to come to you this morning with the
suggestion that you root for the New York Jets for the rest of this
NFL playoff season.
</P>
<P>
   Give it up, Patriots fans. Your season is over. Much as it
hurts, you might as well start rooting for the Jets. Maybe they'll
remind you of jambalaya and the magic Patriot ride of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets actually look a lot like the Patriot team that went to
the Super Bowl two years ago. They have Bill Parcells, Al Groh,
Bill Belichick, Curtis Martin, and Dave Meggett. Like the Patriots
of '96, they won the AFC East and got a first-round playoff bye.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets Sunday play Jacksonville in their first home playoff
game in 12 years. When the '96 Patriots met Pittsburgh, it was New
England's first home playoff game in 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   There's a feeling in New York that is remarkably similar to the
good atmosphere that permeated New England two years ago. Parcells
has a heady mix of old and young guys, peaking at the end of the
year, yet is not quite sure what to expect when the playoffs start.
There haven't been many big Jet games in recent years, just as
there weren't many important Patriot games in the years before
Parcells rescued the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Like the pre-Tuna Patriots, the Jets were an NFL joke for years.
But now they are favored to play in the AFC Championship Game next
week. With a little luck, they could make it all the way to the
Super Bowl. Just like You Know Who two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Jet locker room is sprinkled with ex-Patriots who made the
ride to New Orleans including Martin, Meggett, Keith Byars, Corwin
Brown, Otis Smith, Mike Gisler, and Ray Lucas. Jerome Henderson
also played for Parcells with the Patriots in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff is even more familiar. Belichick was
Parcells's assistant head coach for Super Bowl XXXI. Groh, Maurice
Carthon, Romeo Crennel, Mike Sweatman, and Charlie Weis also worked
with Parcells in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuna was in his glory this past week. In '96 he talked about
how much he liked his team. It's the same here now. He's reached
the comfort stage where he even teases some of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that rookie offensive tackle Jason Fabini was heavily
penalized early in the season, Parcells said, ``We were calling him
`False-Start Fabini.''' In contrast, guard Todd Burger was not
penalized once all year, which prompted the Tuna to say, ``We tell
him, `Maybe you can't get close enough to hold 'em.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said that cornerback Aaron Glenn, who missed the last three
games with a sprained ankle, won't start. In typical Tuna fashion,
Parcells quipped, ``I don't want anyone playing this game that's
got a built-in excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. The Tuna sounded like he was talking about Terry Glenn's
sister.
</P>
<P>
   He said this Jet team reminds him of the '94 Patriot team that
put New England in the playoffs for the first time in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to win seven games in a row to get in,'' he remembered.
``We were 3-6 and down, 20-0 (to Minnesota). So the prospects
weren't very good. The similarity is, the confidence level of that
team, I think, is similar to the confidence level of this team.
They had been in a pressure game every week, so they'd been under
the gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with this team, the Miami and Buffalo games
back-to-back on the road were like playoff games for us. Both teams
were ready, both crowds hostile, both national games against tough
division rivals.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he's back in the playoffs. Just like with the Patriots
in '96.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled and said, ``If you don't have a little excitement
about this, you're in the wrong game.''

<P>
   So go ahead and root for the Jets, you New England football
fans. Maybe it will remind you of the good old days from two years
ago. It's no big deal, really _ especially when you remember that
someday soon you'll be asked to support a team that plays home
games in Hartford.

FALCONS CLAW WAY PAST 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Dirty Birds nearly ate crow Saturday, but in the
end they ate up the 49ers instead.
</P>
<P>
   In a game they should have been dominating by halftime, the
Atlanta Falcons gave the longtime NFL powerhouse every opportunity
to knock them out of the playoffs but the aging Niners couldn't
quite do it. Their legs were a little too old and their bones were
a little too brittle and the Falcons put just a little too much
doubt in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Not a lot, just enough. Just enough to claim a bone-crushing
20-18 victory at the Georgia Dome that sent the Falcons to their
first NFC Championship Game, against the winner of Sunday's
Minnesota-Arizona matchup.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons ran out to a 14-0 lead by pounding a defense
weakened by injury and age with a young running back named Jamal
Anderson and by harassing the San Francisco offense with a defense
that was younger, faster, and more aggressive. All of that seemed
to have wrought a rout after Chuck Smith picked up an apparent
Terry Kirby fumble and returned it for a 43-yard touchdown and a
21-0 lead with 1:57 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But before TV clickers could start switching to the Cartoon
Network or the Discovery Channel, whistles started blowing and next
thing you knew everything had changed. The officials correctly
ruled that Kirby had fumbled a backward pass from Steve Young but
was down when he fell on it because Falcon linebacker Cornelius
Bennett landed on him going for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   That negated the rest of the play and nearly the entire first
half of Falcon dominance. Three plays later, rookie linebacker
Keith Brooking blew a coverage and left 49er back Chuck Levy so
open that he ran 34 yards with a Young pass and two plays after
that Young found Jerry Rice with a 17-yard TD pass that made it
14-7 with 70 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays after that, the supposedly dying 49ers rose up, and
defensive tackle Junior Bryant intercepted a Chris Chandler pass
that was tipped by Charles Haley to set up a 36-yard Wade Richey
field goal as time expired. Thus the Falcons went into their locker
room having held the Niners' league-leading rushing game to 9
yards, knocked out Garrison Hearst with a broken leg on the first
play, and injured his backup, Kirby, three plays later _ yet barely
held the lead, 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   Enraged, 35-year-old safety Eugene Robinson, who had been a part
of many classic battles with the 49ers while in Green Bay, roared
at his young teammates that it was time to make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in here and said we can't let a team like the 49ers
back into the game,'' Robinson said. ``We made a relatively easy
game hard and now they were smelling blood. If we'd gone up 21, we
could have broken their spirit and we could have easily been in
that position. But we weren't. Now we had to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Fight they did, and it was Robinson who showed them how. After
the Falcons had gone for it and failed on fourth and 1 near
midfield to open the second half, you could feel the momentum
shifting. Down the 49ers marched again, moving from their 42 to the
Falcon 24, intent on taking the lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for someone to make a play and that turned out to be
Robinson, who read Young perfectly, cut in front of Terrell Owens
at the Falcon 3 and picked off a pass, returning it 77 yards to the
49er 20.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the battle was not over. The 49ers refused to buckle to
Anderson (who had 83 yards at halftime but only 30 in the second
half), and Atlanta had to settle for two Morten Andersen field
goals that followed Robinson's interception and one by William
White to lead, 20-10, with 10:33 to go.
</P>
<P>
   With Hearst out and Kirby limping, Young had no running game to
fall back on, so he began to rifle passes, completing seven
straight, including a 33-yarder to J.J. Stokes on third and 4. He
capped a 13-play drive that consumed 7 minutes and 36 seconds with
an 8-yard run to cut the deficit to 20-18 with 2:57 remaining after
holder Ty Detmer took a high snap and found tight end Greg Clark
for a 2-point conversion that stunned the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the things we'd been faced with, with 2:57 left, I
really felt we'd get the ball back, move down the field, and Wade
Richey would be the hero,'' a dejected Young said. ``I would have
bet on it.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had, he would have lost, but not before the Falcons gave
him one last chance. Anderson, who had done so much all day by
running for two touchdowns and controlling the clock with his power
rushes, foolishly ran out of bounds on third down with 53 seconds
left and the Niners out of timeouts. That stopped the clock, forced
a punt, and presumably gave Young one last chance.
</P>
<P>
   But R.W. McQuarters fielded that punt at the 11 and ran backward
7 yards before being hauled down. It was the kind of mistake you
make after a long day of punishment. Young would throw five times
after that in hopes of repeating his miracle finish of a week ago,
when he beat another aging champion, the Packers, as time ran out,
but these were not the old Packers. Nor were they the old Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you saw a changing of the guard,'' Robinson said.
``They fought tremendously but we're not the lowly Falcons anymore.
The days of kicking sand in our face are over. They ain't doing
that anymore.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A spin, a twist, changed the entire complexion of the
playoff clash between San Francisco and Atlanta in the Georgia Dome
on Saturday. It was a 7-yard run and a spinning move by running
back Garrison Hearst on the game's first play from scrimmage that
made the 49ers play the rest of the game looking backward. Hearst
broke the fibula in his left leg on the play.
</P>
<P>
   A spin, a twist, that tossed the 49ers for a loop.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, though, played this game full throttle. Smashing faces.
Pulverizing bodies. It was a punishing defense and a rugged,
run-oriented offense _ Falcons staples this season _ that Atlanta
used once again to make its mark. This one is lasting. The Falcons
beat San Francisco, 20-18, before 70,262 fans and improved to 15-2.
Atlanta moves on to the National Football Conference championship
game for the first time next Sunday, where it will play the winner
of Sunday's Arizona-Minnesota game.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta won by intercepting Steve Young three times, by
committing fewer penalties and by winning in possession time. It
won with staying power and resolve, withstanding a late Young rally
and then the 49ers' last-gasp drive for another miracle finish.
Atlanta won with speed and youth and veteran leadership, with a
solid game plan that played to its strengths of power and quickness
and intelligence. It won with the emotional return of its head
coach, Dan Reeves, from heart surgery. It won with nifty
special-teams play. It advanced because it enjoyed superb success
in strategy and in execution.
</P>
<P>
   But the critical factor was the running game. Atlanta produced
one. San Francisco could not.
</P>
<P>
   After Hearst went down, San Francisco ran the ball 19 times. No
49ers back had a run longer than Hearst's seven yards. Then
Hearst's backup, Terry Kirby, bruised his leg. That hurt the 49ers,
too. The 49ers averaged 2.3 yards a carry and finished with only 46
rushing yards. Young threw the ball 37 times.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta featured Jamal Anderson, a bruising back who crushed the
49ers. He scored on runs of two and 34 yards that put Atlanta
ahead, 14-0, with 3 minutes 12 seconds left before halftime. He
finished with 113 rushing yards; the Falcons totaled 136 and
averaged 4.1 yards a carry. Atlanta ran the ball 33 times and
passed it only 19.
</P>
<P>
   No Hearst, a Pro Bowl back.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Anderson, a Pro Bowl back.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides could deduce the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``My running game took a couple of hits,'' 49ers Coach Steve
Mariucci said. ``A lot of responsibility was placed on Steve
Young's shoulders and our passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco cornerback Marquez Pope said: ``It changed the way
the whole offense was going to flow. We got down, 14-0, and,
coupled with that, it really changed the offense. We knew coming in
that Anderson was going to be a key, too. We did not want him to be
in control like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan cringed when he saw Hearst's leg
twist and then break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, I grabbed my leg and my ankle,'' Buchanan said. ``It
looked that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons linebacker Jessie Tuggle said: ``When Hearst went down,
it changed the game a lot because though they have capable backups,
Hearst is their man in the running game. Their main man.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, nonetheless, fought back.
</P>
<P>
   It scored 10 points in the final 3:12 of the first half, a
touchdown on a Young-to-Jerry Rice throw of 17 yards and a Wade
Richey field goal as time expired. Atlanta led, 14-10, at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' first-half touchdown drive featured a bizarre lateral
by Young to Kirby that Atlanta thought it had scooped up and
returned for a touchdown. The officials ruled, however, that Kirby
had recovered the ball and was down by contact before it became
loose again. Following their touchdown, the 49ers quickly gained an
interception that set up Richey's field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in and our guys looked kind of puzzled,'' Atlanta
receiver Terance Mathis said.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler (13 of 19 for 169 yards with
one interception and eight passes for first downs) said: ``Terance
kept telling us it wasn't going to be easy. He told as at halftime.
He told us all during the second half. He kept pushing everybody to
stay focused. It made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis said: ``I realized that we were playing that team for the
third time and they are the San Francisco 49ers. They have come in
here in games past and embarrassed us. I kept telling our guys to
expect them to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle remembered this about the 49ers: ``There was one game
here a few years ago when they scored more than 50 points on us.
There was a game where I think they got 24 points in one quarter.
Steve Young said after that game that he felt like he was in a
practice session. That hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Atlanta stuck together.
</P>
<P>
   It intercepted Young with 4:44 left in the third quarter, with
safety Eugene Robinson returning the pass meant for receiver J.J.
Stokes 77 yards to the San Francisco 20. That set up Morten
Anderson's 29-yard field goal with 1:16 left for the only points in
the third quarter. ``I read the route,'' Robinson said of his
leaping grab near the Atlanta goal line.
</P>
<P>
   On the 49ers' next drive early in the fourth quarter, safety
William White intercepted a Young pass meant for tight end Greg
Clark and returned it 14 yards to the San Francisco 36. Another
Anderson field goal followed, from 32 yards, and the Falcons led,
20-10, with 10:33 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one,'' Young said, ``J.J. beat his man so badly off
the ball that I was going to give it to him right away, so I threw
it and he kept going into his route and the defender came over and
took it. On the second one, I assumed that Greg Clark was going to
break off of the linebacker, but he read it differently. It is my
fault that it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Young (23 of 37 for 289 yards) then drove the 49ers 87 yards in
13 plays in 7:36, running eight yards for the score, and after a
two-point conversion, it was suddenly a 20-18 game with 2:57 left.
Plenty of time for another rally by Young and the 49ers, who got to
this game by defeating Green Bay on the last play of last Sunday's
wild-card game.
</P>
<P>
   This time the rally didn't happen. The 49ers got the ball back
for one last-ditch try on a drive that started at their four with
38 seconds left. The game ended on another White interception, on a
desperation toss from the San Francisco 26 that was swiped at the
Atlanta 35.
</P>
<P>
   A spin, a twist, of fate and fortune. Reeves _ who coached on
the sideline for the entire game _ knows plenty about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made all of the difference in the world playing at home,
getting that home-field advantage; I'm convinced that's a big
reason why we won this game,'' Reeves said. ``You preach and teach,
and these guys listened and accomplished this. This group
collectively is as good as I've been around. They sacrifice to win.
They respond. This is such a fragile business; you never know. But
with this group of guys, I'll take my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, 49ers defensive end Chris Doleman announced his
retirement after 14 seasons with Minnesota, Atlanta and San
Francisco. He had 15 sacks this season, the second-highest total of
his career, and is fourth in career sacks with 142{.

BY TRADING BERARD FOR POTVIN, ISLANDERS GO ON DEFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>

 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In order to implement their new philosophy _ defensive
practicality over offensive flair _ the Islanders had to make some
personnel changes. They started Saturday, acquiring discontented
goalie Felix Potvin from the Toronto Maple Leafs for offensive
defenseman Bryan Berard.
</P>
<P>
   Potvin, 27, who left the Maple Leafs without permission on Dec.
2 and demanded a trade, joined the Islanders for Saturday night's
game in Montreal. He was the back-up goalie to Marcel Cousineau,
who started instead of Tommy Salo, whom Potvin is expected to
replace eventually. At the request of Mike Milbury, the Islanders'
coach and general manager, Salo remained at the team hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Potvin, who was 160-149-49 with a 2.87 goals against average and
12 shutouts in seven seasons with the Maple Leafs, led Toronto to
the Campbell Conference finals in 1993. He became a reserve this
season after the Leafs signed free agent Curtis Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felix Potvin's experience at this level is a little bit
deeper,'' said Milbury, who indicated that he and the Maple Leafs
had worked out the trade before Christmas. The trade was put on
hold when Berard suffered a strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   Potvin told television reporters in Montreal, ``I'm real happy,
it's a relief to finally be able to wear another uniform and I'm
really looking forward to playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams also traded sixth-round draft picks in this year's
entry draft.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Berard, who won the Calder Trophy as the National
Hockey League's top rookie just two seasons ago, Milbury said: ``He
is a dynamic young player. I'm concerned that he'll make me look a
bit foolish in a run-and-gun offense like Toronto's. But I can't
worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, 0-5-1 in their last six games, entered Saturday
night's game tied for 12th in the 14-team Eastern Conference, and
it was clear that changes were coming. Salo, who may be dealt
(Edmonton and Nashville are the leading candidates) as early as
Sunday, has been inconsistent again this season. He most recently
missed six games with a broken finger on his stick hand.
</P>
<P>
   Salo has cooled considerably after a hot start. His shaky
performance in a 5-0 loss in Philadelphia last Thursday may have
forced Saturday's trade. The Islanders were 22nd in the NHL in
goals against average and had more scoring chances than their
opponents in 20 of the last 24 games, but had little to show for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Berard, once considered the future of the franchise, had
struggled since winning the Calder Trophy in 1996. After a
disastrous sophomore season, in which his plus-minus rating was a
minus-32, Islanders coaches tried to rein in his puck-rushing
style, but the result appeared to confuse the 21-year-old
defenseman. Unsure of his standing on the team, Berard went to
Milbury last month and asked if he was being offered around the
league. He was told that he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Berard was leading Islanders defensemen with 15 points this
season, despite missing the last eight games. He is in the final
year of his contract and will be a restricted free agent this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to go to a team like Toronto with a great
tradition and they are playing great,'' Berard said in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Potvin has one more year on his contract at about $2.7 million,
part of which Toronto will pick up. He likes to stay in the crease,
allowing shooters to see more of the net. But his quickness offsets
his positioning. He is a butterfly goalie, much like his idol,
Patrick Roy of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The knock on Potvin is that he is susceptible to high shots. He
is also not known for his puck-handling ability.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's deal will probably not be the last the Islanders
make. In addition to the possibilty of trading Salo, most likely
for a forward, the Islanders are thought to be shopping center
Robert Reichel and wing Bryan Smolinski.

LUKAS' CAPE CANAVERAL WINS SAN MIGUEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ His pedigree and physique suggest Cape
Canaveral won't run as well at longer distances, but with a perfect
record and aggressive D. Wayne Lukas training, the 3-year-old is
sure to get a chance to try.
</P>
<P>
   The stocky son of Mr. Prospector and Seaside Attraction is 2 for
2 _ never having trailed in a race _ after he and jockey David
Flores ground out a one-length victory over Aristotle and two
others in the $102,508 San Miguel Stakes at Santa Anita on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The wins came at 6 and 6{ furlongs. Now Lukas must choose
between entering Cape Canaveral in the 7-furlong San Vicente on
Feb. 6 or waiting for a mile race here or at Gulfstream Park in
Florida. The colt is one of the 21 horses Lukas nominated for the
1[-mile Santa Anita Derby on April 3. The 1\-mile Kentucky Derby is
May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody always speculates about a Mr. Prospector, and if
they run 1:09, they think they're a sprinter,'' Lukas said. ``My
thought is that people have opinions, horses have the facts. I have
to think if it's in the gene pool, he'll be able to (race long). At
this time of year, everybody's questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cape Canaveral's 1:09.15 was the third-slowest clocking in the
past 10 San Miguels. He paid a miserly $2.40.
</P>
<P>
   Another prospective short-priced stakes winner will be in
evidence today when Silver Charm, 3-5 on the morning line for the
San Pasqual Handicap, begins his 5-year-old season. Santa Anita
Handicap winner Malek is his main competition in a field that's
down to five after Musical Gambler was scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm got no winter break and was reportedly strong in
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fit and ready for 1999,'' trainer Bob Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Santa Anita's other stakes, the Santa Ysabel for
3-year-old fillies, went to Holywood Picture, who paid $13.60
despite a solid win last time out. Trainer Jim Chapman's
self-effacing comment: ``You've got Octavio (Vergara) riding and me
training, so that probably takes care of a lot of the respect.''...
David Flores rode his eighth, ninth and 10th winners of the meet to
jump from sixth to a tie for third in the standings behind leader
Kent Desormeaux (13).... At Gulfstream Park, Sir Bear and Jerry
Bailey wore down Behrens and Jorge Chavez to win the Broward
Handicap, a step toward the Jan. 30 Donn. Sir Bear ($4.40) was
coming off a victory in Aqueduct's Cigar Mile.... Silver Charm will
be the first Kentucky Derby champion to race at age 5 since Strike
the Gold, the 1991 winner, not since Ferdinand, the '86 winner. The
misinformation in the Kentucky Derby record book published by
Churchill Downs was repeated by reporters last week.

 &HT;    Clues lead students to teacher's past as pedophile
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett and Jennifer Peltz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The secrets of Walter Weerts' past
flashed onto a computer screen with a click, confirming the fears
of two of his students.
</P>
<P>
   At the Illinois prison system's Internet Web site, designed to
resemble a cell door lock, they had selected the ``Find an Inmate''
box, typed in his name and learned the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Weerts, the 63-year-old award-winning horticulture teacher at
Palm Beach Community College, was also a convicted child molester,
a pedophile Catholic priest who had gone to prison for assaulting
three boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost fell off my chair,'' said one of the students, who
requested anonymity. ``I typed the name again to make sure. But his
record popped up again. There was no mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of minutes, the two students had discovered what
Weerts had hidden for most of the past decade by passing off his
prison term on his resume as a ``career transition.''
</P>
<P>
   The priest who once supervised him didn't tell all he knew
either, giving Weerts a glowing reference. The college accepted
what it was told without checking further.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19, within three weeks of the Internet discovery, Weerts
resigned, citing ``reasons of health,'' as the college mobilized to
fire him for lying.
</P>
<P>
   The man who was about to receive the campus Teacher of
Excellence award had fallen fast and hard into disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   In five years, Weerts had tripled the number of horticulture
students to 120 and made his department a model for others around
the state, educators said. He had launched new courses and
specialty programs, and he had made it possible for students to
earn a four-year degree through a partnership with the University
of Florida's Davie branch.
</P>
<P>
   Weerts had left his mark along every sidewalk and driveway at
the Palm Beach Gardens campus, lining them with blooming plants.
And he had also made inroads at the county's public schools,
teaching at Jupiter High School and giving talks to middle-school
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Iron fist in 'Wally's World'
</P>
<P>
   His college students said Weerts ruled ``Wally's World,'' as
they called the horticulture program, with a green thumb and an
iron fist.
</P>
<P>
   As the fall term progressed, some students and associates began
to question Weerts' behavior, and became especially troubled as
they watched him with the 8-year-old ``adopted grandchild'' he
called Manny.
</P>
<P>
   The students, some of whom Weerts used as baby sitters, asked
that their identities be withheld because they feared reprisals
from Weerts, the college or students loyal to their former
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Weerts had met the boy in Las Cruces, N.M., while attending
graduate school. Manny had been a regular visitor to Weerts' home
on Birmingham Drive in Palm Beach Gardens, spending the summer and
holidays there, police authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The two students who would later track him through the Internet,
both of whom are mature and married, said they found it unsettling
to see the boy follow Weerts through the campus nursery _ and to
hear Weerts and the child say they shared the same bed.
</P>
<P>
   Police would later find no evidence Weerts abused Manny.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, one of the students said, ``The more we saw of
them together, the more uncomfortable it became. But we never had
anything concrete to think something could be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In the classroom, Weerts, known among his students for a quick
temper and overbearing manner, grew more explosive. He seemed
detached and confused, students said, once repeated the beginning
of his lecture four times during the same class, apparently
oblivious to the repetition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said the same words as if he hadn't been there to hear
what had come out of his mouth,'' one student said. ``We thought
his health might be declining.'' Weerts had had a heart attack
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Weerts would detour into non sequiturs and sexually suggestive
remarks, students said. His ramblings held clues to his past.
</P>
<P>
   He had told his classes often that he had studied Latin for 10
years and that, while at university in Rome, he had loved going to
the soccer fields and watching young boys play. He often used
biblical references, students added.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day it just hit me all at once,'' said the student who
initiated the Internet search. ``The whole picture just flashed
together _ the Latin, Rome, the playgrounds. This was a pedophile
priest.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the students took to the Internet, searching for
lists of sexual offenders.
</P>
<P>
   They first tried the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's
site but found nothing. Then they moved to the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children's site. Knowing he was from
Illinois, they followed a link to the Illinois Department of
Corrections' site, where they quickly found his record.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after their Dec. 4 Internet find, the students took
their evidence to college officials and then to the Palm Beach
County Sheriff's Office. PBCC personnel director Ellen Grace said
the authorities then asked the college to postpone action until
they finished investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's office would find ``no evidence whatsoever that
anything happened to this kid,'' said Sgt. Jim Stormes.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attempts to contact Weerts by phone and mail have been
unsuccessful. He has moved out of his Palm Beach Gardens home;
authorities say he may have left the state.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Weerts was the priest of two small-town churches
in western Illinois and the head of religious education in a local
Catholic high school. His crime rent the communities, said the
lawyers who pursued criminal and civil cases against him. Weerts'
own lawyer from that time said he didn't remember the details.
</P>
<P>
   Weerts pleaded guilty to sexual abuse, and the victims' lawsuit,
which blamed the Diocese of Springfield, Ill., for not preventing
the abuse, was settled for an undisclosed amount.
</P>
<P>
   Priest wishes Weerts well
</P>
<P>
   But when Palm Beach Community College contacted Weerts' superior
in the diocese, the Rev. Kevin Laughery said Weerts had left
because he ``changed career,'' cq college records show.
</P>
<P>
   Laughery acknowledged he did not disclose Weerts' crimes, though
he knew about them. Nor did he mention that the diocese had sent
Weerts to the church's rehabilitation center for pedophile priests
in Jemez Springs, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``I answered the questions I was asked,'' Laughery said last
week. ``At that point, I was wishing what was best for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Weerts' other references came from places he worked after his
prison term. Neither reference mentioned his criminal record _ and
at least one of them didn't know about it. The other did not return
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Weerts gave PBCC a resume listing his years in
prison as a ``period of career transition.'' Where his 1993
application asked if he had ever been convicted of a crime, he
wrote ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the college has not conducted its own criminal
history searches, relying instead on the honesty of applicants and
their references. But the college now plans to do those searches,
Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach County School District also plans to do its own
research on the instructors, like Weerts, who teach college-credit
classes in the public schools, spokesman Nat Harrington said. The
district already does nationwide criminal history searches on all
its own employees, he said. But Until now, it has ``relied on the
(colleges) to provide people who were quality, qualified people,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   After authorities concluded their investigation, PBCC officials
confronted Weerts with his deception and said they would fire him,
said Grace, PBCC's personnel director. Weerts decided to resign
first, Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of a remarkable turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a decade earlier, prosecutors had asked a judge
to sentence Weerts to 30 years. He was sentenced to six and served
three, nearly all in Illinois' showcase prison.
</P>
<P>
   A product of the 1960s, the Vienna Correctional Center put
rehabilitation ahead of punishment. It didn't have fences,
watchtowers, or inmate uniforms. But it had courses in topics from
surveying to cosmetology, a policy of giving prisoners the keys to
their own individual rooms, and a 72-acre lake where inmates could
angle for contributions to a monthly fish fry, said Larry Mizell,
the warden when Weerts was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, Vienna was Fantasy Island,'' Mizell said. ``Every
opportunity in the world was there for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Weerts took advantage of classes in journalism and horticulture,
Illinois prison system spokesman Nic cqHowell said.
</P>
<P>
   The former priest found a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years after his release, Weerts was working on a
master's degree at New Mexico State University, helping a professor
research water-conserving methods of landscaping in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Months after graduation, Weerts won his job at PBCC by giving a
panel of professors a sample lesson on maintaining turf. His
competition for the job had a Ph.D doctorate, but Weerts'
``teaching skills were most impressive,'' said committee head Betty
Woolfe.
</P>
<P>
   When Weerts took the job and moved to Florida in 1993, he had no
legal obligation to inform authorities here that he was a convicted
child molester. The state's Sexual Predators Act, which requires
the worst offenders to register with the FDLE, does not apply to
those convicted before 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Worked 105 hours a week
</P>
<P>
   Weerts was automatically tenured in his fourth year of teaching,
Grace said. By the time he left, college records show, he was
making $38,100 a year as the horticulture program leader _ a
first-rung administrative post.
</P>
<P>
   Records show he was also paid $600 a term to supervise the
school's Horticulture Forum, a student club that held immensely
popular public plant sales and contracted for projects on and off
campus. As the adviser, Weerts oversaw both the projects and the
club's finances, reporting periodically to administrators, college
spokeswoman Ann Chronic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody would pull a weed in that club until Wally told them
how to do it and when to do it,'' said one club officer who asked
not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Nurseries and landscapers worked with the Horticulture Forum in
joint ventures, donating plants and services to the college.
Professionals in the field formed an advisory board to shape the
horticulture department's future. Students built a footbridge over
a wetlands area Weerts cultivated on campus. He routinely worked
105 hours a week in the greenhouse and nursery, associates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to work this hard if I want this program to succeed,''
he was fond of saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very domineering, even with the advisory board,'' said
MarthAnne Mitchell, a master gardener for Palm Beach County and an
advisory board member. ``He brought in the top people in the county
to give him advice, and then he wouldn't listen to them. He always
did what he wanted to do. Some of the board members got frustrated.
Why waste your time if nobody's going to listen to you?''
</P>
<P>
   Boy returns to N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Weerts' exit makes the club's future uncertain, though the
college has found temporary replacements to teach his classes this
term, Chronic said. The college expects to have a full-time
replacement by fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Weerts' exposure, college and law
enforcement officials are assessing what went wrong, or what might
have.
</P>
<P>
   Manny, the 8-year-old boy, has returned to family in Las Cruces
where social workers have interviewed him, according to the New
Mexico State Police. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office asked
them for help.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Jose Ramirez, the state police investigation supervisor in
Las Cruces, said social workers interviewed the child and are
continuing to monitor him.
</P>
<P>
   At PBCC, administrators have asked other institutions for advice
about doing criminal background checks and how to handle the
results.
</P>
<P>
   Under college rules, Weerts could have been fired just for lying
about his criminal past. But the nature of his offense made it all
the more unacceptable, Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say categorically, `We would never hire anyone who'd
been convicted of a felony,' '' Grace said, though she couldn't
specify an offense the college would be willing to overlook. But,
she said, ``No one with a background of sexual offenses would be
hired, period.''

PENSIONS (undated) _ Valley land speculators have borrowed millions
of dollars from government worker pension funds in deals that
involve potentially high risks. An Arizona Republic &UR; review of
public records shows that three retirement funds currently have
more than $88 million invested in real estate ventures. And at
least two of the many loans involve developers who helped wipe out
Arizona thrifts a decade ago when the land market nose-dived. All
told, pension real estate deals account for just 2 percent of a $5
billion pool, and there is no evidence that the retirement plans

 &HT;    Broncos stampede past Dolphins
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Next to Saturday afternoon's divisional playoff game,
the big event here this weekend was something called the National
Western Stock Show. About six miles from where horses and cattles
cavorted, however, was the real stampede.
</P>
<P>
   Led by former University of Georgia spare part Terrell Davis,
who rushed for 199 yards and two touchdowns, the Denver Broncos ran
roughshod over the Miami Dolphins. Their 38-3 victory, which lifted
the Broncos to next Sunday's AFC Championship Game against the
winner of today's Jacksonville-New York Jets matchup was an
impressive display of power football.
</P>
<P>
   Denver scored on its first three series, driving 92, 66 and 87
yards for touchdowns. On all three possessions, Davis provided the
impetus. Davis was chosen by the Associated Press as the NFL's Most
Valuable Player earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Limited to just 29 yards on 16 carries in the Broncos 31-21
regular-season defeat at Miami on Dec. 21, the four-year pro
punched out 38 yards on Denver's initial possession. The drive was
highlighted by his consecutive runs of 13 and 11 yards and he
completed the march with a 1-yard blast over left guard.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Broncos ran at the left side of the Miami defense
much of the day and their line opened huge gashes in the Dolphins'
injury-decimated front four. By halftime, the Broncos led 21-3 and
Davis already had 16 rushes for 129 yards. On the first snap of the
second half, he roared through a crevice at left guard and sped 62
yards to set up a Jason Elam field goal.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared the Denver offensive staff targeted Dolphins
defensive left tackle Daryl Gardener as a weak link, even though
Miami coaches have insisted he is the team's best interior
defender. Playing without partner Tim Bowens (biceps), Gardener
simply could not anchor the inside. When he wasn't double-teamed,
he was finessed out of position, and that set up cutback runs for
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Denver had 18 offensive snaps in the first half and six of them
produced gains of 11 yards or more.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the efficient Denver offense, the Dolphins were out of
sync most of the day. On the game's opening series, Miami receivers
dropped two Dan Marino passes. Marino then connected on eight
straight passes as the Dolphins went to a no-huddle offense, but
penalties and a running game stuck in reverse killed any momentum.

 &HT;    Gospel awards show simply stellar
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The mercury may have dipped below freezing but the
roof was being raised inside the Atlanta Civic Center last night as
gospel music honored its elite during the 14th Annual Stellar
Awards show.
</P>
<P>
   The Stellar Awards, gospel music's version of the Grammy Awards,
opened with gospel singer Fred Hammond asking the crowd during a
high-energy opening number if they were ``ready for a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammond could have directed that question at himself as he won
eight Stellar awards, more than any other gospel artists Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond, a gospel veteran, was honored with Artist of the Year,
Song of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year, Album of the Year,
Producer of the Year and Contemporary Album of the Year. He also
received the Contemporary Choir of the Year award for his work with
the Radical for Christ Choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just praise God,'' Hammond said as he hoisted one of many
awards during the night. ``Don't quit,'' he told the audience
before sitting down.
</P>
<P>
   The show also saw the emergence of Karen Clark Sheard. Sheard, a
fiery gospel singer, was named Female Vocalist of the Year and
Contemporary Female Vocalist of the Year and was honored with best
Music Video of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   As with any awards show, there were some surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Mass Choir won Choir of the Year, beating out the
formidable John P. Kee and the New Life Community Choir and the
popular O'Landa Draper &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The show offstage was just as colorful as the performances on
stage. The crowd of was full of elegant women wearing furs and
pumps and men wearing elegantly tailored _ and in some cases
extremely loud _ suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen so many white suits in my life,'' comedian
Steve Harvey, the show's host, told the audience at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey was just one of many celebrities who attended the show.
Actress Lynn Whitfield, who starred in the film, ``Eve's Bayou,''
the R&AMP;B group Boyz II Men and gospel celebrities such as Bobby
Jones and Dottie Peoples also attended.
</P>
<P>
   The show was marred by several technical glitches. At varying
points, producers stopped the show, leaving the audience mumbling
in their seats as Harvey bantered with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   During one of the pauses, a woman, shouting from the audience,
asked Harvey if he knew Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't, do you think this would be the right time to ask
me?'' Harvey shot back, breaking up the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell, who personally persuaded the producers of
the Stellar Awards to come to Atlanta, greeted the crowd at the
opening of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's the blues or jazz, it all started with gospel
music,'' Campbell, a gospel music fan, said.
</P>
<P>
   Gospel music's influence on all American music was a theme
repeated during much of the night. In the past few years, gospel
music has exploded, incorporating various music forms such as rap
and R&AMP;B to reach a younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the gospel fans at Saturday's event were not worried
that gospel music will become too diluted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the roots of gospel music are too firmly planted to be
uprooted,'' said Francine Greer, a gospel music fan who prefers
traditional gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no studio enhancement,'' she said of the old-style
gospel artists. ``They can sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though gospel music may now mimic other types of music, the
message distinguishes it, said Phle' Kilcrease, who listens to
gospel every morning to prepare for her job as a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a peace when I listen to it,'' she said. ``It helps me
start the day with something positive.''

GIVEN CHOICE, MARTIN WOULD STAY A CLIPPER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A dandy attribute often associated with NBA
point-guard success is the ability to make wise decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Darrick Martin is talking after Saturday's A-list pickup game at
UCLA's men's gym, sounding like a very intelligent NBA point guard.
And now, even though the former Bruins star apparently has the
wherewithal to work for a more highly regarded organization, Martin
if full-court pressed to make a choice says he'd still prefer to be
a Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't wink or anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've always been good to me,'' says Martin, who cut his NBA
wisdom teeth as the Clippers' starting playmaker for most of the
last two seasons. ``I'd really like to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 27, became a free agent after the Clippers finished
losing 65 of last season's 82 games. He averaged 10.3 points and
four assists per game while splitting time with Pooh Richardson. At
5-foot-11, the quick lefty is drawing employment interest around
the league as someone who can reduce a team's time in moving
between points A and B.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clippers, while not dismissing the possibility of
bringing Martin back, freely admit planning an upgrade for the role
of floor leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need to get stronger at the point-guard position,''
Elgin Baylor, the team's vice president of basketball operations,
said soon after the NBA was unlocked.
</P>
<P>
   Stronger, in Clippers terms, may be defined as a point guard who
prevents dribble penetration by opposing point guards. When asked
to list the goodies he's looking for in a point guard, Baylor began
with defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good point guards out there,'' Baylor said,
``but very few point guards who can defend.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be even fewer point guards who would choose to be a
Clipper. This may give Martin an edge.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the smoke clears after the NBA's upcoming talent
safari, the Clippers may not find themselves with what they think
they want at point guard.
</P>
<P>
   All Martin wants is to be wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really so much about money,'' says Martin, who as a
candidate for stepping up to the NBA's middle class should benefit
from the league's new deal with the players' union. ``I just want
to find the best situation. I just want to go where I'm wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't wanted enough to be drafted out of UCLA but worked his
way into the NBA after touring with Magic Johnson's traveling team
and experiencing life in the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after two seasons with the Clippers, Martin wouldn't mind
staying home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys take more money and end up in a situation they're
not familiar with,'' he says. ``I'm not opposed to doing that, and
sometimes the new situation works out, but I feel comfortable with
the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the talent to build a good team. People seem to be
forgetting that we made the playoffs just two years ago. After you
hear so many Clipper jokes, it was good to put that back in their
faces. I wouldn't mind doing it again.''

   DENVER _ The ultimate indignity in this game has to be taking
the concession knee with 1:19 left, the ball at your own 20, and
the scoreboard indicating that you are down by 35.
</P>
<P>
   By then it was 38-3, Denver, and the Miami Dolphins had been
humiliated. Terrell Davis had run for 199 yards and three
touchdowns; the Denver defense had toyed with them, and lumbering
defensive end Neil Smith had scooped up a disputed fumble _ this
year, is there any other kind? _ and taken it 79 yards for the
final score. Coach Mike Shanahan had just extended Jimmy Johnson a
professional courtesy by ordering backup quarterback Bubby Brister
to take two knees after Denver had bogged down at the Miami 3, and
so The Hairsprayed One reciprocated by having Dan Marino's backup,
Damon Huard, do the same when the ball changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a shame for one of our guys, or one of
their guys, to get hurt, and hurt their chances in the playoffs,''
Johnson explained.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was done. The Denver Broncos had proven every point
necessary. They had demonstrated the meaninglessness of Miami's
31-21 Week 15 victory 19 days earlier. They had shown how much they
appreciated the bye week and extra preparation time. And they had
reminded everyone in the AFC that, as loquacious tight end Shannon
Sharpe would say, ``If you want to go to Miami in late January,
you've got to have a five-hour layover in Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was going to beat the Broncos Saturday, not least a team
that couldn't scare MIT with its ground game. Davis had 9 more
yards by his third carry (23) than the Dolphins would have all day.
He would also have 5 more yards (34) by his fourth carry than he
had in 16 carries against these same Dolphins back on Dec. 21 in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game didn't mean anything,'' Davis said. ``This was do or
die. And when you have that kind of success early in the game, it
gives you a feel for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Very seldom is it true that a game is over after two
possessions, but this one was. For after the Dolphins had a quick
three-and-out punctuated by a pair of clear dropped passes, the
Broncos put on an offensive clinic, moving 92 yards in 14 plays for
the game's first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   You want balance? Try 41 yards (38 by Davis) on the ground and
51 more (John Elway going 5 for 6) in the air. In one five-play
stretch, the Broncos picked up 8, 7, 13, 11, and 12 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Davis took it in from the 1 to finish off the time-consuming
(7:56) drive.
</P>
<P>
   After a second futile Miami possession, Denver went for the
quick kill. Taking over on his own 34, Elway (a casual, efficient
14 for 23, 189 yards, one TD) got his team into the end zone in
just four plays, the first of which was a dazzling 33-yard hookup
with wide receiver Ed McCaffrey, who put a superb move on safety
Brock Marion before extending himself to make a finger-tip grab.
The capper was a scintillating 20-yard scamper by Davis, who burst
through the line before turning both Marion and rookie loudmouth
Sam Madison into embarrassed DBs before both the 75,729 in
attendance and the millions watching on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is known for what he refers to as his ``north-south''
running style, but Saturday he ran every way but north by
northwest, and had that been required, he could have done that,
too. Suffice it to say we were all looking at a great player having
a great day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just instincts,'' he said of his many phenomenal cuts. ``Today
I took a page out of the Barry Sanders book.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 21-3 at the half and 24-3 early in the third quarter when
a 62-yard Davis romp on the first play from scrimmage set up a
34-yard Jason Elam field goal. The Broncos scored on four of their
first five possessions, the fifth being rendered moot by halftime.
Denver's first punt came 39 minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's only semblance of a scoring threat was a penetration to
the Denver 17 (trailing, 31-3). That's when Oronde Gadsden was
ruled to have fumbled following a fourth-down reception, and
11-year veteran Smith set out on his majestic excursion to the
distant end zone.
</P>
<P>
   In matters like this, it is customary for both coaches and
players to spout the ``total team effort'' cliches as media eyes
roll. But there was no other way to describe this 100 percent
trashing of a Miami team that had absolutely no chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played for 60 minutes,'' said linebacker Bill Romanowski,
one of nine Denver Pro Bowlers. ``Offense, defense, special teams.
We had to prove to the country, and to ourselves, that if we are
focused and ready to play we can beat anyone. And our attitude is
that what we did today won't be good enough to win next week. We
have to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching this, the idea of them getting ``better'' is an
abstract.

THE LOCKOUT'S WINNERS AND LOSERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin ital)``I've been locked out, I've been locked in, but I
always seem to come back again.... I've been locked out, and I know
we're through, but I can't begin to face up to the truth. I wait so
long for the walls to crack, but I know that I will one day have
you back.''(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Shaq's rap ballad of NBA lockout despair, as sung to
commissioner David Stern?
</P>
<P>
   Er, no. The lyrics are borrowed, with apologies, from '80s rock
group Crowded House, whose breakup song, ``Locked out,'' tidily
sums up the owners-players love spat as well as anything.
</P>
<P>
   In a lovers' quarrel, the sides reconcile and all is bliss. No
such luck in a greed contest. So without further delay, or further
pop-music reference, the Winners and Losers of the Lockout from
Hell:
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Stern and NBA owners. Not even a close call. The first
league to implement a salary cap just became the first to get an
absolute ceiling on individual player salaries. Add the longer,
five-year rookie deals, the marijuana policy, the pseudo-hard cap
escrow system, the reduction in annual player raises, and the
lockout ended with a knockout.
</P>
<P>
   If Stern had held out another week, the union would have gladly
thrown in Kobe Bryant's shoe contract and a year's supply of Jordan
cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Loser: David Falk. He was demonized as the Evil Genius
Puppetmaster running the union, but that's of no consequence to
Falk. What does matter to him is money, and he lost that too: The
new ceiling on player salaries means the man who represents Allen
Iverson and other young free-agents-to-be will get 5 percent of $9
million a year instead of $25 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Charities, and we're not talking about the poor
minimum-salaried players who were supposed to receive welfare from
the Showtime game. UNICEF and others made a few hundred grand
(roughly equivalent to Kevin Garnett's pay during the national
anthem) from that game in Atlantic City, while other needy
nonprofits benefited from locked-out player exhibition games in Los
Angeles, Dallas and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Loser: Charles Oakley. The veteran forward, long underpaid by
NBA standards, was to receive a $10 million balloon payment this
season to offset years of substandard salaries. Now he'll get about
$6 million instead (maybe UNICEF can help).
</P>
<P>
   Winner: The Clippers. By not hiring a coach and assistants, they
saved at least $7.35 per game, per coach (not counting per diem).
</P>
<P>
   Loser: The Clippers. OK, let's face it, they squandered months
of spare time that coaches could have used to help plan a
roster-retooling strategy. And 48 hours before the lockout's
resolution, top draft pick Michael Olowakandi signed to play in
Italy _ through Feb. 15. The whole situation is just so... well, so
!ital!Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Elden Campbell/Nick Van Exel. Van Exel's sentence for
bad behavior, a one-year banishment to Denver, has been cut by 30
games. Campbell got to extend his Lakers career by six months, his
inevitable trade put on hold by the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Loser: Kobe Bryant. Under the old system, Bryant, a free agent
this summer, would expect a Garnett-type contract paying in excess
of $21 million per year. Under the new system, he'll be capped at a
mere $9 million to start with. Lucky for him, he's got a rap album
due out soon to provide some hanging-out cash.
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Shaquille O'Neal. True, the big guy's ``Respect'' CD
didn't get Aretha Franklin-like raves, and he's had to endure such
indignities as an assault accusation at DisneyWorld and _ ack! _
bench-pressing Regis Philbin on national TV. But the long layoff
gave Shaq Daddy plenty of time to rehab the pesky abdominal muscle
that knocked him out of 22 games last season. Now he just needs to
shed a couple of pounds near said abdominal...
</P>
<P>
   Loser: Shawn Kemp. When last seen in Atlantic City, the former
Reign Man had the body of the Maytag Man. Possible explanations:
auditioning for true life story of Fat Albert; starving without a
paycheck, ate Muggsy Bogues and Spud Webb; perhaps carrying his
next seven children himself?
</P>
<P>
   Winner: Latrell Sprewell. Well, he's still a loser in spirit,
but the lockout-related drivel spewed by Alonzo ``we make a lot,
but we spend a lot'' Mourning and other nitwits made Spree looked
almost rational by comparison. And at least everyone forgot about
him for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Loser: Miami Heat locker room. Tim Hardaway and Keith Askins
were vocal critics of teammate Mourning and the union negotiating
committee. And to think, the Heat might still add Sprewell to this
warm-n-fuzzy group. Maybe Bill Parcells can teach 'em ``Kumbaya.''
</P>
<P>
   Dream on: Fans always blame player salaries for unaffordable
ticket prices, and Suns coach Danny Ainge went so far as to say the
NBA's new maximum salary will help. ``They've had to (raise ticket
prices) because of the rising costs, but if they can control
spending it shouldn't hurt the fans, it should help them,'' Ainge
said.
</P>
<P>
   A nice sentiment, but it ignores an American economic truism:
You charge what the market will bear. So we pay $7.50 for the same
movie that cost $5 a few years ago, $150 for a pair Nike Air
Jordans that cost $10 to make in a sweatshop and $30 for a Tommy
Hilfiger T-shirt, even though it's made of the same stuff as Hanes'
$10 Beefy-T.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same in the NBA. Teams will charge you as much as
you'll pay, and if someone keeps buying $50-$200 seats, they're not
going to lower them _ even if the average player salary dropped to
$20 a week. Lower overhead just means owners will pocket the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Wish for the week: That the NBA's truncated schedule means fewer
Nuggets-Clippers and Warriors-Mavericks games. If you're going to
lop off 30 games, why not kill the ones no one wanted to see in the
first place?
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the week: The new salary limits appear to diminish the
importance of agents, but Atlanta Hawks president Stan Kasten and
agent Keith Glass said otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think agents are no longer useful,'' Kasten said,
``but that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Glass: ``We're like rats; we adapt.'' &QL;

BRONCOS RESPOND, TRASHING THE TALKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Shortly after his Denver Broncos' astoundingly easy
38-3 victory over Miami in yesterday's AFC second-round playoff,
John Elway was zigging and zagging his way through the Mile High
Stadium locker room overflowing with teammates, media members and
assorted hangers-on.
</P>
<P>
   He was heading for the bathroom when he was stopped, dead in his
tracks, by a highly unusual request.
</P>
<P>
   ``John,'' some stranger asked, ``could you pose for a picture?''
</P>
<P>
   Elway looked down at his body, considered the fact that he was
dressed in his underwear, then smiled nice and pretty for the
camera, honored to share a frame with none other than trash-TV
ringmaster Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players invited me,'' said Springer, who made his mark as
a scandal-plagued mayor of Cincinnati before launching his career
as a scandal-plagued moderator of a controversially contentious
talk show. ``I'll start showing up at the NFL games in Cincinnati
as soon as we get an NFL team there.''
</P>
<P>
   Good one, but on this day, the joke was really on the Dolphins,
who provided the Broncos with everything the defending Super Bowl
champions could have wished for: a wakeup call in the form of that
Week 15 regular-season 31-21 loss at Miami; weeks of Springer-level
pregame verbal sniping used by the Broncos as motivational fodder;
and a Jimmy Johnson-assembled roster of players not yet anywhere
close to the elite of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time, they were at their best and we were at our
worst; but this time, they were again at their best, and so were
we,'' said Shannon Sharpe of the Broncos, who play host next Sunday
to the AFC Championship Game against the winner of today's
Jacksonville Jaguars-New York Jets meeting. ``That was just an
old-fashioned butt-kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   It is probably accurate to say that Denver is 5,280 feet above
Miami in more ways than just geographically. Denver, which averages
35 points a game at Mile High, the site of 18 consecutive Broncos
victories, has this nasty habit of jumping out to huge leads that
allow it to disguise any defensive liabilities. In both Broncos
losses this season, at the New York Giants and at the Dolphins, the
opponents kept it close enough to force the Denver defense to play
straight up, and the Broncos' secondary was victimized.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, two Terrell Davis touchdowns fueled the Broncos'
jump to a 14-0 lead in the first period as they captured huge
advantages in first downs (10-1), rushing yards (67-5), passing
yards (88-34) and time of possession (10:14 to 4:46).
</P>
<P>
   With 8:40 left in the second period, Davis had 11 carries for
100 yards. With 4:39 left in the second period, Davis backup Derek
Loville's 11-yard run made it 21-3. On the first play of the second
half, Davis set up a field goal and a 24-3 lead with a 62-yard
sprint. In the fourth quarter, Denver added Rod Smith's 28-yard
touchdown catch and Neil Smith's 79-yard fumble return for a score.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Davis _ who had only 29 yards in the previous
Dolphins game _ totaled 199 yards on 21 carries. Meanwhile the
Dolphins managed only 14 rushing yards on 13 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tank was pretty much empty coming in here today,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   So Denver is one victory away from another Super Bowl
appearance. And Miami _ taunted all afternoon long by some of the
crowd of 75,720 chanting ``Jim-mee! Jim-mee!'' _ is left wondering
what might have been had the Dolphins played the game as well as
they talked it, or filled up their tanks with something besides
empty boasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had something to prove,'' Elway said. ``They embarrassed us
the last time we played.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually,'' added receiver Ed McCaffrey, ``you don't need much
inspiration. I mean, it's the playoffs. But the last couple of
weeks, \RMiami's trash talking\S was getting a little tough to
swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   In the buildup to this game, Sharpe had called the outcome of
that previous meeting ``a hoax,'' suggesting the Broncos are two
touchdowns better than Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins angrily took the bait and promised a demonstration
in Denver. But in the end, in arguing for themselves as the
superior team, Miami demonstrated nothing more than naivete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really now,'' said Sharpe, ``somebody would have to play the
perfect game to even think about coming here and beating us.''

<P>
   The articles of impeachment voted by the House made 11 specific
charges against President Clinton, against which his lawyers have
raised specific defenses.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE ACCUSATIONS &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``William Jefferson Clinton willfully provided perjurious, false
and misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning one or more
of the following:''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Giving a false account of the nature and details of his
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky;
</P>
<P>
   2. Refusing to admit that he gave prior false testimony in the
Paula Corbin Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit;
</P>
<P>
   3. Allowing his attorney, Robert Bennett, to make false
statements during the president's deposition in the Jones case;
</P>
<P>
   4. Lying to aides about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in an
effort to influence their grand jury testimony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE DEFENSE &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's legal defense against these allegations has
been:
</P>
<P>
   1. The president admitted he had an ``inappropriate, intimate''
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky before the grand jury;
</P>
<P>
   2. The president contends that under the very narrow definition
of sexual relations allowed by the judge in the Jones case, he did
not lie.
</P>
<P>
   3. No perjury was involved in the statements made by Bennett at
the Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   4. There is no evidence to contradict the president's testimony
regarding comments he made to his aides; about his conversations
with Ms. Lewinsky about gifts or his description of conversations
with Betty Currie. Even Kenneth Starr did not allege perjury in
these statements.
</P>
<P>
   THE ACCUSATIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   William Jefferson Clinton ``has prevented, obstructed, and
impeded the administration of justice, and has to that end engaged
personally, and through his subordinates and agents, in a course of
conduct or scheme designed to delay, impede, cover up and conceal
the existence of evidence and testimony related to a federal civil
rights action brought against him.'' The article cites these
particulars:
</P>
<P>
   1. Encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the
Jones case;
</P>
<P>
   2. Encouraging her to give false testimony if she was called to
appear in the Jones case;
</P>
<P>
   3. Encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to conceal gifts he had given her;
</P>
<P>
   4. Helping Ms. Lewinsky secure employment to insure her silence;
</P>
<P>
   5. Allowing Bennett to make false and misleading statements
during the Jones deposition;
</P>
<P>
   6. Attempting to influence the testimony of Betty Currie;
</P>
<P>
   7. Attempting to influence the testimony of aides by giving a
false account of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's legal defense against these allegations has
been:
</P>
<P>
   1. &AMP; 2. Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony that ``No one ever
asked me to lie'' flatly contradicts charges that Clinton
encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit or give false
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   3. Ms. Lewinsky gave 10 accounts in her testimony of
conversations with Clinton about gifts and did not testify that he
suggested she hide gifts or give them to Ms. Currie.
</P>
<P>
   4. Ms. Lewinsky testified that ``no one ever offered me a job
for my silence.'' Efforts to assist Ms. Lewinsky in finding a job
began months before she appeared on the witness list in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   5. The president was not paying close attention to Bennett's
statements during the Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   6. When Clinton spoke to Betty Currie she was not a witness in
any legal proceeding and she testified that she did not feel
pressured by the president.
</P>
<P>
   7. In discussions with his aides, the president was concealing
an improper relationship, not trying to influence future testimony.
</P>
<P>

counsel for President Clinton to the House Judiciary Committee and
summary of arguments against the articles of impeachment prepared

FORUM DESERVES PROPER SENDOFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ They show up even on the days the old building is
dark, tourists from Albania and Slovenia and Japan with rental cars
and cameras and dazzled expressions, here to view an American
landmark with their own eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum. Just as it appears on TV, only no Jack Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, it's like going to Rome and seeing the
Colosseum or going to New York and seeing Yankee Stadium,'' said
Forum director of guest services Jack Peirson, who might not
believe it himself if he didn't occasionally help out visitors by
snapping photos and leading impromptu tours. ``It's amazing to see
the magic on those people's faces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forum. To the world's sports fans, it's a legend.
</P>
<P>
   And now, in its final season as a major-league arena, let's hope
we, the sports fans of Los Angeles, will show it the same
reverence.
</P>
<P>
   For months, it seemed we wouldn't get the chance. The basketball
Lakers weren't playing and the hockey Kings weren't playing well.
There was no reason to go. The Forum, home of Magic and Wayne and
the Laker Girls _ and Jack _ was destined to just fade into
history, without a proper farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us might have attended our final Forum event _ without
even knowing it at the time _ last April when the Kings were swept
out of the NHL playoffs by the St. Louis Blues, or last May when
the Lakers were swept out of the NBA playoffs by the Utah Jazz.
Nice memories.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in the past week. The Kings went on a winning
streak. The Lakers prepared to have a season after all.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum is the place to be again _ until its two famous
tenants move downtown to the Staples Center in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   And so we write today to say: Savor it while you can. Take one
last look around. Make like a tourist and fire off a flashbulb. And
_ this is directed to Lakers and Kings management _ how about a
going-away party while we're at it?
</P>
<P>
   The good news is it's going to happen, the only question being
whether any bash will be big enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice to give it a champagne-soaked farewell,'' said
Lakers spokesman John Black, meaning an NBA title, which would be
the team's seventh of the Forum era. But no specific plans have yet
been announced for a public commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Kings, team executives held their first meeting a few
days ago to plan a goodbye but aren't yet sure how they'll do it. A
public skating session on the Forum ice? A hockey-star-studded
banquet?
</P>
<P>
   The first Forum event was a 2-0 Kings loss to the Philadelphia
Flyers on the afternoon of Saturday, Dec. 30, 1967. The Lakers
played the next night and beat the San Diego Rockets 147-118.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of memories in this place,'' said Stu Nahan, who
broadcast that first Forum hockey game to the nation on CBS-TV.
``It doesn't seem old to me. It's 31 years and a month, and to me
it looks the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the arena's $18 million price tag, its Forum Club bar and
its A-list customers made it a modern wonder. To say nothing of its
featured acts: two Lakers dynasties, the Gretzky-led Kings,
Ali-Norton, Elvis. Or its warmup acts: the WNBA's Sparks, Strings
team tennis, Lazers indoor soccer, Blades roller hockey,
Monday-night boxing.
</P>
<P>
   But after 31 years and a month, its locker rooms are small, its
weight rooms outdated, its revenue stream a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women who have been at the Forum all their
professional lives are realists. Its time has come. They know the
youngsters aren't impressed at all by the Forum, once called
Fabulous, now called Great Western but increasingly old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   So just as Boston Garden, Chicago Stadium, the Philadelphia
Spectrum and the Montreal Forum were abandoned, the Forum will be
too, at a much younger age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts a lot, emotionally,'' said Elliott Berland, the Forum
press-room attendant since that first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard part is we don't know when that (last game) will
be,'' said Bill Gurney, who was 12 when he sat in a $4.50 rafters
seat for the first Kings game, and now is the coaches' video
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   It could end with the regular season. Or, as lately appears
likely, the Kings could make the playoffs but get knocked out at
any time. Or the Kings' Forum era could end with an exhibition game
before their first Staples Center season opens in October.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Forum will still be here, perhaps to play host to
boxing and women's basketball and concerts for decades to come. But
the big-league teams and most of the fans will be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Staples Center will create its own memories,'' said
Peirson, who's been a Forum employee since 1978 and intends to
stay. ``But for the fans who have been coming here for 31 years,
the Forum will always be a special place.''
</P>
<P>
   They know it in Albania. Let's show it here. &QL;

DEVILS GET INTO THE GAME TOO LATE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In the opening minute of the third
period Saturday night, a handful of hats flew onto the ice at the
Continental Arena. There was no hat trick, just a hat giveaway at
the arena and a disappointing performance by the home team.
</P>
<P>
   The tossing of the hats came when the Washington Capitals scored
just 35 seconds into the third period, taking a three-goal lead on
their way to a 3-2 victory over the Devils. While the gesture might
have been a show of derision for the Devils, it might also have
served as a reward for the Capitals, who have rebounded from a
seemingly endless string of injuries to put together their first
three-game winning streak of the season.
</P>
<P>
   If it took this long for the Capitals to realize their season
was slipping away, it seemed that the Capitals' third goal _ Joe
Juneau's first since Nov. 7 _ was enough to make the Devils realize
that this game was slipping away. The Devils finally scored three
minutes later when Vadim Sharifijanov stuffed in a rebound of a
Bobby Holik shot to cut the deficit to two goals.
</P>
<P>
   A chance make it a one-goal game was ruined by Washington
goaltender Olaf Kolzig, who collided with Denis Pederson behind the
net, then skidded back just in time to extend his stick and deflect
what looked to Jay Pandolfo like a shot toward an open net. Kolzig
then stopped Pandolfo from close range with six minutes to play
when the Devils wing took a feed from Pederson after Brendan
Morrison stole the puck. Kolzig then came up big again on a shot by
Randy McKay from the left circle with 4 minutes 9 seconds to play.
The Capitals goalie finished with 39 saves.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the Devils pulled goaltender Chris Terreri and
there were just 47.4 seconds left that they were able to convert.
Patrik Elias scored on a rush with assists from Morrison and
Pandolfo. The Devils called timeout with 13.6 seconds left, but
could not stuff the puck by Kolzig. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a 4-0 start on the season, Terreri lost his second
straight game. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Devils had beaten the Capitals in two previous meetings this
season, including a 3-2 decision 10 days ago in Washington. But in
winning their two games before this one, the Capitals, who are tied
as the third-worst scoring team in the National Hockey League, had
scored 10 goals.
</P>
<P>
   With Terreri in net for just the second time since Dec. 5, when
he picked up his last victory, the Capitals' offense continued to
produce. The Capitals got on the board first, scoring with just 59
seconds remaining in the opening period. Brian Bellows picked up a
loose puck along the boards behind the Devils' net and set up
there, faking left and right until Terreri turned his head to the
right and defenseman Lyle Odelein moved away from the net. Bellows
lunged to the post and stuffed the puck in under Terreri's glove.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals increased the lead to 2-0 at 7:18 of the second
period. The Devils' Kevin Dean deflected a Peter Bondra pass
intended for Steve Konowalchuk, but Michal Pivonka retrieved the
puck and skated in alone from the right circle. Terreri tried to
close off the near side of the net, but Pivonka continued past,
easily tucking the puck into the open side. The goal came just
three seconds after a Capitals' power play had ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils did not challenge Kolzig until the final seconds of
the second period. With 30 seconds left, Elias fed Jason Arnott
alone in front. But Kolzig stopped Arnott's shot, and the rebound
came back to Arnott, whose backhand shot went sliding wide of the
sprawling goalie.

AHEAD BY 5, DUVAL OUTRUNS THE PACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   KAPALUA, Hawaii _ While his pursuers tried to remain in
contention Saturday, David Duval remained in a class by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a five-under-par 68, Duval stood at 21 under (198) at
the Mercedes Championships and took the same five-stroke lead into
Sunday's final round that he began Saturday with. Fred Funk was in
second place at 16 under, Billy Mayfair was third at 15 under, and
Vijay Singh, Tiger Woods and Jim Furyk were tied for fourth at 14
under, a distant seven strokes behind Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning the third round with a five-stroke lead can feel like
starting the day with a bull's-eye painted on your back, and lesser
players can be intimidated by the role of front-runner. But Duval
doesn't seem to care what anyone else does, and he refused to let
up after tying the course record Friday with a 63.
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent players made charges Saturday, including
Woods, whose 67 was the day's best round, as well as Funk and
Furyk, who both shot 68's. But Duval's steadiness was
extraordinary, as he refused to flinch despite the pursuit of the
pack. Seeing names climbing up the leader board only seemed to
increase Duval's concentration and intensity. And unless someone
catches Duval on Sunday, he will begin 1999 with a $468,000
first-place check and a new Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   For the contenders chasing Duval, Saturday's mission was to keep
him from running away. But most of the field seemed ready to
concede.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's threatening to run away with it,'' said Woods. ``I think
he should give me a stroke on each side. That way, I'd only be two
strokes back. My hat's off to him. You would think after shooting
10 under par yesterday, he might come out a little flat.'' Asked if
he looked at Duval as the player to beat right now, Woods said:
``Yeah, I do _ him, Mark O'Meara, Lee Westwood. You have to go into
tournaments looking at those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Funk managed to keep Duval from ending the day with an
even bigger advantage. With his wife, Sharon, caddying for him this
week, Funk has enjoyed this working vacation in Hawaii perhaps even
more than the other players. ``I don't have any history on this
course at all, other than having fun,'' said Funk, not a long
hitter but one of the tour's most accurate drivers. ``This course
has eaten me alive before. I'm just glad to finally play well
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But nobody has been better than Duval, who has seven victories
in his last 26 starts on tour. The more Duval wins, the more people
search for superlatives to describe his game, and many of his peers
believe that Duval is the world's best player right now. Asked
about that, Duval continued to be modest. ``When your peers would
even breathe something in those terms, it's flattering,'' said
Duval, who is ranked No. 3 in the world, behind Woods and O'Meara.
``You're talking about guys who have really worked hard and long
for many years to be exceptional. For them to say that about
another player, you have to take that in the highest regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day with a five-stroke lead over Singh, Funk and
Mayfair, Duval had another splendid day, although the increased
wind made the Kapalua Plantation Course play a little tougher.
Duval's round included six birdies and one bogey, and he never led
by fewer than four strokes. He birdied Nos. 5, 8. and 9 on the
front side, then birdied Nos. 12, 14 and 15 on the back side. His
only bogey came at No.16 after he had reached 22 under, but even if
the wind blows harder on Sunday, few seemed to expect Duval to
falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never say never, but he's in a zone right now,'' O'Meara said.
``David has great composure on the golf course. He is playing as
well as anyone in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   By winning two majors last year, the Masters and the British
Open, O'Meara was voted player of the year by his peers, although
Duval led the tour in victories last year with four. Duval has yet
to win a major, and that remains perhaps his primary goal for this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the type of year that could warrant player of the year,
but what Mark did was historical,'' Duval said. ``I didn't have a
historical year compared to his. I think because of that, he was
probably more deserving of player of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval won't have another chance to win a major until the Masters
in April. But in the meantime, he seems determined to keep winning
tournaments. And he will begin Sunday with an excellent chance to
win another.

ONE LIE MULTIPLIED BY 100 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
In the time it took to say, ``I do,'' the number of high-profile
politicians who should be prosecuted for the crime of perjury rose
by 100.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The alleged crime happened on live TV, although you didn't see
it.
</P>
<P>
   Like all sensible Americans, you quit watching anything that had
to do with impeachment months ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK, it's on tape.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the U.S. Senate stood in front of Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist last week.
</P>
<P>
   They had on dark suits and dark ties. They wore their dark
dispositions on their sleeves and raised their right hands to
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking clearly and sternly, the chief justice asked them, ``Do
you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of
the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, president of the
United States, now pending, you will do impartial justice according
to the Constitution and laws: So help you God.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a single one of them dropped his arm or faked a sneeze or
bent down to tie his shoe. None crossed his fingers behind his back
(Probably because there were cameras in the back of the room, too).
Instead, each senator answered, ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr is gonna need a whole lot more lawyers. &QL; 
PLENTY OF EVIDENCE
</P>
<P>
   All the evidence needed to prosecute the alleged perjurers is on
tape, and it's better than anything they've got on Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   None of the suspects tried to be coy.
</P>
<P>
   None tried to be evasive.
</P>
<P>
   None even asked the chief justice for the definition of
``impartial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' they said darkly, joining themselves in unholy
matrimony with the devil himself, then dragging the rest of us to
their wedding reception in hell.
</P>
<P>
   You've asked them to stop what they're doing and they do it,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   They have no choice, they say. The Constitution, which cannot be
ignored, commands them to hold an impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   You asked them to make the trial speedy and they drag it out.
They have no choice, they say. The Constitution cannot be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   You asked them to stop playing games, to stop acting like they
don't have all the information they need, to stop pretending they
haven't already made up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   They swear to God they are impartial. &QL; 
TAUNTING LIKE A BULLY
</P>
<P>
   They're like the bully who taunts a smaller, weaker kid by
repeating the last few words of everything he says, everything he
says. Sometimes, even using the torment to twist the argument their
way.
</P>
<P>
   You say, ``Under no circumstances do we want a long trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Want a long trial,'' they answer.
</P>
<P>
   You say, ``We'd prefer you didn't call many witnesses.''

</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to listen to sex talk . . .''

<P>
   It's one thing to go after a guy because he's a Democrat and
you're a Republican and you don't like him or what he stands for or
how he acts. It's different when you take an oath.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't get into trouble for wagging his finger and
saying on TV he didn't have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky. It's the stuff he said under oath that got him impeached.
</P>
<P>
   An oath very much like the one taken by senators last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the dictionary on my desk, the defi nition of ``impartial''
is: ``Favoring no one side or party more than another; without
prejudice or bias; fair; just.''
</P>
<P>
   The definition of ``perjury'' is: ``The willful telling of a lie
while under lawful oath or affirmation to tell the truth in a
matter material to the point of inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's Senate trial is just get ting started and
already there's a whole lot of lying going on.

RED STORM REGAINS CONFIDENCE AND ITS TOUCH
</HEADLINE>

 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps it was the abysmal shooting from the field.
Maybe it was the sense that St. John's had simply forgotten where
the rim was when standing at the line. Or was it St. John's
somnolence in its loss to Miami last week that stirred Mike Jarvis
before Saturday night's game against Seton Hall?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motive, Jarvis did a bit of coachly tinkering he
said he had been considering for a while, starting a smaller,
quicker, better-shooting group that had Tyrone Grant at center and
Reggie Jessie and Ron Artest at the forwards.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's snapped out of its slumber that had taken over the
Miami game, churning up and down the court with renewed vigor for
an 86-75 victory. Behind the all-around play of Ron Artest, who
finished with a triple-double (13 points, 12 rebounds and 10
assists) _ the first at St. John's since Mark Jackson, now of the
Indiana Pacers, did it during the 1985-86 season _ St. John's
opened a 20-point lead with 4:26 left in the first half and held
off a late charge by the Pirates. St. John's never trailed, and
played perhaps its finest half of the season, shooting 65.5 percent
from the field and outrebounding Seton Hall 22-11 in the first 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very impressive how hungry they were,'' Seton Hall
Coach Tommy Amaker said. ``They were creating havoc for us. We
couldn't guard them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-ranked Red Storm (13-3, 4-1) entered the game seeking a
measure of reassurance after last Wednesday's loss to Miami: that
its roll through the first part of the season wasn't an aberration,
that its ranking wouldn't soon be fodder for ridicule, that its
shooting touch hadn't abandoned the players just when the schedule
was getting treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   The first half gave the Red Storm and the 11,107 fans at Madison
Square Garden the answer. Seton Hall (10-5, 4-2), a team on the
rise in the Big East, had beaten St. John's in the Garden last
season and has already defeated then No. 12 Syracuse by 16 points
in the Carrier Dome. But the cross-Hudson rivalry that once was is
not back just yet.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's made sure this would not be another listless evening
when two unanswered first-half runs _ one of 7 points and another
of 13 _ put St. John's safely ahead, and provided great theater,
full of fast breaks and easy layups in the lane. Bootsy Thornton,
who finished with a game high 27 points, hit a 3-pointer (St.
John's had made just 5 of 23 in Miami), Artest rifled a bullet pass
underneath to Grant for an easy layup (they weren't so easy in
Miami when St. John's shot just 41.4 percent from the field) and
Erick Barkley led Thornton with an outlet pass that Thornton placed
in the basket for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were sharp with the offense, sharp on the break,'' Jarvis
said. ``They were really running. They were playing team
basketball. I don't know if it was the best half, but it was
close.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, in particular, had struggled in his last three games,
failing to deliver the play-making passes, losing his way at the
line, and getting into foul trouble. He picked up his third foul
with 4:49 left in the first half, but not before he launched a
gorgeous alley oop pass to Artest. Artest, who had an abysmal 6 of
15 performance against Miami, came back Saturday night with a
strong all-around performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't scoring a lot of points,'' Artest said, ``so I was
trying to do other things to help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the lead was up to 21 with 15:05 left in the game, St.
John's showed it is still vulnerable to a lapse of attention. And
when Barkley, seemingly the only player who can adequately guard
Seton Hall's superb point guard Shaheen Holloway, got his fourth
foul with 13:38 left and the lead at 17, the tightly-played game
began to unravel, and Seton Hall closed the lead to eight points
with 4:41 left. But Barkley returned intermittently (he finished
with 16 points, 11 from the foul line, and five assists), and when
Artest, standing near the baseline, passed out to Jessie at the
foul line, who found reserve guard Collin Charles (16 points),
inside for a layup the lead was back to 12 with 3:16 left.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm had gone off and another nap was over.

MOUNTAINEERING PROVES MUCH TO UCONN'S LIKING

<P>
   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. _ Connecticut had little to prove against West
Virginia Saturday night, but there were a few matters to address.
</P>
<P>
   There was the settlement of accounts. West Virginia was the last
team to defeat UConn in a Big East game.
</P>
<P>
   And the No. 1-ranked Huskies could show that they travel well.
Their plane to nearby Pittsburgh had been delayed more than 24
hours because of bad weather, denying the Huskies their routine of
arriving a day early and having a shoot-around the morning of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Huskies should hang out in airports more often.
Richard Hamilton scored 30 points as UConn ran past West Virginia,
80-45. Kevin Freeman added 14 for the Huskies (12-0, 5-0 Big East),
who stopped the Mountaineers' upset hopes from the start with
tenacious defense and opportunistic fast breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The UConn reserve guard Albert Mouring scored 11 points, and
Jake Voskuhl scored 8 points to go with his 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jarett Kearse was the only West Virginia player in double
figures, scoring 13 points. West Virginia (7-8, 2-4) made 6 of 19
free throws, but that was a small part of its shooting woes. The
Mountaineers were 17 of 58 (29.3 percent) from the field while the
Huskies were 30 of 57 (52.6 percent) and 12 of 14 (85.7 percent) at
the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton hit 5 of 10 3-point attempts and was 11 of 19 from the
field. West Virginia's best player, Marcus Goree, made just 4 of 13
shots in scoring 9 points, although he did have four blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia showed signs of improving on its laughable
shooting at the end of the first half, but Hamilton kept the
Mountaineers out of the game. He lofted in a 3-pointer, rolled in a
layup off Ricky Moore's steal and then drained another 3-pointer
off his own steal to give UConn a 44-19 lead early in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton gave the crowd something to cheer by missing a put-back
with UConn ahead by 50-22. But for most of the night, the Coliseum
faithful were rendered silent by the superior Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   UConn led by 55-28 with 9 minutes 53 seconds to go, and many
fans were wriggling into their parkas and leaving the arena.
</P>
<P>
   The game was a far cry from the teams' meeting last Feb. 6. That
night, UConn Coach Jim Calhoun yelled at Hamilton and Khalid
El-Amin as they returned to the bench while West Virginia was
upsetting the Huskies, 80-62. UConn has won 13 straight Big East
games since, and Saturday night the Huskies got their revenge on
the Mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, UConn will play host to Notre Dame while celebrating
its seventh week at No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies came into Saturday night leading the Big East in
scoring (86.7 points a game) and most other offensive categories.
But their defense did most of the work in staking them to a 34-17
lead at halftime. UConn played tight man-to-man, occasionally
trapping with up to three players in the front court. The
Mountaineers helped the visitors' cause with their wretched
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton hit two 3-pointers and a layup in guiding Connecticut
to a 16-4 lead. The Huskies then went through a stretch of 5:27
without a point, but West Virginia barely capitalized, making just
3 of 7 free throws. The Mountaineers would eventually go nearly 13
minutes without a field goal. Coach Gale Catlett substituted
furiously, trying to find anybody who would not make the basket
look the diameter of a thimble.
</P>
<P>
   The revolving-door approach did not work. The Huskies strung
together a 12-1 run to take a 28-8 lead with 3:45 left in the half.
At that point, West Virginia was shooting 10 percent (2 of 20) from
the field. Lionel Armstead made a 3-pointer with 3:40 to go that
brought sarcastic cheers from the fans. The basket inspired the
Mountaineers. After Hamilton, who scored 15 points in the first
half, sank three free throws to give UConn a 31-8 lead, the
Mountaineers received baskets from Kearse, Goree and Jamar Gaither
to outscore the Huskies by 6-3 in the last 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   That the Mountaineers could shoot 23 percent from the field and
40 percent (4 of 10) from the free-throw line and be down by just
17 points to the nation's top-ranked team must have been some sort
of consolation. But it was forgotten as the second half wore on.
