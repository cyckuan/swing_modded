 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ When David Robinson steppe out of his Navy dress
whites in 1989 and slipped on the silver and black of the San
Antonio Spurs, he had visions of a long string of NBA
championships.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was easy to see why.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs were young and stocked with talented players like
Terry Cummings, Rod Strickland, Willie Anderson and Maurice Cheeks,
and most everyone thought they were the team of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Well, everyone was right. The Spurs were the team of the future
_ the distant future.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of waiting, Robinson and the Spurs are finally on
the verge of their first NBA Finals appearance, playing the Knicks
in Wednesday's Game 1 at the Alamodome, and Robinson couldn't be
happier.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not exactly true. He would have been happy to have
had a few more shots at a title. But he's not complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we would develop a lot quicker, especially that
first team that we had,'' Robinson said. ``I thought, `This team,
if we keep it together, we'll be in the Finals real soon.' But that
didn't happen. So I'm real pleased with just being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson appears so giddy about his first Finals appearance that
he might be asking people to stop and pinch him. But that would
probably only serve to remind him of all the knocks he's suffered
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has been labeled as too soft. Too passive. Not
emotional enough. Too much of a goody-two-shoes ever to win it all
in the rough-and-tumble NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to wonder what they'll be saying about Robinson,
who is the only American player to play on three Olympic basketball
teams (including the original Dream Team) and was named one of the
NBA's 50 Greatest Players, should the Spurs win it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy has been an MVP, a first-team All-NBA and a
(first-team) All-Defense player, so all he has to do is win a title
this year, and he'd shut everybody up,'' said teammate Mario Elie,
who spent considerable portions of the early season verbally
hammering the passiveness out of Robinson. ``He can be a soft
player with a ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does Charles (Barkley) have to say? What does Karl
(Malone) have to say? Whoever all the tough guys are, all the
supposed enforcers, they don't have a ring. It's good to be an
enforcer, but if you don't have a banner, you haven't accomplished
anything. If Dave can put a banner up in San Antonio, what bad
thing are you going to say?
</P>
<P>
   ``He will have accomplished everything in his career. I think in
the back of his mind he wants to shut everybody up.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Robinson has been so eager to make way for Tim
Duncan. Many questioned Robinson's heart when he voluntarily
stepped aside to let Duncan become the No. 1 option in the Spurs'
low-post attack, but Robinson shakes his head as if everyone else
just doesn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson points to the fact that while he had the lowest scoring
average of his career (15.8 points to Duncan's 21.7), this has been
the Spurs' most successful season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing that draws all the attention, the numbers,''
Robinson said. ``But when you win, and you're a close-knit group,
then you need attitude. You need strength and a lot of things.
Those are the things I try to provide for the guys _ just a good,
solid balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know my energy defensively. The know that when things get
tough, they're looking at me. They're like, `Hey, we're down 15
points. What are you going to do?' So I know those are the areas I
need to be strong in, and going through a lot of the (negative)
things I've been through, it's helped me out.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he wants to help himself to a title.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and Duncan figure to be the focal points for the Spurs
since the Knicks are vertically challenged after losing starting
center Patrick Ewing to a torn left Achilles' tendon. All the
Knicks have in reserve are 6-11 Chris Dudley, 6-11 jumping jack
Marcus Camby and 6-11 Herb Williams, the oldest player in the
league at 41.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean plenty of opportunities inside for Robinson and
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an advantage in this series,'' Robinson said.``They
have some incredible shooting guards, and we have good big men, so
we have to take advantage of what we have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an advantage. We'll see. Obviously it (a height
disadvantage) hasn't hurt them too much. They're here with a 4-2
(series) win over a good team (the Indiana Pacers).''
</P>
<P>
   And after 10 days of waiting, Robinson is itching to get on the
floor and see just how good those Knicks are. And how good his
Spurs are.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is awesome,'' Robinson said. ``At certain levels, my team
has been the best. But finally, at this level, here's an
opportunity to have a team that's the best. I'm not a stranger to
it, but it just feels good to be in that position and have that
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying it already. I'm spending my afternoons with the
kids and then coming out here and enjoying this time. We've had a
lot of days here to let it all soak in. It's an opportunity that
doesn't come every day, so it's nice. We're preparing ourselves for
it the right way.''

HOLDSCLAW AND MYSTICS BEAT LIBERTY, 83-61 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time Chamique Holdsclaw played at Madison
Square Garden, she went two for nine and had nine rebounds. That
was last January when she was still a college senior playing for
the Tennessee Vols, who went on to defeat Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Holdsclaw made a triumphant return to her hometown
and the arena she admits she had hoped to play in as a pro, this
time as a heralded rookie with the Washington Mystics of the
Women's National Basketball Association. The butterflies were gone
and Holdsclaw's game _ the one her former coach, Pat Summitt,
predicted would return Monday night _ returned just in time to help
the Mystics muster their first victory of the season and hand the
Liberty its first loss.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Nikki McCray's game-high 24 points and Holdsclaw's 20
points and nine rebounds, the Mystics sailed to an 83-61 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely excited right now,'' Holdsclaw said. ``Number
one, we didn't expect to beat such a great team, especially such a
strong defensive team, but we didn't get down and it was great to
get that first win.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Darsch, who was fired as Liberty coach last year only to
end up in Washington, said the victory wasn't any sweeter coming
against her old team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bittersweet moment,'' said Darsch. ``Anytime you're 0
and 2, you're anxious to get that first win. We would have liked to
get it before our home crowd, but we'll take it where it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Holdsclaw, who was greeted to warm cheers from the 12,563
partisan crowd, Darsch was met with a smattering of boos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that's what I heard,'' she said with a shrug. ``I
don't know why they were booing. I didn't leave here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty, playing without Rebecca Lobo, who suffered a
season-ending knee injury in the opener last week, missed the
6-foot-4 center's presence in the low post, where they were
outrebounded 32-26. Sue Wicks, Kym Hampton and Theresa Weatherspoon
combined for 15 rebounds, but the team shot only 34 percent from
the field and played a loose, nervous game that never matched
Washington's intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a step slow in every situation,'' said Liberty coach
Richie Audabato. ``They were getting us on the board. We only shot
34 percent which was awfully tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Summitt telephoned Holdsclaw, the player who
helped her win three national championships, the third such call in
24 hours. ``I was concerned about her,'' explained Summit, an
analyst for ESPN. ``She's 0 and 2.'' Summitt's advice to Holdsclaw
was to play her game.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``post up, get inside the paint, take the
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Score over somebody,'' Summitt told her. Holdsclaw said her
former coach told her not to get depressed and to be the leader she
was capable of being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the job,'' she said Summit advised her.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that the WNBA is looking to Holdsclaw to do for
the league what Michael Jordan ultimately did for the NBA. Still,
she's just a rookie, and Holdsclaw said playing against veterans
like Weatherspoon and Houston's Cynthia Cooper, night after night,
has taken some adjustments from her college days. Some of the
Liberty players said they lost Monday night to a hungrier team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mystics played great, Chamique and Nikki played great,''
said Weatherspoon. ``But my main concern was about our intensity.
We didn't come and do it.''

YANKEES DEFEAT RANGERS, 8-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hideki Irabu dug at the mud around the pitcher's
rubber on Monday night to gather his footing. He wiped the
perspiration and rain off his face with his glove, gazed in at the
Texas Rangers and kept challenging them. It was a rigorous night
for Irabu, regardless of what his impressive statistics were. The
Rangers made Irabu work, Irabu worked relentlessly and the Yankees
won, 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   Before a gray afternoon turned into a soggy night at Yankee
Stadium, Manager Joe Torre spoke about how the Yankees needed to
see consistency from Irabu. Torre almost seemed to be pleading with
Irabu to end the mystery about his Jekyll-and-Hyde performances by
giving the Yankees the same steady effort every time he grips the
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Torre will definitely take a succession of reliable starts like
Monday night's from Irabu. The right-hander pitched seven innings
and permitted two runs on five hits. Toss in Chili Davis' three-run
homer and four runs batted in off Mark Clark and the Yankees, a
Jekyll-and-Hyde team themselves with an ordinary 6 victories in
their last 11 games, looked like the first-place team they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The byproduct of working hard is winning,'' Torre said. ``I
can't sell them on not being frustrated. I would rather have guys
who are frustrated than guys who say: `We're in first place. What
are you worried about?'''
</P>
<P>
   What made Irabu's second victory in three starts so rewarding to
the Yankees is how feisty and effective he was with runners on
base. Irabu uncorked 71 pitches through four innings and was not
overpowering. He had to be creative and he had to fight, which he
did in forcing the Rangers to go 0 for 10 with runners on base and
0 for 7 with runners in scoring position over the first five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   That is when it mattered the most because the Yankees followed a
49-minute rain relay in the fifth with four runs on run-scoring
singles from Davis and Jorge Posada and a two-run single from Scott
Brosius. It increased their lead to 8-0 and allowed everyone in
pinstripes to relax. Even Irabu, who struck out five, walked one
and was no mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be consistent,'' Torre said. ``I know it's a lot
to ask. We expect a lot of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu started toiling from the first batter as Mark McLemore
opened with a double to right field. But Irabu got Ruben Mateo to
squib back to him, then engaged in an eight-pitch duel with Rusty
Greer before striking him out on a split-finger fastball. When Juan
Gonzalez lined a bullet to third base, Irabu exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's two-run homer in the sixth was the only damage off
Irabu, who has allowed seven earned runs in the last 172/3 innings
while pitching decently in three straight starts.
</P>
<P>
   There were more minefields to avoid in the second, however, when
Rafael Palmeiro's single and Chuck Knoblauch's throwing error, the
second baseman's 11th of the season, put Rangers on first and
second. Again, Irabu remained calm. He struck out Todd Zeile on a
2-2 fastball and Knoblauch helped him out by snaring Lee Stevens's
grounder and starting a nifty double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers threatened again in the third after McLemore slapped
a one-out single and pilfered second, but Irabu induced Mateo to
pop out and pumped a 2-2 fastball past Greer, whom he whiffed three
times.
</P>
<P>
   Torre had canceled batting practice and told his players not to
show up until two hours before last night's game. He wanted them to
be rested after a long trip and wanted them to forget about
Sunday's dreadful 8-2 loss to the Marlins in Florida. When Torre
was asked if the listless Yankees were close to finding a groove,
he said, ``Not after yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe the Yankees were a bit closer after Monday night.
After Clark walked three batters in the first and the Yankees
managed one run on Tino Martinez's sacrifice fly, Davis stared at
Clark's 1-2 pitch and struck out with the bases filled. When he
batted with two out and two on in the third, however, Davis stayed
back on a 2-1 changeup and hammered it into the right field seats
for a three-run homer that put the Yankees in front, 4-0. Irabu
handled the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pulling for him,'' Torre said. ``Every start is
important. Not for any other reason than we want him to be
consistent. We're not trying to penalize him.''

WITH TENTATIVE PACT AVERTING STRIKE, TWA SHARES TAKE OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Shares of {Trans World Airlines} rose Monday
after the airline's weekend announcement of a tentative contract
agreement with the {Machinists} union.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's common stock was up and closed at 5 in heavy trading on
the American Stock Exchange. The stock was up more than 1 point at
one time during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted favorably after a month of uncertainty at the
St. Louis-based airline. TWA and the Machinists were in the midst
of a countdown toward a strike deadline. Last week, TWA workers
appeared to be voting down a previous contract proposal that union
negotiators had urged workers to reject.
</P>
<P>
   Now company and union officials are hoping TWA's 16,000
mechanics, flight attendants and passenger-service employees will
ratify the new contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we think it's good news,'' said Linda Bannister,
airline analyst with {Edward Jones}. ``I don't think management
would agree to a contract they can't afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the June 30 deadline approached without a tentative
agreement, TWA faced losing many travelers during the crucial
summer months, said David Levine, contributing editor of
/{PlaneBusiness/}, an industry financial newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both sides were feeling the pressure of what might
happen,'' he said. ``The union got a chance to let the members vent
their frustration by rejecting the company's proposal, and
management got to show stockholders that they took the process as
far as it could go.''
</P>
<P>
   Some reports have indicated that the contract will run for 18
months, an unusually short period for a labor agreement. Company
and union officials have declined comment. Details of the new
package are expected to be released today.

SPRINT NAMES FIRST MINORITY BOARD MEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Meeting in Paris over the weekend, Sprint
Corp.'s board of directors elected Louis W. Smith, president and
chief executive officer of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, to
the company's board.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, an African-American, is the first minority elected to
Sprint's board, which has 12 executives.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment comes as the company is being pressured to add
minorities and women to its boardroom and executive ranks and to
provide more opportunities to minority contractors in the
construction of its $750 million campus in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint officials acknowledge the need to promote diversity at
the company, but they say Smith's appointment has no connection to
recent discussions with the Coalition of Concerned Clergy or Jesse
Jackson's Rainbow//PUSH Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis Smith is an extraordinary businessman and outstanding
leader, recognized here in this city and across the country,'' said
Mark Bonavia, a Sprint spokesman. ``Those are the reasons why he
was selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speculation about any pressure relative to Mr. Smith's
election is dead wrong. Our board of directors' strategy is and
always will be to select the people that we need who possess proven
business and leadership skills. Lou Smith fits that description.''
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Kauffman Foundation, Smith worked for 29
years with AlliedSignal, retiring in 1995 as president of the
Kansas City division.
</P>
<P>
   He serves on the boards of H&AMP;R Block Inc., Western Resources
Inc., Commerce Bank of Kansas City, Midwest Research Institute and
the Civic Council of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was returning from Paris on Monday and could not be
reached for comment. But his appointment was applauded by local
minority groups involved in recent discussions with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou Smith will bring a new dimension to the board,'' said L.
Henderson Bell, president of the Coalition of Concerned Clergy in
Kansas City. ``He has a unique capacity to understand the civil
rights of business and the community. He's someone who understands
the tilt of the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has not yet been appointed to any board post or committee.
But Bonavia said the board probably would seek his input relative
to diversity issues.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint became a focus of minority groups' attention in February.
The Rev. Wallace Hartsfield was asked by a group of local minority
contractors to question Sprint about what the group considered a
lack of women and minorities being used to construct its new
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Those discussions gathered more steam last week when Jackson
came to Kansas City to raise money for his Rainbow//PUSH Coalition.
While in town, Jackson met with several Sprint executives to
discuss diversity issues and spoke with Sprint Chairman William T.
Esrey by phone.
</P>
<P>
   His coalition also bought $2,000 worth of stock in Sprint to
make it a part of Jackson's Wall Street Project, an effort to buy
stock in major corporations as a means of gaining access to those
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson started the project about a year ago at the national
level, and he is encouraging similar efforts in local communities.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the estimated $750 million it will cost to build the
Sprint campus, the company has committed to spending at least $40
million with businesses owned by minorities and women. So far, it
has reached $7 million in contracts with minority businesses.

SHAREHOLDERS DON'T SEEM BOTHERED BY CEO-WORKER SALARY GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, MO. _ An effort to tie CEO pay more closely to
average worker salaries met with limited support at eight corporate
annual meetings this spring.
</P>
<P>
   {United for a Fair Economy}, a Boston-based organization that is
trying to reduce the pay gap between top executives and their
employees, reported Friday that more than 500 million shareholder
votes were cast in favor of gap-shrinking resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, all of the resolutions failed by wide margins.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest support for pay equalization came from shareholders
of {R.R. Donnelley}, which met in March. A resolution on gender-
and race-based pay equity received 16.6 percent of the vote at the
printing company.
</P>
<P>
   The Fair Economy organization selected the eight corporations as
those where corporate leaders received large pay increases while
rank-and-file jobs were being cut.
</P>
<P>
   At seven of the corporations, Fair Economy-backed resolutions
called for CEO pay to be tied to a multiple of the lowest-paid
worker's pay at the company. The seven companies and the vote
percentages:
</P>
<P>
   {AlliedSignal}, 12 percent for and 88 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   {AT&AMP;T}, 7.6 percent for and 92.4 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   {BankAmerica}, 6.7 percent for and 93.3 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   {BankBoston}, 4.8 percent for and 95.2 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   {Citigroup}, 10.8 percent for and 89.2 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   {General Electric}, 5 percent for and 95 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   {Huffy}, 8.3 percent for and 91.7 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholder resolutions were sponsored by Responsible
Wealth, a project of United for a Fair Economy that is a network of
more than 400 affluent Americans who are concerned about economic
inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Responsible Wealth spokesmen said they were not dispirited by
the vote percentages in favor of their pay-equity resolutions. They
said annual meeting voting procedures typically favored management
in proxy voting.
</P>
<P>
   Responsible Wealth spokesmen also said they were glad to have
started a dialogue on the pay issue. Management at AT&AMP;T,
BankAmerica and BankBoston issued statements acknowledging that
growing pay gaps were a social and business problem.
</P>
<P>
   The group intends to continue its efforts in August by
introducing a shareholder resolution at Computer Associates' annual
meeting. Next year, it intends to resubmit resolutions at several
of the corporations and do more resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Members also are pledging to push mutual fund managers to
disclose their proxy voting records, something that typically is
kept secret by most mutual funds.

<P>
   TOKYO _ South Korean naval forces sank a North Korean torpedo
boat Tuesday as a fierce gun battle erupted in the Yellow Sea, and
South Korea put its entire armed forces on combat level of alert.
</P>
<P>
   Another North Korean vessel was sinking and it appeared to be
towed away by its comrade ships.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's sinking of the ship abruptly intensified the
confrontation in the disputed waters of the Yellow Sea, and it is
not clear how North Korea will respond.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the firing broke out, talks to resolve the nine-day
crisis between North Korean officials and the U.N. Command began
Tuesday morning in the demilitarized zone, Panmunjum.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's battle is the most serious setback in relations
between the two sides since December 1998, when South Korean forces
sunk a spy submarine that had intruded deeply into South Korean
waters. It is sure to aggravate the already strained relations
between North Korea and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea said it fired in reaction to shots fired by North
Korean torpedo boats in the disputed waters, rich crab-fishing
grounds where the two navies had been taunting each other for days.
</P>
<P>
   An official with South Korea's armed forces, who spoke on the
condition he not be identified, said the South's naval vessels were
trying to prevent enemy vessels from heading to the south. In the
process, they fired on a North Korean torpedo ship and hit the
boat's generator cabin, which caught on fire. The vessel then sank.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange of fire lasted nearly 30 minutes, according to
Korean news reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``In response to firing by the North Korean navy, our naval
vessels fired immediately, according to military regulations,''
said Col. Hwang Dong-kyu, spokesman for South Korea's Joint Chiefs
of Staff. ``We have placed all naval forces in the area on combat
alert status.''
</P>
<P>
   Combat alert is a state of emergency below a state of war.
</P>
<P>
   Cha Young-kuk, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense
Department, said: ``One North Korean rescue boat was half-sunk and
one small North Korean patrol boat has sunk.''
</P>
<P>
   A high-speed South Korean patrol boat fired .76 mm rounds at the
North Koreans, Hwang said, adding that South Korea was ``taking
measures to contain the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's government-owned Yonhap News Agency quoted a local
fisherman in a small village as saying that he had heard an
explosion at about 9:25 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea said seven sailors were slightly injured and that
one of its boats was partially immobilized. ``One high-speed patrol
boat received some damage and one patrol boat has been partially
immobilized due to damages in the generator room, but this has not
posed serious damages in terms of mobility,'' Cha said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean patrol boats had intruded early Monday morning into
the disputed waters south of the effective demarcation line
separating the countries' waters. The North does not recognize the
line, but it has never challenged it this openly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The armistice ending the 1950-53 Korea War, signed by the U.N.
Command and North Korea, never outlined the maritime border off the
Korean peninsula's central western coast.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Command unilaterally demarcated the sea frontier in
1953 and created a buffer zone south of it to avoid armed clashes.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, North Korean boats, armed with torpedoes, apparently
surfaced near the disputed area, but no shots were fired. The U.N.
Command, led by U.S. military officers and supported by 37,000
American troops stationed in South Korea, then called upon North
Korea to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea agreed to talk to U.N. military officials as part of
an effort to resolve the increasingly belligerent confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few days, South Korean patrol boats had been
defending the line by ramming into at least three North Korean
vessels, as rising tensions have forced South Korea's Defense
Ministry to order warships to the area in a show of force. South
Korea has asked the United States to put some of its forces on
alert.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea also put its army on alert, telling servicemen that
they were not to fire unless they were fired upon first. They were
explicitly warned by Navy chief Adm. Lee Soo Yong not to ``concede
even an inch of our territories.''
</P>
<P>
   The last bitter military confrontation between the two Koreas
took place in December 1998, when a North Korean submarine intruded
deep into South Korean waters and was then sunk by South Korean
forces in a firefight just off South Korea's southern coast. A team
of four North Koreans fled the submarine, spawning a long man-hunt
for the spies. All but one of them were shot during the search by
South Korean forces.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. command forces in South Korea said that
it was closely watching the situation, but that it had not changed
the status of its forces by putting them on any special alert.

MURRAY HAS EYE FOR DETAIL, PASSION FOR THE GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Immaculately dressed in dark-blue suit, starched
white shirt and gold tie, his graying hair only a few misplaced
strands shy of Jimmy Johnson perfection, the Los Angeles Kings' new
coach had his coming-out party Monday and appeared every bit the
detail fiend he's purported to be.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Andy Murray looked the part, and during a media
gathering near the Staples Center construction site, he did nothing
to dispel the workaholic image he brings with him after 20-plus
years as a career coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain variables you can control,'' the 48-year-old
Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very prepared,'' general manager Dave Taylor said. ``He
had a lot of knowledge of our team. He came in prepared for the
interview and I was very impressed throughout. It wasn't just what
I knew about him. I made a lot of calls. I didn't hear one bad word
about him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Murray arrived for his initial interview, he brought
printed breakdowns on Kings players, a statistical analysis of the
dreary 1998-99 season, and a plan that included speaking to each
player on the team, visiting some in their homes in North America
and abroad, and conditioning objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Attention to detail? Murray a former Canadian national team
coach who spent this season at a Minnesota prep school, said he
wants to send flowers to each of the players' wives on the first
day of training camp to remind them of their importance to the
Kings' success.
</P>
<P>
   There's no word on whether Robinson resorted to such niceties.
But calling FTD will be the easy part. The hard part will be
improving a team that allowed too many shots on goal last season
while struggling at the other end of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll play a hard-working defensive game,'' Murray said. ``I
want the players, when they don't have the puck, to know their
responsibilities. But when they have the puck, I want them to be
creative, because that's what the fans want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray also will need to shore up team discipline. Captain Rob
Blake and left wing Luc Robitaille criticized Robinson last season
for not being firm with teammates who weren't performing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy's not working, why is he playing?'' Robitaille said.
``... With this coach, I think that's going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake played for Murray two years ago when Canada won a gold
medal at the World Championships, and said he expects the Kings'
new coach to be tougher than the old one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's not fit to do that,'' Blake said. ``Andy uses a lot
of words like `passion.' But he really believes in that and the
players will buy into it.'' Asked if he felt prepared to discipline
highly paid professional athletes, Murray said, ``I didn't need
this job. I wanted this job. I find there's nothing worse as a
coach after lack of success than to say, `I didn't do it my way.' I
don't know how not to challenge the players to be the best they can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned about his stint at the high school level, Murray said
he was refreshed by spending the year working with enthusiastic
young players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership,'' Murray said, ``is all about getting people to do
what you want them to do because they want to do it.''

`PHANTOM' SHOWS US THE DARK SIDE, AND IT IS US

<P>
   The critics have spoken: ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom
Menace'' is a farce, a violent travesty, a waste of digitized
footage.
</P>
<P>
   If the world wasn't sure that George Lucas had spent his last
iota of talent long ago, it is now. And Lucas' latent racist
tendencies are on full display with that Jar Jar Binks _ a Stepin
Fetchit for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like me _ and the Force informs me that most of you
are _ you don't give a Jawa's heinie what critics say. You've long
since realized that the vast majority of professional film
reviewers are agents of the Empire _ or at least aspire to be.
</P>
<P>
   I say enough. It's high time the overwrought lemonheads who have
been slamming ``Phantom Menace'' pony up a quarter and buy a clue.
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of all people who don't watch films by looking past
their nostrils, I feel compelled to speak up on behalf of ``Phantom
Menace'' and its troupe of intergalactic misfits.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason some people loathe the ``Star Wars'' films so,
quite simply, is that the entire philosophical outlook of the
series is inimical to them. The old theme of good vs. evil is
perpetually recycled by Hollywood hacks, but when a director like
Lucas gets hold of it, revitalizes it and makes it resonate, it
becomes a challenge to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: We are not a society that rises swiftly to meet
the attack of evil. We're more inclined to rationalize our misdeeds
than face up to why they might be wrong. Just ask the guy in the
Oval Office _ he knows that number by heart.
</P>
<P>
   If Darth Maul were a real person, it's not difficult to see
people defending him as not evil, only ``differently socialized.''
Without a doubt, he would be a celebrity, and probably a
politician.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, seduction by evil is very much what the ``Star
Wars'' series is about. Giving in to evil is very much what our
culture is about.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that for a moment. What does Yoda tell us are the
tools of the Dark Side?
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Anger. Think abusive bosses. Think talk shows. Think
parents beating their kids. Think gangsters. Think Columbine High
School.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Fear. Consider the reasons underlying Neighborhood Watch.
Or handgun legislation. Or gated communities. I have a lock on my
door _ how about you?
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Aggression. Ever yell at someone for cutting in front of
you in line? How about while driving? Have you gotten even lately
or tried to put someone in his place?
</P>
<P>
   And what's the ultimate goal of the Dark Side? Darth Vader tells
several times: Power. Luke Skywalker may not have sought the power
of the Dark Side, but we would like to. Ever thought about climbing
the corporate ladder? That's a desire for power. Have you ever
tried to accumulate more money? That's a kind of power. Who are our
cultural ``heroes'' these days? Generally not people who give of
themselves, but people who have ``made it,'' i.e., who have gotten
the wealth and success _ the power _ we wish we had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' has struck many a nerve because it shows us
the antithesis of what we are. One of the themes of ``Phantom
Menace'' is innocence, the opposite of the corruption represented
by the Dark Side of the Force.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the story is deliberately told with a very
childlike point of view, embodied by the heroes Anakin ``Spinning
is a Good Trick'' Skywalker, Queen Amidala and the allegedly
offensive Jar Jar Binks, who by temperament if not age is a klutzy
preteen goofball. (If you think he's a racist caricature, then
answer this question: Which ethnic group has historically been
portrayed as 7-foot tall trachodons with floppy bunny ears and bell
bottom pants?)
</P>
<P>
   If Jar Jar, Amidala and Anakin are difficult for some people to
relate to, it's because we are not very much like them. We're more
akin to the evil Trade Federation _ true Yankee traders if ever
there were such in space.
</P>
<P>
   The droid army is the very image of the perfect capitalist
corporation _ run by identical, efficient, unquestioning automatons
that can overpower all opposition. You can almost imagine the
battle droids with Microsoft and Nike logos on the sides of their
heads and droning, ``Obey your thirst. Obey. Obey!'' as they march
over some helpless community of nonconsumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' is a well-crafted film. It makes some folks
uncomfortable because accepting it on its own terms means looking
at ourselves. If George Lucas did not set out to create a social
commentary, the virulence and bitterness of critics has provided it
for him as they let loose their own anger and aggressive impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Anakin Skywalker is the innocence each of us once had. Darth
Vader is the person many of us would like to become: fear-inspiring
lords of the greedy Empire. We are our own phantom menace.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Luke Skywalker when you need him?

ENERGY EAST SET TO ACQUIRE CMP GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, N.Y.) (sw) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Energy East Corp., the parent company of the New York State
Electric and Gas Corp., will acquire the CMP Group, the parent
company of Central Maine Power, in a transaction valued at $957
million, the companies said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which was scheduled to be announced on
Tuesday, Energy East will acquire all 32.4 million common shares of
the CMP Group for $29.50 a share in cash and assume $271 million in
preferred stock and long-term debt.
</P>
<P>
   The merger will bring together two major utilities in the
Northeast, a region in which most states are deregulating utilities
to give customers a choice of suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   This has put great pressure on utilities to find merger partners
so that they can increase the size of their service areas and cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Electric serves 820,000 electric customers and
240,000 natural gas customers in upstate New York and employs
4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Central Maine serves 530,000 electric customers in central and
southern Maine, which contains three- quarters of the state's
population. The utility employs 1,800 workers.
</P>
<P>
   David T. Flanagan, the president and chief executive officer of
the CMP Group, said that while there might be a reduction of some
traditional utility jobs as a result of the merger at Central Maine
Power, there would also be opportunities to create new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   While CMP will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy East
it will keep its corporate headquarters in Augusta, Maine. Flanagan
will be chairman, president and chief executive of the CMP Group
after the merger and will also become president of Energy East,
which is based in Ithaca, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Welsley W. von Schack, the chairman, president and chief
executive of Energy East, said in an interview on Monday that
``we're trying to create a new company that will be a leading
energy distribution company in the Northeast and that will have the
size to give customers a new array of products and services.''
</P>
<P>
   As states such as New York and Maine deregulate, they have
required that their utilities sell off power plants and become
transmission companies that deliver power and natural gas to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Energy East and CMP have sold off their generating plants.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulated utilities have also been seeking ways to market
services such as energy audits and ways of making factories, retail
outlets and homes more energy efficient. Some are also seeking to
get into the telecommunication business.
</P>
<P>
   Energy East, for example, announced in April that for $617
million in cash it was acquiring the Connecticut Energy Corp.,
whose subsidiary, the Southern Connecticut Gas Co., delivers gas to
160,000 customers in southern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Energy East stock closed at $26.25, up 6.25 cents, in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. CMP stock was unchanged, closing at
$20.625, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Energy East has
been buying back its stock purchasing nearly 10 million shares. Von
Schack said that the merger would not affect its stock repurchase
program.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan said that both utilities had worked together in the
past and therefore already had ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've dated before we tied the knot,'' he added.

MURRAY BRINGS FRESH PERSPECTIVE TO KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was 70 degrees in the shade Monday in L.A.'s
concrete city center, the kind of weather that leaves Angelenos
salivating for iced tea, maybe, but certainly not ice hockey.
Whoever says there is no change of seasons in Southern California
cannot be a sports fan. Just try selling us on the NHL in June. You
might as well be pitching open-toed sandals to Minnesotans in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo versus Dallas in the Stanley Cup Finals? Please. Our
neighbor's yard sale attracted more interest locally over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Into this abyss strode Andy Murray, looking amazingly crisp for
someone battling the heat and jet lag and indifference toward any
new coach in town not named Phil Jackson. He began to speak, this
man who just had been handed the job that had turned Larry
Robinson's hair gray, and his words hit his audience in the
downtown office building like a blast of air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   People sat up a little straighter in their seats. There were
murmurs of approval _ one guy whispered loud enough for one whole
side of the room to hear, ``He speaks very well.'' And it was true.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd that only hours before had thought Anne was the only
Murray of any note to come out of Canada, sat transfixed as he
stood in the sweltering room, dripping passion while everyone else
sprouted beads of sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes into his first speech as the Kings' head coach, it
was obvious why general manager Dave Taylor was sold on this man
with no previous NHL head-coaching experience. Suddenly it didn't
seem at all a stretch to picture this man who had spent the past
season coaching at a prep school in Minnesota directing the Kings
into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake will be riding shotgun on this venture and he couldn't
be more comfortable. The Kings' captain and star defenseman stood
in the back of the room, grinning, as Murray's intensity washed
over the room, transforming everyone it touched.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the first time Blake has seen Murray turn skeptics
into apostles with one fiery address. In 1997, one of Murray's
motivational speeches convinced Blake to represent Canada in the
World Championships. Another one of Murray's talks coalesced the
hastily thrown-together band of patriots, who then went out and won
the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was up there speaking, I could see people in the room
were responding to his passion,'' Blake said. ``I looked over at
(teammate) Luc (Robitaille) and he was feeding off Andy's
intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   It should surprise no one that Murray talks with the zeal of an
army recruiting officer. For three years he was one, in a manner of
speaking. From 1996 to 1998 he scoured the plains of Canada and the
outposts of the NHL, looking for a few good men to carry the Maple
Leaf flag into battle.
</P>
<P>
   Murray served on the coaching staff of Team Canada during the
1996 World Cup of Hockey and the 1998 Olympics in Nagano and in
between ran the Canadian National Team like an arm of the military.
</P>
<P>
   When Murray said of the Kings, ``We expect to be a disciplined,
energetic, hard-working team,'' bet on it. His teams tend to be as
good as his word.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings may not challenge Dallas right away for Western
supremacy. But they won't skate like they did far too many nights
en route to missing the playoffs with a 32-45-5 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get from people that which you expect of them,'' Murray
said. ``I'll never question a player's pride. But I may at times
question his work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, 48, has been coaching long enough to have figured out
that players, stripped of their pretensions and paychecks, are just
big kids at heart. Like his own three children, his players might
think they know what's best for themselves and occasionally
challenge authority. But deep down it's discipline and direction
they crave.
</P>
<P>
   So he won't insult them by giving them sovereignty and control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we know how to prepare,'' Blake said, chuckling.
``I'm probably the worst at saying we don't need to watch video,
let's just go out and play the game. You won't get anyone cutting
corners like that with Andy. He'll install discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players will question him at first. But I don't think
anybody's going to stray. If they do, there'll be consequences to
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   To which we say, hallelujah, Lord have mercy. It's about time
somebody held the players accountable. If nothing else, he brings
to the job a fresh perspective. After years of the same stale
results, that's as welcome as a summer breeze.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
It's only June, right?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somebody forgot to tell the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton pitched seven strong innings and Craig Biggio had
three doubles Monday night as the Astros pounded the Atlanta Braves
10-4 in an early-season meeting of National League division
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, playing without manager Larry Dierker for the first
time this season, extended their winning streak to four games and
tied the best start in club history after 61 games (38-23).
</P>
<P>
   Dierker will undergo brain surgery today after suffering a
seizure in the dugout during Sunday's game with San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the questions everybody asked was how we were going to
bounce back from yesterday's adversity,'' interim manager Matt
Galante said. ``I think you saw the kind of makeup this club has.
We've bounced back from adversity all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio were among
players, coaches and management personnel to visit Dierker at
Methodist Hospital. As a tribute to their stricken manager,
Dierker's No. 49 jersey hung in the Astros' dugout during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry has done a lot of good things for people here, and we
are going to continue to hang it everywhere we go until he
returns,'' Biggio said. ``We're going to dedicate the rest of the
season to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros broke open a 4-3 game with a four-run sixth inning to
send the Braves to their fourth straight defeat. Atlanta, reeling
from a 22-1 loss to Baltimore on Sunday, has been outscored 32-5 in
the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who won for the eighth time in his last nine decisions,
held the Braves to three runs and seven hits in seven innings. He
struck out five and walked one in extending his lifetime record to
4-1 against Atlanta in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   In his last 10 starts, Hampton is 7-1 with a 2.49 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (8-2) said his thoughts during the game were with
Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was definitely on my mind,'' Hampton said. ``We just want
him to get well and back to being the old Larry. We're just going
to try and go from here and do what he wanted _ for us to beat the
Braves. I think we really wanted this game for him and to continue
playing well in his absence.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Astros' offensive highlights: Derek Bell drove in
three runs, Bagwell hit his 21st homer, Carl Everett went 4-for-5
and Biggio increased his major-league-best doubles total to 29.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros wasted little time jumping on lefthander Odalis
Perez, striking for two runs in the first. Biggio led off with a
double and, after two walks, scored on Bell's infield grounder.
Richard Hidalgo's sacrifice fly made it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez sliced the lead to 2-1 in the second, sending
Hampton's first pitch of the inning over the left-field wall. Lopez
added an RBI double in the eighth off reliever Jay Powell.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Javy hit that home run, I blamed it on Larry,'' Hampton
joked. ``That was his home run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros pushed the lead back to two in the second inning when
Everett led off with a single and scored three batters later on a
grounder by Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta pulled back within one run in the fourth inning as
Biggio made just his third error of the season. With two outs,
Biggio mishandled a grounder by Lopez, and Andruw Jones followed
with a triple to make the score 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But every time the Braves scored, the Astros had a response. In
the fourth, Tony Eusebio walked, Tim Bogar singled and Biggio's
second double scored Eusebio.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta threatened in the sixth when Chipper Jones led off with
a single and Brian Jordan's double cut the lead to 4-3. With nobody
out, Hampton got the next three hitters to ground out, including
two to shortstop Ricky Gutierrez, as the Braves stranded the
potential tying run at third base.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros put the game away in the sixth by sending nine
batters to the plate against Perez and reliever Kevin McGlinchy.
Hampton walked, and then the Astros took batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio hit his third double, and two batters later Bagwell was
intentionally walked to load the bases. Bell followed with a
two-run single to left, giving him seven RBIs in the last two
games. Hidalgo and Everett followed with run-scoring singles to put
the Astros ahead 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell added a home run off John Rocker to lead off the eighth.
Of Bagwell's 21 home runs, Monday's was his third at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Perez allowed six runs and seven hits over five innings. He
struck out five and walked seven (one intentionally). During the
past two games, Braves starting pitchers have surrendered 13 runs
and 14 hits in 7 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are 15-3 against lefthanders this season.
</P>
<P>
   Trever Miller pitched the last 1 innings for his first save,
lowering his ERA to 1.98.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job to stay ready, no matter if I have a hundred days
off,'' said Miller, who hadn't pitched since June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was against the Braves or any other team, Monday's
victory was a much-needed lift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you face the Braves, you know you're in for a
battle,'' Galante said.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker's absence marked the first time he had missed a game as
manager in two years. He missed two games May 21-22, 1997, after
the death of his father, Charles. The Astros went 1-1 with Bill
Virdon as interim manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the news from the hospital really picked us up,''
Galante said. ``I think we had good news, after we probably
expected worse than it was. We were able to talk about it, and we
all felt a lot better.''

LONG BEACH STATE'S MAY NAMED TOP FEMALE ATHLETE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Misty May's perfect season got a little
more perfect Monday night when the Long Beach State volleyball star
was awarded the Honda-Broderick Cup, given annually to the top
female athlete in collegiate sports.
</P>
<P>
   May, a two-time national player of the year who this season
helped the 49ers become the first team in women's volleyball to
ever go undefeated in winning national championship, was presented
the award at a dinner in Reno, Nev., where the National Association
of Collegiate Directors of Athletics convention is being held.
</P>
<P>
   Past winners include soccer player Mia Hamm, heptathlete Jackie
Joyner-Kersee and basketball players Cheryl Miller, Ann Meyers,
Chamique Holdsclaw and Rebecca Lobo.
</P>
<P>
   May is only the second volleyball player to win the award since
its inception 23 years ago and the first since Deitre Collins of
Hawaii won the honor in 1983. She is also the second area athlete
to win the award, joining UCLA softball player Lisa Fernandez, a
St. Joseph High graduate who was given the award in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   May, who arrived in Reno late Monday afternoon from Colorado
Springs, Colo., where she was practicing with U.S. national team,
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State coach Brian Gimmillaro, who joined May for the
presentation, was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a win for the school, for Misty, for the volleyball
program, for the whole city,'' Gimmillaro said. ``What she's done
for our sport and how she's represented our school, she's certainly
deserving of this. She's been the Wayne Gretzky or Magic Johnson of
our sport she's a person who revolutionized the position (of
setter).''
</P>
<P>
   May, widely considered the top high school player in the country
at Newport Harbor High, lived up to even the great expectations she
brought to Long Beach State four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly demonstrated that just because she was a deft
passer, it didn't preclude her from becoming a force blocking,
spiking or serving roles often left to middle blockers or outside
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   May became the fourth 49er to win national player of the year
honors joining Tara Cross, Antoinette White and Danielle Scott and
led Long Beach State to final four appearances her last two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   She ended her 49er career with a flourish, setting a record with
20 service aces during the tournament and posting 70 assists, 11
digs, nine kills and four blocks in the title match against Penn
State. She was chosen MVP of the final four as Long Beach State
concluded its season 36-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We planned it like this, but it doesn't always go the way it's
planned,'' Gimmillaro said of his expectations for May. ``She had a
special personality and a special way that she viewed the game and
played the game. She used to come to our camp and the way she
listened and interpreted the information was very unique. I
believed there wouldn't be any limits on her ability to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State assistant coach Debbie Green, the setter on the
U.S. national team in the 1984 Olympics and long considered the
best this country has produced at the position, worked with May for
four years. She says May never stopped wanting to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of players in the country that when they go into
college have the potential to be the best,'' said Green, a finalist
for the award in 1978 while she played at USC. ``She made it
simple. She's so athletic and understands the game so well and I
didn't have to motivate her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day in practice she'd go hard and every day she was
willing to hear input, even up until the final practice at the
final four. She was always making adjustments and never made me
feel like, `I already know this.' ''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FIRST of all, let's get something straight here. There is no such
thing as minor brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Although Larry Dierker's condition isn't believed to be
life-threatening and he was joking Monday about returning to the
dugout in a couple weeks, it's possible he won't be back at all in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The operation he'll undergo early this morning _ called a
craniotomy _ will take at least three hours and will be very
invasive. I'll spare you the gruesome details, but it's safe to say
you won't see Dierker out in public for a while without his ball
cap on. Good thing he's accustomed to wearing one.
</P>
<P>
   However, the prognosis for his full recovery is excellent. It's
practically guaranteed, barring unanticipated complications. He'll
manage again, assuming he wants to, and we must assume he will.
Dierker doesn't consider baseball to be work. For him, going to the
ballpark happens to be the same thing as stopping to smell the
flowers. He didn't need to learn any lessons in perspective. He was
already an expert on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   How many baseball managers do you know who are aspiring
novelists and songwriters, who are wont to ponder their place in
the grand scheme of things, who appreciate a fine bottle of wine
and who eagerly jump at a friend's invitation to attend a
performance of the Carmina Burana _ without first asking what
position Burana plays?
</P>
<P>
   Also, people with Dierk's makeup tend to heal quickly because of
their mindset. They have fun and live expansively, and they don't
sweat the details, except the very few that really matter.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, that's why Dierker is such a good manager. And that's
why he leaves the Astros in such good stead, possessing the
glossiest record in the National League despite a procession of
on-field injuries and off-field maladies. He lets his players do
what they do best, with no dissonant, ``me``-driven interference.
And his interim replacement, Matt Galante, seems certain to do
likewise.
</P>
<P>
   Side by side, Dierker and Galante may be Mutt and Jeff, but they
process information in almost exactly the same way. Matty was as
much a right-hand man to Larry as a man can be. The Astros have a
tremendous confidence in Galante and also a deep, longstanding
affection for him. It's a tribute to everybody in the clubhouse _
coaches, players and the stricken skipper himself _ that Dierker
shouldn't be missed at all.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, as a person. You can replace the manager. You
can't replace the person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just keeping Dierk's seat warm,'' says Galante, a guy who
has long wanted, and deserved, to be a manager _ but never under
circumstances such as these. ``Let's get Larry better. Let's add to
the (division) lead he left us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, I'm thinking day-to-day only. If it's for a short time,
fine. If it's for a longer time, that's fine, too. All that matters
is that Larry gets well and, while he's getting well, we carry on
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Galante admits he won't soon forget seeing Dierker collapse onto
the floor of the dugout Sunday, then begin to convulse. Grand mal,
the kind of seizure he suffered, means big and bad. It was both.
</P>
<P>
   One moment Dierker and Galante were rising, almost in unison, to
watch Derek Bell's grand slam clear the fence. Practically the next
moment, Dierker's neurons were misfiring crazily. His arms and legs
were thrashing about while vomit spewed from his mouth, choking
him. Had he been driving a car or crossing a busy street instead of
merely managing a ballclub, he'd probably be dead today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared me to death,'' Galante said. ``I've never been so
scared in all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   So, no, taking charge of the Astros won't be any big deal. Matty
knows them. They know him. As the boss, he can't always be their
best buddy, but hopefully they can handle that and accept the
occasional tough decision he must make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with these same people for many years,'' Galante
said. ``They're quality players, quality people. You saw that in
how they reacted (Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to keep playing hard. They'll handle the
transition like they've handled everything else that's happened to
us.''
</P>

   Like having the entire left side of their starting lineup and
the catcher go down _ plus losing two coaches to boot. Yet here
they were Monday night, having to again pick up the pieces against
Atlanta's NL team-of-the-decade Braves, leading the East as per
usual. And who, worse, came to town having been humiliated 22-1 the
previous night in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to want to take it out on us tonight,'' Galante
mused before his debut. ``Bad timing, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was the Astros acting as though they intended to
one-up the Orioles, loading the bases on Odalis Perez before he got
his first out. They would score 10 runs before the evening wrapped,
six more than the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Galante is 1-0. Now, hopefully, Dierker adds an easy ``W''
today.

BLOWOUT, BUT NO CANDLES  
 LOSS SPOILS MER CURY BIRTHDAY PARTY PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - What began as a birthday party ended in a wake Monday
night as the Mercury bombed in its home opener, losing for the
second time in three days to the Sacramento Monarchs, 74-64.
</P>
<P>
   The birthday girl, 35-year-old Jennifer Gillom, produced a
double-double, but her 29 points were 16 more than the rest of the
starting lineup combined as Phoenix drops to 0-2 for the first time
in its three-year existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to apologize to the fans of Phoenix for that display of
bad basketball,'' said Mercury Coach Cheryl Miller. ``That was
embarrassing. It was humiliating. They took that momentum (from a
96-85 win Saturday), brought it here and pulled out a can of
whoop-ass and got the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that was good was the final buzzer and us
getting off the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who missed much of training camp because of her
broadcasting obligations, took responsibility for her team's lack
of effort and promised changes before Saturday's game against
winless Cleveland (0-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my team, they're a reflection of me, and I let this
organization down,'' she said. ``I take all the blame for what
happened out there. That's my fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played soft. I've been coaching soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone forget in the rush to mea culpa, Sacramento (2-1)
had something to do with the wreck. Four players reached
double-figure scoring as the Monarchs refused to crack before a
crowd of 13,228 and ghosts of its 0-8 1997-98 past vs. the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4 Yolanda Griffith was nowhere near the offensive
force that she was on Saturday, scoring 13 instead of 31, but
hauled down 18 of Sacramento's 37 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yolanda's the biggest threat in the league so far,'' said
Bridget Pettis, who had 16 points off the bench and was the
Mercury's only producer aside from Gillom. ``She's a very talented
young lady. She can bring the ball down the court, offensive
rebounding like the men. She makes some tips from 10-15 feet out,
that's something rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix never led, trailed 35-29 at halftime and was hit by a
17-5 run early in the second half in falling behind, 53-38, with
11:16 remaining. From then on, the Mercury got no closer than nine
(58-49), taking 12 more shots than the Monarchs, but shooting just
37.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The starting perimeter of Michele Timms, Edna Campbell and
Clarissa Davis-Wrightsil went 0 for 14 until Campbell hit a
three-pointer with 7:35 left.
</P>
<P>
   Davis-Wrightsil went scoreless and got just 10 minutes of
playing time as Pettis played 27 minutes. It was Pettis, coming in
at 10-4, who hit a three-pointer and layup on an assist by Gillom
then dove to the floor to tie up Ticha Penicheiro and bring
something of a recognizable look to the 1998 WNBA runner-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the jelling process,'' Pettis said. ``We made
some crucial cuts (former starters Umeki Webb and Toni Foster)
before the season started, and everybody was in shock a little bit.
But we've got to work with what we have, and let's make the best
out of it. It's easier said, but a little bit harder doing it.
That's something that's noticeable now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillom, averaging 26 points, was in something close to shock
afterwards, speaking almost in a whisper to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm serious when I walked off the court, I wanted to hang my
head as low as I could even though people probably thought I had a
good performance,'' Gillom said. ``But it's embarrassing as a team
to let them see what kind of effort we put out there. You give me
100 percent effort, you can keep your head up high. But this is not
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play for 40 minutes every game. I'm going to say it
over and over. This league as tough as it is this year, we're going
to be in trouble if we keep this up.'' &QL; 
Note &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mercury starters Jennifer Gillom, Michele Timms, Edna Campbell
and Clarissa Davis-Wrightsil are among 27 Western Conference
choices on the WNBA All-Star ballot released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gillom, the 1998 WNBA most valuable player runner-up, is in
competition with Los Angeles' Lisa Leslie, the early league scoring
leader (24.5 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope everybody votes for me,'' said Gillom, who more
accurately should be listed at forward, her new starting position.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will select the starters in voting through June 30 with
head coaches Van Chancellor (Houston) and Linda Hill-MacDonald
(Cleveland) selecting the six reserves. The inaugural All-Star Game
will be July 14 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Voting can be done on line at WNBA.com, from June 20-30, at
Sears stores, and in the arena. &QL;

SICK JOHNSON LEAVES MARLINS FEELING QUEASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Marlin was being served at the press lounge and seared
at the plate Monday night at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson, pitching despite an upset stomach, had the
Florida Marlins looking ill and Tony Womack caught the
Diamondbacks' home run bug in a 2-0 victory before 37,144.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he took some pain medication for his back on an
empty stomach Sunday night and began to get flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   He was sick all day Monday, but it didn't keep him from taking
the mound. He gave up only two hits, struck out eight and retired
12 straight, before Manager Buck Showalter lifted him for a
pinch-hitter in the seventh inning after watching his left-hander
vomit in the dugout garbage can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to go out there in the eighth inning, but I threw
up in front of him,'' Johnson said. ``That changed his mind a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (9-2), in establishing a club record with five straight
victories, pushed the Diamondbacks (38-26) 12 games over .500 for
the first time. They gained a game on the San Francisco Giants in
the National League West. The Giants, three games behind Arizona,
lost to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Buck, if I'm going to pitch like this every time I've
got the flu, then come on flu,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson said he lacked energy, he didn't lack intensity
and found himself in a duel with 22-year-old right-hander Ryan
Dempster, who shut down the Diamondbacks' dangerous hitters in
order, before Johnson ripped a single up the middle in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had 98 home runs coming in, none by Womack, until the
sixth inning, when he made Dempster pay for his only mistake. After
fouling off three straight pitches, Womack lined a shot into the
right-field seats for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   How did it feel?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it's supposed to feel,'' he said ``I never
hit them. I leave that up to the big boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter left it up to the bullpen after Johnson's stomach
failed to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sunday's 13-inning, 3-1 victory in Anaheim, it came through
again.
</P>
<P>
   Byung-Hyun Kim, cleared of the bandage controversy by the
National League earlier in the day, struck out Kevin Orie and got
Danny Bautista to ground out to second. Newly acquired left-hander
Dan Plesac came in and got left-handed pinch-hitter Cliff Floyd to
fly out to left fielder Luis Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Plesac started the ninth and retired the first two batters _ on
a tapper back to him and strike out _ before Showalter brought in
Gregg Olson for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Plesac got a big out Sunday in his first game as a Diamondback.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a real shot in the arm for me,'' said Plesac,
who struggled with an ERA of 8.00 in Toronto. ``I mean I really
didn't have a very good beginning of the season. The first two
months were rough. I kept persevering and grinding. I knew I was a
better pitcher than what I've been, and I'm sure there were a lot
of people a little taken back by the trade if you look at the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know that I'm a hell of a lot better pitcher than what
I've shown the first seven to eight weeks of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter, who said he didn't want to ``overexpose'' Plesac,
gave the ball to Olson to pitch to Dave Berg. Olson, riding a
roller-coaster year, was greeted with boos.
</P>
<P>
   Olson gave up a single to Berg and to Bruce Aven, before getting
left-handed Tim Hyers to ground back to him for the final out. It
was Olson's 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks improved to 21-8 at home, best in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Sick or not, Johnson is settling in at BOB.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 93 pitches Johnson threw, 75 were strikes. Johnson didn't
walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's performance overshadowed that of Dempster, who started
the year in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster left in the seventh inning, after striking out catcher
Damian Miller, who, like Johnson, had the stomach flu but suffered
through an 0-for-3 night, all via the strikeout.

SMITH GOT HIS MAN, A PUPPET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Now that Bobby Smith has his perfect piece of clay,
what will become of Coyotes hockey?
</P>
<P>
   Is this the prelude to downsizing _ gutting a team into
quick-sale shape? Or a sign that the general manager will need an
extra hotel room this season? One for himself and one for his ego.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be downwind to know this one stinks. And if
you're wondering why Smith didn't officially anoint himself as the
next head coach of the Coyotes, well, that's easy. Coaches get
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Can we bring back Jim Schoenfeld, please?
</P>
<P>
   So the manual on ``How Not To Hire A Head Coach'' ends. And it
yields a strange new beginning, the Bobby Francis Era. And now that
you're done trembling with excitement, understand this great goose
chase has become a fiasco. You know it. The players know it. Even
an analyst on ``Hockey Night in'' ``Canada'' knows it. &QL; 
Surplus of drivers &QL; 
Two things have become clear during the past 12 months. Richard
Burke is a meddling owner, and Smith is a meddling general manager.
Burke should be hailed for his passion and Smith his eye for
talent, but there are too many back-seat drivers for one
organization, and word is beginning to spread that Phoenix is
becoming the dark hole of coaches.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a little dizzy here, so let's review: After the Coyotes win
a Game 4 in St. Louis, Burke goes out of his way to compliment
Schoenfeld's coaching ability. After losing Game 7, Smith insists
that Schoenfeld's job paranoia existed only in his mind. Why, to
the contrary, Schoenfeld was about to be reprieved until he talked
himself out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   Until he wouldn't yield power to Bobby Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld was known to bristle when Smith suddenly dropped a
player in the room, a la Brian Noonan. But he balked when Smith's
heavy touch became too much. Good for Schoenfeld. Everyone should
respect a man who so fiercely guards his integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Before you know it, an interview with John Tortorella goes
``extremely'' well. He suddenly emerges with glowing player
testimonials and an unquestioned reputation, a charismatic
straight-shooter unafraid to set the room straight.
</P>
<P>
   Tough to tell which hurt his chances more, the wave of good
publicity or Tortorella's insistence that he was nobody's cabin
boy. Whatever, he is gone, soon to be someone else's prize.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against Francis, who formerly coached minor league
hockey in Providence and drew rave reviews from youngsters he sent
to the parent club, the Boston Bruins. But he is walking into a
sticky situation and inheriting a dressing room stocked with strong
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   How long until they buy into Francis? How long before they
believe Smith isn't pulling his strings? &QL; 
Smooth transition nixed &QL; 
Tortorella was no Mike Keenan, but at least he offered intrigue. He
had a bit of momentum and the explicit trust of his players. The
transition would've been smooth, if not successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a notebook a mile long of things I wanted to do with
this team,'' Tortorella said. ``I felt my personality was a perfect
match for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't heard the latest, word is circulating that Smith
has already handpicked two assistants, Ryan Walter and Wayne
Fleming. If true, what kind of self-respecting coach walks into a
situation so short on control?
</P>
<P>
   So, not only must Francis justify a hire straight from left
field, he must first win over a dressing room full of suspicion:
That the new guy is one of them, that all secrets are safe, that
the new coach is not a mouthpiece to the front office.
</P>
<P>
   In this game, no one ever goes to war with a puppet.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Smith's brilliance in talent evaluation, he has
failed miserably as a purveyor of coaches, and maybe that's what
this is all about. Don Hay didn't work, and Schoenfeld wouldn't
conform. A general manager rarely gets three strikes, and this
time, who better to trust than yourself?
</P>
<P>
   So say hello to the next coach of the Coyotes: Bobby Francis
Smith. &QL;

COYOTES' SEARCH ENDS  
 BRUINS' ASSISTANT TO BE NAMED COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes will have a new head coach before they
head to the NHL Draft later this month in Boston. And they won't
have to fly him there to join them.
</P>
<P>
   That's because they have selected Boston Bruins assistant coach
Bobby Francis, who will be introduced on Wednesday as the Coyotes'
third head coach in four seasons, which ``The Arizona Republic''
first reported Monday on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement will be made at 1 p.m. at the Canadian Pacific
Scottsdale Princess resort.
</P>
<P>
   Francis' name hadn't been publicly linked to the job until
Monday morning, but he apparently has had several conversations
with General Manager Bobby Smith in the past few weeks and
impressed Smith so much that he offered him the job during the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Monday in San Diego, where he is vacationing with his
family, Smith would neither confirm nor deny the hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone this far,'' he said, ``let's just wait until
Wednesday when we have the announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis, 40, has spent the past two seasons as an assistant on
Bruins Coach Pat Burns' staff, along with fellow assistant Jacques
Laperriere, who spent 16 seasons as an assistant with the Montreal
Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   After notifying Coyotes assistant coach John Tortorella Monday
morning that he no longer is in the running to replace the recently
fired Jim Schoenfeld, Smith immediately finalized contract
negotiations with Francis regarding the length and salary of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed Francis will get a three-year deal worth at least
$350,000 a season. Schoenfeld, terminated after two seasons despite
a 74-66-24 record _ including a 90-point season this past year, the
team's second-best finish in its 20-year history _ had one year
remaining on a three-year deal worth $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Francis declined to be interviewed Monday. A Bruins'
spokesperson said Francis had no comment other than to say he has
spoken with Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Francis' two years with the Bruins are his only experience
behind an NHL bench. Before joining Boston, he spent two seasons as
the head coach of the club's top affiliate in the American Hockey
League, the Providence Bruins, where he compiled a 65-82-13 record.
</P>
<P>
   Providence won the AHL's Calder Cup championship Sunday night,
defeating Rochester in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about it,'' Coyotes center Jeremy
Roenick said Monday afternoon. ``You (media) guys know more than I
do, which is kind of sad . . . I don't really know who he is. I
talked to a couple of (Boston players) and they're saying good
things about him, but I can't make a comment about him because I
just don't know. That would be unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis' coaching career began with the Calgary Flames'
organization in 1986-87, first as a player/coach with the Salt Lake
City Golden Eagles of the International Hockey League. The team won
the Turner Cup that season as the IHL champion and successfully
defended its title the following year with Francis as a full-time
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988-89, he became the Golden Eagles head coach and held the
job for four seasons, which included a 50-win campaign in 1990-91.
When Calgary shifted its affiliation to Saint John in 1993-94,
Francis made the move as well and continued coaching the team until
joining Providence in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His father is Emile Francis, a former NHL goalie with the
Chicago Blackhawks and New York Rangers, who went on to become the
head coach and general manager of the Rangers from 1964-65 to
1974-75. He also coached the St. Louis Blues for parts of three
seasons and was the Blues' GM from 1976-77 to 1982-83. He served as
GM of the Hartford Whalers from 1983-84 to 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   Two possible assistant coaches who already have been confirmed
as viable candidates by Smith are New York Islanders assistant
Wayne Fleming, who has previous coaching experience with the
Canadian National team and in Europe, and former NHL player Ryan
Walter, who has spent the past five seasons as an NHL analyst in
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has said he will wait until he hires the head coach before
offering any jobs to assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Fleming and Islanders General Manager Mike
Milbury have not been successful. Walter, who spent 15 years in the
NHL with Washington, Montreal and Vancouver, said last week he
would be interested in a coaching opportunity in Phoenix. &QL;

TYSON FACES UNCERTAIN VALLEY FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Mike Tyson returned to the Valley Monday with a future
that includes a busy, disciplined schedule outside of the ring and
an uncertain one within it.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson met with the Maricopa County Probation Department,
according to public information and court liaison officer Gael
Parks, who said he would be subject to most of the same conditions
he had been under in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officer assigned to the case met with him,'' Parks said.
``We basically parroted what Maryland's terms are. Our requirements
really don't differ much.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a compact between the 50 states, Arizona will
assume Maryland's jurisdiction of Tyson, who was released from a
Montgomery County, Md., jail on May 26 after serving 3{ months of a
one-year sentence for a misdemeanor assault charge.
</P>
<P>
   His management has yet to announce an opponent or a date for his
next fight. Late August or September have been mentioned.
Speculated opponents include Axel Schulz of Germany and Brian
Nielsen of Denmark. He is still under contract for three fights at
Las Vegas MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just servicing their (Maryland) client,'' said Parks,
who also said Tyson will have to perform community service and
re-register as a sex offender, because of an earlier conviction for
sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson asked Maryland for permission to return to Arizona,
because it is expected he wants to resume training at the former
Madison Square Garden, a downtown Phoenix gym where he worked
before his victory on Jan. 16 over Francois Botha.
</P>
<P>
   He did not show up at the gym on Monday, but he is expected,
according to owner Ricky Ricardo. &QL;

TURF CHIEF HEADS FOR `MAJORS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Likening it to a promotion from minor league baseball to the New
York Yankees, Turf Paradise President Lonny Powell on Monday
accepted a position as president and chief executive officer of
renowned Santa Anita Park.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, 39, begins the new job next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance to move up from one of the greatest farm
clubs (Turf) in the country to the majors,'' Powell said. ``It's
awe-inspiring. Everybody knows about Santa Anita and what it means.
My father (a former jockey) rode there, and I used to go there as
kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dream come true, and it wasn't a dream, quite frankly,
that I thought of constantly. I feel very privileged this
opportunity came my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell also was named vice president of Ventures, a newly formed
subsidiary of Magna International Inc., which purchased Santa Anita
in December.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to racetracks, Ventures will be involved in leisure
real-estate development and the potential development of media,
sports and wagering activities in North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed Churchill Downs also was attempting to lure
Powell, who, despite increased gaming competition from nearby
casinos, helped Turf reach a record overall handle of nearly $263
million last season. When Powell first arrived, Turf's yearly
handle was about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill Downs owns Hollywood Park, but the contract doesn't
include Turf. Turf is owned by Hollywood Park Inc., a separate
entity from the Hollywood Park racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   A replacement for Powell at Turf is expected to be named by the
end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said he hadn't decided whether he would recruit any of
his current staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early,'' Powell said. ``I'm a fan of good people, and
there's a ton of them at Turf and at Santa Anita.''
</P>
<P>
   Purses during the recently concluded Turf meet averaged about
$70,000 a day. It was about $35,000 five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving at Turf, Powell previously held similar
positions at several racetracks owned by Hollywood Park. Powell is
a University of Arizona graduate and for four years was director of
the school's racetrack industry program.

<P>
   ``I think I'm leaving a place that's in considerably better
shape than it was when I arrived,'' Powell said. ``But I don't
think (Turf) is at the top of the roller coaster ready to slide
down. There's still significant potential, especially if Turf's
signal can get into California on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I really believe we've seen the worst of what the impact
will be from (casino gaming). I think Turf has proved it is a
survivor and can survive in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell will get a new challenge at Santa Anita, in Arcadia,
Calif. The racetrack is a regular stopover for the annual Breeders'
Cup, and its average daily purses approach $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Anita has the best horses and the best racing in the
country,'' Powell said. &QL;

BOSTON IS HEAL ING, BUT PLAYING IT SAFE

   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Cardinals rookie wide receiver &UR; David Boston won't
be diving over the middle to try to make any shoe-top catches this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The fractured bone in his left shoulder is healing nicely, but
the team isn't going to take any chances during the four days that
remain of rookie camp.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays on the injury on Monday were favorable, but he wasn't
cleared for full participation. Boston, the team's top draft pick,
will do only limited work this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My shoulder feels great, but they haven't released me to go
full speed,'' said Boston, who suffered the injury in last month's
minicamp. ``I'm right on schedule. (Training camp) is six weeks
from now. I'm going to be in good shape. But even now, I feel
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston felt good enough to run some pass patterns in Monday's
workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we want to get out of the next four days is the
mental part, getting our terminology refreshed in his mind,'' Coach
 &UR; Vince
 &UR; Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the first time Boston had been back at the Cardinals'
training facility since suffering the injury when he collided with
cornerback &UR; 
 &UR; Corey Chavous on the final day of minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the play was over, I hopped up (for the next play),'' he
said. ``But the second or third play later, I felt a twinge. I knew
something wasn't right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hold anything against Corey. We both were going full
speed. In those kind of drills, anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston, the Ohio State product picked eighth overall, said he
was in pain for the next couple of weeks. Once the pain subsided,
he started jogging.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, he has felt good enough to participate
in workouts in Boca Raton, Fla., with Minnesota Vikings wide
receivers  &UR; Cris
 &UR; Carter and  &UR; Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are showing me some of the little things they've
learned,'' Boston said.
</P>
<P>
   He learned Monday that his father,  &UR; Byron, will be part of the
NFL officiating crew for the Cardinals' preseason opener at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a wonderful deal, but I don't expect to get any breaks
from him,'' Boston said. ``He's a straight-up guy and honest
person. That's why he has been so successful as an official.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's dad, an NFL line judge, has done the past two NFC
championship games.
</P>
<P>
   Contract talks
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have heated up between the team and several of its
late draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   The agents for sixth-round picks  &UR; Melvin Bradley and &UR; Dennis
McKinley and seventh-rounder &UR; Chris Greisen said they have had
several discussions with Cardinals officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving positively forward,'' said agent  &UR; James
Divergilis, who represents McKinley, a fullback from Mississippi
State.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kyle Rote Jr., the agent for sixth-rounder &UR; Coby Rhinehart, was
unavailable for comment. But Rhinehart said Rote told him the two
sides had begun negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Each is expected to sign a three-year deal for annual salaries
of $175,000, $250,000 and $325,000. Most of the negotiating is on
the signing bonuses. &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   As expected, starting middle linebacker  &UR; Ronald McKinnon signed
his one-year tender offer of $937,000. The only remaining
restricted free agents are strong safety  &UR; Tommy Bennett and tight
end &UR; Johnny McWilliams, who could sign as early as today. Both have
been offered one-year deals worth $429,000.

BATES ALTERS CONTRACT TO HELP CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Running back Mario Bates has reworked his
contract to try to help the Cardinals solve their salary-cap
problems, team officials confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, who was scheduled to earn $1.2 million this season in the
second year of a two-year, $1.8 million deal, received a one-year
extension that reduced his salary-cap figure for 1999 by about
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   He will earn $725,000 this season _ a $150,000 bonus and a
salary of $575,000 _ and is scheduled to make $575,000 next year.
</P>
<P>
   On most NFL contracts, only the signing bonus is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, the Arizona State product who was a second-round draft
pick of the New Orleans Saints in 1994, rushed for six touchdowns
in the 1998 regular season and also had three scores in the NFC
second-round playoff game at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who were about $1.5 million under the $53.7
million salary cap before reworking Bates' deal, are trying to trim
at least $3 million off their payroll so they can sign their 11
draft choices. They have been given a rookie pool of $4.6 million
by the league.
</P>
<P>
   Bates and his agent, Jim Steiner of St. Louis, were unavailable
for comment. &QL;

TORTORELLA DIDN'T EXPECT TO GET JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When John Tortorella got the phone call he had been
waiting for Monday morning from Bobby Smith, the news, he said,
didn't take him by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of knew last week they were going to go in a different
direction,'' said Tortorella, an assistant coach with the Coyotes
the past two seasons. ``It's a pretty small league, and you hear
things. I got tidbits here and there and after a while, I felt
pretty strongly I would not be the new head coach here.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith made that official Monday, ruling out Tortorella from
consideration. The task of replacing Jim Schoenfeld behind the
Phoenix bench next season will belong to Bobby Francis, who has
spent the past two seasons as an assistant coach with the Boston
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Francis will be introduced Wednesday at a news conference set
for 1 p.m. at the Canadian Pacific Scottsdale Princess resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who's going to be coaching here,'' said
Tortorella, 41, ``just that Bobby (Smith) wants whoever it is to
play a more offensive and up-tempo style. That's fine. I'm just
going to miss the opportunity to coach those guys, because I was
really looking forward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the guys that count, the players. That's what a
coach hangs his hat on. You deal with those guys 24 hours a day for
eight months a year and you care about people. You want to see them
be successful both in life and in hockey. I care about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, if I'm coaching another team, we're going to come
in here and kick their (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   Smith would neither confirm nor deny that the job belongs to
Francis, but he said Monday the position came down to Tortorella
and one other finalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to a gut feeling,'' Smith said from San Diego,
where he was vacationing with his family. ``John would have made an
excellent coach for us. It was a difficult decision, but when I
weighed everything out, I concluded it was just a gut decision and
it was the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having said that, if I were to name John Tortorella as our new
head coach on Wednesday, I'd be thrilled with that. I've known John
for two years, and there's no reason why he wouldn't make a good
head coach here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tortorella said he would not consider remaining with the club as
an assistant. Instead, he plans to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Two likely possibilities are the New York Rangers and the Tampa
Bay Lightning. Tortorella is good friends with John Muckler, the
Rangers' head coach, and Rick Dudley, who was just hired to take
over the hockey operations of the Lightning. Many in the NHL are
expecting Dudley to make wholesale changes on the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was the right guy for this job, but in Bobby's
eyes, I'm not,'' said Tortorella, who spent six years as an
assistant with the Buffalo Sabres and two coaching Rochester, whom
he guided to the American Hockey League championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a whole list of changes I was prepared to make, right
from the conduct in the locker room to their actions on the ice.
It's not going to happen, but I had two great years here, this was
a great place to live, I enjoyed the community, and now it's time
to look elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Tortorella said he wasn't sure why Smith chose Francis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking the wrong guy,'' Tortorella said. ``That's
Bobby's call. I thought my two interviews went pretty well, but I
have strong convictions. I don't know any other way to answer
things than from my stomach. If it doesn't fit, it doesn't fit.
Obviously, it didn't with Bob.'' &QL;

A NDERSON SHOULD EXPLOIT GRACE PERIOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's not like tonight will make or break Brian
Anderson's career as a Diamondbacks starter.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, it would definitely behoove the likable
Anderson if he turned in a positive effort against the Florida
Marlins at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' brass is searching for something to make them
believe Anderson is capable of remaining in the rotation, where he
was placed last month to take the spot of injured pitcher Todd
Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's in does not mean Anderson will remain in the
rotation. The stakes this season have been raised to a far-higher
level than at any time in the franchise's short history. Leaving
someone in the rotation who is not shouldering his share of the
responsibility will not go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   One look at struggling Gregg Olson's banishment as the primary
closer (no matter that he has recorded the past two saves) is all
the evidence anyone needs to know this will not be an open tryout.
Especially not with a playoff spot hanging in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do what's best for the club,'' Manager Buck Showalter
said. ``Right now, we think Brian's that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The key point in that statement being, ``Right now.'' Showalter
is loyal to his players. Sometimes to a fault. But it's that fault
that makes most of those he comes in contact with want to return.
</P>
<P>
   But Showalter's first priority is to field a winner. It's also
his second and third priorities. With one-third of the season gone,
he has done a remarkable job and, it can be argued at this stage,
is probably the leading candidate for National League Manager of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   In order to keep his spot in the rotation, Anderson must reverse
what he's done in three of his four starts since returning from the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers so far have been ugly. Almost horrendous. His 9.58
ERA as a reliever before being inserted can be excused to a degree,
mostly because he's never spent any serious amount of time
relieving.
</P>
<P>
   But his 9.16 ERA as a starter is startling and probably won't be
tolerated for long. Nor should it. Anderson has failed to make it
through five innings in three of his four starts. With runners on
base, opponents are batting .426 against him.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed hitters, who have the percentages against a lefty,
are batting an unsightly .337 against Anderson. Lefties are hitting
a whopping .463. Overall, they're hitting .369 off Anderson, which,
if he had enough innings to qualify, would be the highest mark in
the league by 37 points.
</P>
<P>
   What may be the most disturbing statistic working against
Anderson is his home run-to-walk ratio of 8-5. It's revealing in
that it underscores how Anderson is dangerously close to the strike
zone too often.
</P>
<P>
   Walking a batter here or there is not necessarily the worst
thing a pitcher can do. Anderson must be able to be counted on and
that simply has not been the case so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to throw out everything he did for us last
year,'' Showalter said. ``Hopefully he'll get back into the swing
and pitch like he's capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if Anderson's downward spiral continues, you may ask.
What options do the Diamondbacks really have at this point? Well,
Nelson Figueroa's numbers at Triple-A Tucson (7-2, 4.00 ERA and 67
strikeouts in 74 innings) could very well merit a big-league shot.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa is currently on the disabled list because of a mild
case of tendinitis in his shoulder but it's nothing that seriously
concerns the club and he is expected to return to action within a
week.
</P>
<P>
   The other option, a more viable one the club is seriously
pondering, is to start Byung-Hyun Kim. Yes, it's true.
</P>
<P>
   Kim was very successful as a starter for the Triple-A
Sidewinders (going 2-0 with a 2.60 ERA in three starts). In
addition, he made his name as a starter in his native South Korea,
where it can be argued he was the more formidable starter on the
national team over a guy named Chan Ho Park.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Showalter has some options. As is always the case
with any player, it's now up to Anderson to keep his manager from
making a move. &QL;

NO SUSPENSION OR FINE FOR KIM OVER BAN DAGE INCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Diamondbacks were notified on Monday by the
National League that pitcher &UR; Byung-Hyun Kim will not be suspended
or fined over the heat-balm bandage that came out of his sleeve
during a pitch against the Chicago Cubs last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Manager &UR; Buck Showalter could crack a smile over the
incident that turned into bandage-gate since Kim's ejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's a little funnier,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Kim said he wore the bandage containing a heat
balm to loosen a tight shoulder and had forgotten he had it on
before entering the game in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   After Cubs first baseman  &UR; Mark Grace handed the bandage to the
umpire between innings and pointed out the balm, Kim was ejected
for having a foreign substance on his body.
</P>
<P>
   The bandage, videotape and umpires' report were sent to NL
President &UR; 
 &UR; Leonard Coleman's office for review.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he reviewed everything, he realized it was inadvertent
and there was no intent to gain an advantage,'' General Manager &UR; Joe
Garagiola Jr. said. &QL; 
Another honor &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another week, another Diamondback honored. It was third baseman
 &UR; Matt
 &UR; Williams' turn. Williams was named NL Player of the Week for the
second time this season, after collecting 24 total bases and 13
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher &UR; Randy Johnson and center fielder  &UR; Steve Finley garnered
the award the previous two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just everybody is playing good,'' Williams said. ``You
have somebody different (picking us up) every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams batted .481 (13 for 27) on the week with two homers,
six RBIs, eight runs, three doubles and a triple. Lost in the
offensive numbers, Showalter said, is Williams' play at third.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to make a play every game that a lot of third basemen
don't make,'' Showalter said. &QL;

 OLD COMPUTER + NEW BUSINESS TAX DEDUCTION  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Q: I recently created a sole proprietorship, in which I use a
computer that I purchased before the business existed. Can I claim
depreciation on this equipment when I file my taxes?
<P>
   A: Yes _ but you will have to do a little research first. You
must find out the market value of your computer as of the day you
started using it for business. Any computer dealer who buys and
sells used machines probably can help you.
</P>
<P>
   If the market value is less than you paid for the computer _
almost certainly the case _ then that becomes your cost basis in
determining how much you can depreciate. If by some strange chance
the market value is more than you paid _ for example, the computer
was autographed by Bill Clinton and Joe DiMaggio _ then the
original cost becomes your cost basis.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have figured your cost basis, you can depreciate that
amount over a five-year period. You will have to file Internal
Revenue Service Form 4562 with your tax return.
</P>
<P>
   Depreciation is a highly complicated subject. You need to find
out whether you qualify for straight or accelerated depreciation,
what adjustments to make if your computer stops working or you sell
it during the five-year period, and how to alter your cost basis if
you occasionally use the computer for personal use. That is more
than you asked and more than I have space for.
</P>
<P>
   For more details, get a copy of IRS Publication 946. You can
download it from the Internet at www.irs.gov, or order a copy by
telephone at (800) 829-3676.
</P>
<P>
   401(K) WITHDRAWALS
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently withdrew a large sum of money from my 401(k) plan
to make the down payment on a house. The plan trustees insisted on
withholding about 20 percent of the amount I withdrew to pay
federal and state income taxes. I am a first-time homebuyer, and I
thought that this entitled me to withdraw the money without paying
taxes. How do I get my money back?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid you have badly misinterpreted the law. Not only
must you pay regular income taxes on your withdrawal, but you also
must pay a 10 percent penalty tax if you are younger than 591/2
years old.
</P>
<P>
   If you had withdrawn the money from an Individual Retirement
Account to pay for a home, you would not be subject to the penalty
tax, although you still would have to pay regular taxes. Under the
law, 401(k) plans are treated less generously than IRAs in this
respect, unfair as that may seem.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers who were aware of the discrepancy used to get around
it by rolling over money from their 401(k) plans into IRAs, notes
IRS spokesman Jesse Weller. They would then withdraw money from the
IRA to make the down payment on a house, thus escaping the 10
percent penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, you can't do that anymore. Congress closed the loophole
effective with the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
   STOCK SPLIT PRICES
</P>
<P>
   Q: In press reports of stock splits, I have noticed the
expression ``based on today's price.'' What does any momentary
price have to do with a stock split? As I see it, the split will
affect the price, not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MONEYBAG (56543 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; A: Your question had me baffled until I used my computer to comb
through the 6,000 publications in the Dow Jones Interactive
database, looking for the phrase you mention. I found a few such
references.
</P>
<P>
   It usually goes something like this: ``Company XYZ plans a
2-for-1 stock split to take effect July 12. Based on today's
closing price of 112, the new shares would be worth $56 apiece.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing sinister here. The reporter is simply trying to
give you a rough idea of the price range for the post-split shares.
Not even the most naive reporter supposes that a future stock price
will necessarily be the same as today's price.

In a bid to avoid the Wild West atmosphere of most online

<P>
   Internet investment forums are fraught with misinformation,
disinformation and outright fraud perpetrated by people seeking to
manipulate stock prices, regulators have warned.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid those pitfalls, the nation's largest online broker
plans to take ``baby steps'' in building the investment discussion
sections on its Web site, said Alexandra Roddy, the Schwab vice
president supervising the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be piloting a very small number of message boards,''
Roddy said. The test program will start sometime between July and
September, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab is following in the footsteps of Palo Alto's E-Trade, the
No. 2 Internet broker, which has operated online discussion boards
for nine months. E-Trade now has hundreds of boards on general
investment themes and individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Although they acknowledge the risks, Schwab officials say
letting customers communicate with one another about investments is
a vital part of their strategy to build an online ``community.''
</P>
<P>
   Making customers feel they are part of a larger group is key to
cementing their loyalty to Schwab, which is in a cutthroat industry
in which the basic commodity _ the online stock trade _ can be
bought for as little as one-sixth of Schwab's standard $29.95
commission.
</P>
<P>
   One way to instill a sense of community is to offer online
investment discussion boards, such as those sponsored by Yahoo and
Motley Fool. Such boards, which allow Web surfers to post messages
about investment ideas or specific stocks, have become popular
tools for investors looking for ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But because participants can easily hide their identities,
message boards have become the vehicle of choice for spreading
false stories aimed at moving stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   In one notorious case in April, someone posted a phony news
report on sites operated by Lycos and Yahoo that telephone
equipment-maker PairGain Technologies was about to be acquired by
an Israeli company. PairGain shares rocketed up more than 30
percent before the hoax was exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission publicly
have sounded the alarm about the hazards of stock message boards
and have urged online brokerages to keep tight reins on such
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect the concerns of regulators,'' Roddy said. ``This is
pretty tricky turf.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, letting tipsters and rumor mongers onto message
boards would run counter to the trustworthy image Schwab seeks to
project, Roddy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very problematic things that have occurred on other boards
don't fit with who we are,'' Roddy said.
</P>
<P>
   The company still hasn't decided whether pilot message boards
will cover specific stocks in addition to general investment
issues, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Roddy said Schwab is working on a formula to preserve privacy
while not allowing participants to use their anonymity to
manipulate stocks, Roddy said. Schwab will police its message
boards heavily to remove manipulative, obscene and insulting
messages.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade uses an outside company to inspect its boards and take
off offensive or manipulative messages, said Jeff Tidwell, who
manages the firm's community-building programs.
</P>
<P>
   If Schwab's message board program is successful, the company
will add chat rooms in which customers can have real-time
discussions with each other, Roddy said.

 Heavy Toll on Calls From Prison
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c.1999, The San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jennine Grigsby was evicted from her Oakland apartment, her car
was repossessed and she was forced to move in with her mother after
she could no longer make her rent or car payments.
</P>
<P>
   Grigsby had not lost a job or fallen ill. Instead, the single
mother had amassed $400 monthly phone bills by accepting collect
calls from the father of her two children _ an inmate at San
Quentin State Prison.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people who have loved ones behind bars, Grigsby was
forced to pay just about the highest phone rates in the market.
</P>
<P>
   That is because prisoners can make collect calls only from pay
phones run by the company that has won the exclusive contract to
offer phone service at their prison. California, which awards the
contracts, collects a big commission _ as much as 44 cents per
dollar _ on prison pay-phone charges. Like many other states,
California picks the phone company that gives it the biggest
commission, not the lowest rates for prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Grigsby pays about $5 for a 15-minute collect call from San
Quentin to Oakland. The same call made from a pay phone right
outside the prison costs about $2.55.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer and prisoner advocates say this system gouges the
friends and families of prisoners. And they say the state
encourages price-gouging because it gets a share of the phone
companies' profits.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Utility Consumers Action Network, based in San Diego,
plans to file a complaint with state regulators alleging that MCI
WorldCom overcharges the families of prisoners and should be forced
to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the phone companies are taking advantage of a
vulnerable community,'' said UCAN's Charles Carbone. ``They're
saying it's OK to bilk families of prisoners and overcharge them
because they're a vulnerable community and they probably won't do
anything about it. That's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, Kentucky and Florida, relatives of prisoners or
government agencies have sued, investigated or fined companies for
alleged prison price-gouging.
</P>
<P>
   To pay off her debts, Grigsby has limited her calls from San
Quentin to once a week. Some families have had to cut off contact
with prisoners altogether _ something prisoner advocates warn will
harm society, because prisoners who lose contact with the outside
world are more likely to commit a crime when they get out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a 1998 report by the Florida House of Representatives
found that the 70 percent of prisoners who maintained contact with
a family member were less likely to get rearrested during their
first year out of prison. Those who had no contact were six times
more likely to return to prison in their first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most inmates come from disadvantaged backgrounds, so when the
companies charge these incredible rates, it puts a severe financial
strain on the families,'' said Kara Gotsch, with the American Civil
Liberties Union's national prison project. ``It's unfortunate that
correctional systems find it necessary to allow this burden to
continue on families so they can make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   In California state prisons, inmates can make collect calls
using only MCI or GTE _ whichever has the exclusive contract in
their prison.
</P>
<P>
   MCI provides long-distance service at 33 California state
prisons, and GTE provides pay-phone service at four.
</P>
<P>
   The phone companies say some of the money they collect from
prison calls pays for mandatory operator assistance, added security
features and commissions to the state.
</P>
<P>
   For each dollar it collects on prison calls, MCI pays the state
44 cents. GTE pays 33 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, those commissions amounted to about $16 million. This
year, that figure is expected to exceed $20 million because of rate
increases and a growing prison population, according to state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Corrections would not comment on the prison
pay-phone contract, referring questions to the Department of
General Services, which bids all contracts for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Case, manager of the state Department of General Services'
pay-phone division, said ``The state tries to get the best
commission it can from a vendor, whether it's Burger King going on
a University of California campus'' or MCI offering phone service
in state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, long-distance collect calls from pay phones in
state-run prisons cost about 50 cents per minute, on top of an
automatic $3 surcharge for each call.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, people outside prisons typically pay 8 to 55
cents per minute for a long-distance collect call, plus a $2.25 to
$3.25 surcharge for operator assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The high end of that range represents collect, operator-assisted
peak-hour calls from places like airports and hotel rooms. Most
people can avoid those extremes by being careful about how they
place their calls. Prisoners do not have that option.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a truly captive customer base,'' said Carbone.
</P>
<P>
   Rates probably will go even higher.
</P>
<P>
   MCI recently filed an application with the state Public
Utilities Commission to raise rates on local toll calls from
California state prisons to a flat rate of 30 cents per minute.
Right now, those calls cost from 6 to 20 cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, California plans to rebid its pay-phone contract
in August. Sources said the state probably will seek larger
commissions, which could lead to even higher rates for prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The phone companies will not disclose how much they earn from
prison revenue. But consumer watchdogs say the phone companies bid
high for these contracts because they are so lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has gone into the phone business and is sharing the
profits with these providers,'' said Gerald Norlander, deputy
director of the Public Utility Project in Albany, N.Y. ``The
companies are definitely making a profit off this. The cost for the
hardware they need to install has been tumbling, and the actual
cost of providing the call is very cheap. It can be very lucrative
for these companies; that's why they are willing to give these
states $20 million.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Ian Hicks, an executive manager with MCI, said these
contracts are profitable but also require a big investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have extensive call security technology in place in
addition to an advanced network,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many states award their prison-phone contracts to the highest
bidder, but use most of their commissions to benefit inmates. New
York, Florida and Ohio collected a total of $48 million last year,
but sent that money to inmate welfare funds to pay for books,
prison education programs and other inmate-related expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In California, prison pay-phone revenues go into the state's
general fund. Only a handful of other states _ including Hawaii,
Delaware and Virginia _ send prison-phone rebates to their general
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The state gets a commission from pay phones that MCI and GTE
operate in all state-owned facilities _ not just prisons but also
state office buildings, state-run hospitals and state colleges.
</P>
<P>
   California gets the same commission percentage from all phones
on state property. But the per-minute rates and surcharges are much
higher in prisons.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the state gets about 75 percent of its pay-phone
revenues from prisons, even though they represent only 25 percent
of the total phones on state property.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the state's commissions on the 7,500 phones on state
property are mainly profit, since it does not pay to install,
maintain or operate the phones. Instead, those costs are paid by
MCI and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials say part of the commission pays for staff to
escort inmates to phones and monitor their calls to make sure they
are not planning a crime.
</P>
<P>
   State officials would not say how much they spend on those
activities, but a report prepared by the Department of Corrections
staff last year pointed out that prisons do not monitor all inmate
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, the actual monitoring and investigation of inmate
calls is limited,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the prison industry say California's costs
do not come close to what the state collects in commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving (prisoners) from one cell to another place may take
resources too, but I think they've been working that out for 100
years or more,'' Norlander said. ``When a guy has to go to the
chaplain or to recreational yard or to see a lawyer, they have to
figure out how to keep track of them in transit. They don't need
$20 million to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Prisoner advocates say it is crucial for prisoners to stay in
contact with the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a support system,'' said Gotsch of the ACLU. ``The
way to continue a family bond is through phone contact because many
times it's very difficult and expensive for the family to come and
visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Nolan, the former California legislator who served time in a
federal prison in Dublin, said the high prison phone rates ``put a
barrier to keeping in touch that is just unconscionable. The prison
system should be doing all it can to encourage contact with
prisoners' families.'' Nolan is now president of The Justice
Fellowship, a prisoner advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners' families say that besides high rates and surcharges,
they are hit with other unfair fees. Among their complaints:
</P>
<P>
   _Calls often are disconnected after a minute or two, forcing the
inmate to redial and pay an additional $3 surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   A bill from one inmate's wife who lives in Gardena but did not
want to be identified shows two dropped calls in one weekend. By
the time the couple finally completed their 15-minute call, the
cost was more than $16.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said MCI has heard similar complaints and said it may be
caused by technical glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go out to the prisons and do hear that complaint every now
and then,'' Hicks said. ``We try to isolate where that problem is
coming from.'' He also said some calls may be cut off by prison
personnel, who are allowed to monitor calls and end them if the
conversation broaches a topic deemed illegal.
</P>
<P>
   _Some are charged for calls that last longer than the 15-minute
time limit imposed by the Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Lara Johnson, whose husband is incarcerated at Sacramento state
prison, was billed last year by MCI for a 113-minute call she says
she never received. She was eventually given a $12 refund for the
call.
</P>
<P>
   _Charges for calls from prison sometimes exceed the published
rates.
</P>
<P>
   James Nunn, whose son is in Calipatria State Prison in Southern
California, was billed $7.42 by MCI for a seven-minute call to his
home in Tucson, Ariz. Minus the $3 surcharge, that comes out to 63
cents per minute _ 13 cents more per minute than what MCI says it
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Jackson lives in Reno, and his wife is in Chowchilla State
Prison. His MCI bill shows a 15-minute call that cost $11.10.
Without the $3 surcharge, that breaks down to 54 cents per minute,
4 cents over MCI's published rate.
</P>
<P>
   MCI and GTE say they do not charge more than their stated rates.
``There's a capped rate to make sure no one goes off the chart, and
we follow that,'' said Hicks of MCI.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the company could charge as much as 55 cents a
minute, but stays below that.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Walters, whose husband was in Calipatria State Prison,
has bills that show the huge difference between a collect call from
prison versus a calling-card call.
</P>
<P>
   A six-minute calling-card call placed from a pay phone outside
Calipatria prison to Walters' home in Hemet cost $1.08. A
six-minute collect call made from her husband to the same number
cost $3.92.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband was transferred to Folsom State Prison, Walters
packed up her things and moved 472 miles from Hemet to Sacramento
so she could be close enough to talk to him in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has caused so much hardship for me and my husband,'' said
Walters. He's the one who's in prison, but I'm the one being
punished by having to pay these bills and then move myself up here.
That shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   In other states, prisoner families and government agencies have
taken action against high prison phone rates.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the families of Illinois prison inmates sued MCI, AT&AMP;T
and Ameritech, contending that the phone companies unfairly charge
higher rates for collect calls from jails.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Public Service Commission is investigating
complaints that MCI overcharged customers for calls made from jail
and prison pay phones.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Florida Public Service Commission ordered MCI to
refund customers for overcharging them by $2 per call for collect
calls made from Florida correctional facilities from February to
July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the claims, MCI paid a $10,000 fine and put
$189,482.49 into a prisoners fund.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, an outcry from prisoners and their families in
Virginia prompted the state to negotiate a new contract with MCI.
Its surcharges dropped from $3 to $2.25.
</P>
<P>
   UCAN's Carbone said California should follow Virginia's lead and
consider lowering the surcharges and getting rid of the bidding
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The families of prisoners shouldn't be going broke just trying
to stay in contact,'' Carbone said. ``If nothing else, the cost of
the calls should be tied to the cost of providing the service.''

system should be doing all it can to encourage contact with
prisoners' families.'' Nolan is now president of The Justice
Fellowship, a prisoner advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners' families say that besides high rates and surcharges,
they are hit with other unfair fees. Among their complaints:
</P>
<P>
   _Calls often are disconnected after a minute or two, forcing the
inmate to redial and pay an additional $3 surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   A bill from one inmate's wife who lives in Gardena but did not
want to be identified shows two dropped calls in one weekend. By
the time the couple finally completed their 15-minute call, the
cost was more than $16.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said MCI has heard similar complaints and said it may be
caused by technical glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go out to the prisons and do hear that complaint every now
and then,'' Hicks said. ``We try to isolate where that problem is
coming from.'' He also said some calls may be cut off by prison
personnel, who are allowed to monitor calls and end them if the
conversation broaches a topic deemed illegal.
</P>
<P>
   _Some are charged for calls that last longer than the 15-minute
time limit imposed by the Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Lara Johnson, whose husband is incarcerated at Sacramento state
prison, was billed last year by MCI for a 113-minute call she says
she never received. She was eventually given a $12 refund for the
call.
</P>
<P>
   _Charges for calls from prison sometimes exceed the published
rates.
</P>
<P>
   James Nunn, whose son is in Calipatria State Prison in Southern
California, was billed $7.42 by MCI for a seven-minute call to his
home in Tucson, Ariz. Minus the $3 surcharge, that comes out to 63
cents per minute _ 13 cents more per minute than what MCI says it
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Jackson lives in Reno, and his wife is in Chowchilla State
Prison. His MCI bill shows a 15-minute call that cost $11.10.
Without the $3 surcharge, that breaks down to 54 cents per minute,
4 cents over MCI's published rate.
</P>
<P>
   MCI and GTE say they do not charge more than their stated rates.
``There's a capped rate to make sure no one goes off the chart, and
we follow that,'' said Hicks of MCI.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the company could charge as much as 55 cents a
minute, but stays below that.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Walters, whose husband was in Calipatria State Prison,
has bills that show the huge difference between a collect call from
prison versus a calling-card call.
</P>
<P>
   A six-minute calling-card call placed from a pay phone outside
Calipatria prison to Walters' home in Hemet cost $1.08. A
six-minute collect call made from her husband to the same number
cost $3.92.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband was transferred to Folsom State Prison, Walters
packed up her things and moved 472 miles from Hemet to Sacramento
so she could be close enough to talk to him in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has caused so much hardship for me and my husband,'' said
Walters. He's the one who's in prison, but I'm the one being
punished by having to pay these bills and then move myself up here.
That shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   In other states, prisoner families and government agencies have
taken action against high prison phone rates.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the families of Illinois prison inmates sued MCI, AT&AMP;T
and Ameritech, contending that the phone companies unfairly charge
higher rates for collect calls from jails.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Public Service Commission is investigating
complaints that MCI overcharged customers for calls made from jail
and prison pay phones.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Florida Public Service Commission ordered MCI to
refund customers for overcharging them by $2 per call for collect
calls made from Florida correctional facilities from February to
July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the claims, MCI paid a $10,000 fine and put
$189,482.49 into a prisoners fund.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, an outcry from prisoners and their families in
Virginia prompted the state to negotiate a new contract with MCI.
Its surcharges dropped from $3 to $2.25.
</P>
<P>
   UCAN's Carbone said California should follow Virginia's lead and
consider lowering the surcharges and getting rid of the bidding
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The families of prisoners shouldn't be going broke just trying
to stay in contact,'' Carbone said. ``If nothing else, the cost of
the calls should be tied to the cost of providing the service.''

PUC MAY DERAIL LOS ANGELES AREA CODE OVERLAY  &HT;     BY DEBORAH SOLOMON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
State regulators may consider halting California's first area code
overlay, which took effect just two months ago in West Los Angeles.
<P>
   Faced with mounting complaints from customers, pressure from
legislators and technical glitches, the state Public Utilities
Commission plans to vote on July 8 whether to temporarily suspend
the area code overlay so that it can debate the merits of 11-digit
dialing.
</P>
<P>
   The overlay _ designed to address a shortage of phone numbers in
the region _ went into effect in the 310 region on April 17,
forcing all residents in that area to dial 1 plus the area code and
phone number for every call. After July 17, new phone customers in
the 310 region will get 424 as their area code.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the PUC temporarily suspends implementation, phone
companies could not give out any numbers with a 424 area code.
Instead, new phone customers would be assigned 310 numbers. State
regulators would use the suspension time to decide whether to ditch
or keep the overlay. Eleven-digit dialing would not be affected
while the PUC considers its options. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The decision is important to the Bay Area, which is slated to
get get overlays in the 408, 415, 510 and 650 regions during the
next two years. If the 310 overlay is scrapped, it could lead to a
reversal of some Bay Area overlays because more people here came to
public meetings to object to an overlay than in the 310 region,
industry watchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Residents of 310) came closer to favoring (an overlay) than
any other population in the state,'' said Natalie Billingsley, a
telecommunications expert with the PUC. But when the overlay went
into effect, ``the people in 310 hit the roof. ... I can't imagine
408 will be any calmer.'' Residents in 408 will be the first in the
Bay Area to get an overlay, starting in October.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the PUC decides temporarily to suspend implementation of
the 424 area code, that does not mean the West Los Angeles overlay
will be scrapped. The suspension merely would give state regulators
time to consider whether the overlay was the right policy for 310.
</P>
<P>
   The 310 overlay has not gone smoothly. Customers had trouble
getting through to some numbers with 11-digit dialing, some alarm
systems don't work with the overlay, and people have been confused
by the change.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, state Assemblyman Wally Knox, D-Los Angeles, and
U.S. Representative Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, filed a petition
asking California regulators to halt the overlay in 310, saying
that it was hurting consumers and that phone companies had not
shown it was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of AREACODE () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Although the PUC took public comment into consideration before
voting for the overlay, Knox argues that not enough people gave
their opinions at the public hearings held before state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   He and Waxman want the overlay halted indefinitely until phone
companies prove they actually need area code relief.
</P>
<P>
   Knox contends that there is no area code crunch and that there
are more than 145 million telephone numbers in the state that have
been assigned to phone companies but are not being used.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know now that there's no need to impose additional area
codes on California,'' Knox said. ``The big lie was always that the
consumers were at fault because they carried cell phones and
pagers, which created a demand for new numbers that could only be
sated by the creation of new area codes. That's not the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Knox said, phone companies have been hoarding phone
numbers, artificially draining the supply of available digits.
</P>
<P>
   Knox has a bill pending in the Assembly that would force phone
companies to disclose how many phone numbers they have and how many
are in use before consumers are inconvenienced with an overlay. His
bill is scheduled to be heard by the Senate Energy, Utilities and
Communications Committee on June 22.
</P>
<P>
   Once the state knows how many phone numbers actually are in use,
the PUC could force phone companies to return any unused numbers so
they could be given to other phone companies. Until phone companies
supply that data, Knox said, the state should refuse to allow an
overlay.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, phone numbers are assigned in blocks of 10,000,
regardless of how many customers a company has. So even if a phone
company only has 300 customers, it still must request 10,000
numbers. With more than 150 phone companies operating in California
and requesting new phone numbers, the supply of available numbers
in each area code has quickly dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   Knox's bill would require that numbers be assigned in blocks of
1,000 instead of 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission recently opened a
proceeding to look into how numbers are assigned and could issue
new rules within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   John Britton, a spokesman for Pacific Bell, said that though
people might not like overlays, West Los Angeles is in need of area
code relief.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said Pac Bell, which supported the overlay along with
other phone companies, is using about 86 percent of the numbers
it's assigned in the state.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of AREACODE () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Just under 32 million numbers are assigned to Pac Bell, and
just over 27 million are in use,'' Britton said. ``What Pac Bell
supports and what's going to ultimately benefit customers most is a
system where all competitors can get phone numbers to compete
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   If the overlay is overturned, it would be only the second time
11-digit dialing has been halted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Texas regulators stopped an overlay in Houston several
months after it began because they felt it was too disruptive. The
state then implemented a geographic area code split, but six months
later, it reimplemented the overlay.

   PRISONPHONES _ Jennine Grigsby was evicted from her Oakland
apartment, her car was repossessed and she was forced to move in
with her mother after she could no longer make her rent or car
payments. Grigsby had not lost a job or fallen ill. Instead, the
single mother had amassed $400 monthly phone bills by accepting
collect calls from the father of her two children _ an inmate at
San Quentin State Prison. Like many people who have loved ones
behind bars, Grigsby was forced to pay just about the highest phone
rates in the market. That is because prisoners can make collect
calls only from pay phones run by the company that has won the
exclusive contract to offer phone service at their prison.

 GREENSPAN SINGS HIGH-TECH'S PRAISES
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C.1999 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE &QC;  &LR; 
WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans kicked off a three-day paean
to Silicon Valley on Monday with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan testifying that ``something special has happened to the
U.S. economy'' _ a high-tech revolution that has fueled an
unprecedented economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has vastly improved the economy's efficiency,
Greenspan said, lifting productivity and living standards while
keeping inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan sounded a characteristically cautious note in
warning that, while the productivity will continue to increase,
some sort of slowdown is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of growth of productivity cannot increase
indefinitely,'' Greenspan told Congress' Joint Economic Committee.
``While there appears to be considerable expectation in the
business community, and possibly Wall Street, that the productivity
acceleration has not yet peaked, experience advises caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was the lead speaker in a star-studded ``National
Summit on High Technology,'' the three-day parade of some two dozen
high-tech chief executives sponsored by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee offered a raft of statistics to demonstrate
technology's increasingly prominent role in the economy, including
the fact that San Francisco is the ``most-wired U.S. city,'' with
72 percent of adults now online, followed by Miami, Houston,
Seattle/Tacoma and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Chief Executive Officer Craig Barrett, appearing by remote
video, predicted that within six years, the Internet will boast 1
billion connected computers. Barrett said Intel took its first
order over the Internet last July and now does half its business,
about $15 billion this year, over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the economy's nearly two-decade run is rooted in
better and faster information flows to businesses and consumers
alike.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from supermarket bar codes to computer-aided design
to online stock trading has eliminated layers of costly
intermediaries and inventoris, Greenspan noted.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the economy becomes even more efficient as
technology improves. That means the same number of workers using
the same value of equipment can produce more and higher quality
goods at lower cost, allowing living standards to rise
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity has increased at an annual rate of 2 percent for
the past three years, a period that dovetails with the emergence of
the Internet as an economic force, double the rate of the 1970s and
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did not have the dramatic changes in productivity that
we have seen, it is extremely doubtful that the economy would be
behaving anywhere near as well as it has in recent years,''
Greenspan said. Rising productivity, he said, has been as ``a
crucial factor in the remarkable economic performance of this
business expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM chief executive Louis Gerstner testified as well, in person,
and compared the information technology revolution to the invention
of the printing press in the Middle Ages or the automobile at the
turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnessing nothing less than the rise of the digital
economy and a new global medium that will be the single most
important driver of business, economic and social change in the
coming century,'' Gerstner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet will even challenge the very idea of the
nation-state, he predicted. ``A world connected by global networks
has more fluid borders,'' he said. ``It will put pressure on basic
organizing mechanisms like the nation state, where borders were
determined by rivers or mountain ranges or languages or where the
last war was fought. The Internet is borderless.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerstner warned that government regulations that applied to old
technologies like telephones are ill-suited to the Internet. ``It's
a grave error to think the Internet and e-business will develop
under the kind of regulation we could apply, say, to the phone
system back in the dates when coal and steel were determinants of a
nations' greatness,'' Gerstner said.
</P>
<P>
   The executives urged Congress to aid their industry by doing
such things as funding basic scientific research and easing export
controls on computers and encryption technology. They also urged
making the research and development tax credit permanent as part of
their push for a light regulatory hand.

 PROGRAMMERS GATHER TO TALK OVER JAVA  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The largest-ever assembly of software developers begins  &LR; Tuesday
 &LR; in San Francisco as more than 20,000 users of Sun Microsystems'
Java programming language gather at the Moscone Convention Center.
<P>
   They are coming for the annual JavaOne conference, which runs
through Thursday. The programmers will hear Sun announce new
initiatives to bring Java to handheld computers and to expand the
language's growing role on corporate networks and Web servers.
</P>
<P>
   Java is designed to create software that can run on many types
of computing hardware. Sun will bolster that claim Tuesday by
announcing a new version of the technology that is small enough to
run on miniature devices such as handheld organizers and ``smart''
cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies endorsing Sun's streamlined ``Java 2 Micro
Edition'' will be 3Com, which will integrate it into the Palm
series of pocket organizers. 3Com will offer the Java software free
for Palm developers beginning Tuesday. It eventually will become a
standard part of all future Palm devices.
</P>
<P>
   That move will allow developers to use Java to create programs
for the popular Palm line, which dominates the market for handheld
computing devices. To encourage developers to seize the
opportunity, Sun and 3Com plan to sell up to 10,000 PalmV
organizers to JavaOne attendees at less than half price.
</P>
<P>
   The deal could mean a wider selection of commercial and
shareware software for the more than 3 million users of the Palm
devices. Sun officials said, however, that they have tested the
Java software only on the Palm III and later models, not on the
original Palm Pilot products.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola also will announce plans to roll the new version of
Java into its two-way pagers, and NTT Dokomo, Japan's largest
provider of cell-phone service, will add support for it in cell
phones. Eventually, Sun said, the Java Micro Edition will also go
into new ``information appliances'' such as set-top boxes and
Web-enabled telephones, as well as into automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Micro Edition can run on as little as 100 kilobytes of
memory, far less than previous versions required, Sun said. It does
not support all Java features, just a subset required when users
are ``untethered'' from the Internet or a corporate network. When
they connect to a network _ via modem, wireless link or local-area
network _ new companion software Sun will supply for its network
server computers will give the handheld device additional
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the portion of the Micro Edition loaded on handheld
devices does not include Java's ``byte-code verifier,'' software
that scans Java program code to make sure it is not about to do
something malicious to the user's system.
</P>
<P>
   That feature could be left out because it is of no use as long
as the device is untethered, according to Alan Baratz, president of
Sun's Software Products and Platforms division. Once the user
reconnects to the network and therefore is again at risk from rogue
software, the verifier would be run from the server computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sun will announce another new Java package, called the
Enterprise Edition, designed for developers writing programs to run
on corporate networks. By next year, according to Forrester
Research data cited by Sun, 72 percent of Fortune 1000 companies
are expected to have Java programs running on their servers.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise Edition will be supported by a ``who's-who in
server software,'' including Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Oracle,
according to Jon Kannegaard, vice president and general manager of
Sun's Java Platform group. In addition, Sun will announce that it
has licensed Java technology to the Apache Group, the developer
cooperative responsible for Apache, a free software product that
runs more than 50 percent of all Web servers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Java has not lived up to some of its early hype, it
is increasingly popular among software developers, especially those
writing programs for big corporations.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million programmers have now signed up with Sun's
Developer Connection program, the company said. Java has enjoyed
strong support in most of the software industry, but Microsoft, the
industry powerhouse, has offered only lukewarm support. Microsoft
licensed Java from Sun, but the two companies are locked in a legal
battle over Sun's charges that Microsoft violated the terms of its
license by adding Windows-specific features to its version of the
language.

 COMPUTER WORM TAKES A MORE DEADLY TURN  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
A virulent computer program that wiped out files on tens of
thousands of computers worldwide since last week is more dangerous
than first thought, security experts warned Monday.
<P>
   The malicious software _ the third such plague to strike
Internet users in the past four months _ can continually spread
itself within a company's computer network, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The software deletes information in computer documents created
with Microsoft applications, such as Word, Excel and Power Point.
When discovered last week, experts thought it was spread only
through an attachment sent by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   However, researchers at the Carnegie Mellon Computer Emergency
Response Team this weekend found that once activated, the software
can spread itself to other Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98 and
Windows NT documents that are shared on a network.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  For example, if a company is using the Windows ``share''
function to allow an Excel spreadsheet to be used by various
employees, the software _ called Worm.Explore.Zip _ can copy itself
to that document and then spread itself to other desktops on the
same network.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the software more insidious and harder to stamp out
because one unchecked machine could spread it even if desktops in
the rest of the network were inoculated by antivirus software.
</P>
<P>
   The software also can copy itself when a user logs onto another
machine, said Shawn Hernan, a CERT team leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``An infected machine will continue to attempt to reinfect other
machines on the network,'' Hernan said. ``Attempts to clean up
machines one at a time may be futile because other machines may be
reinfected.''
</P>
<P>
   The worm doesn't delete files, but tells the computer system
that the files have no data, said Dan Schrader, a vice president
for antivirus software-maker Trend Micro Inc. in Cupertino.
</P>
<P>
   Antivirus software firms said their help lines had a steady
stream of calls Monday from people whose computers were infected.
</P>
<P>
   The exact number of computers hit was unclear, but the program
reportedly has struck tens of thousands of computers in more than a
dozen countries.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Wasson, director of security products for Network Associates
Inc., said the Santa Clara antivirus-maker saw a slight decrease in
calls from corporate customers seeking help Monday though the
volume of calls still was twice what it was on a normal Monday. And
Network Associates tracked about 10 million downloads of its
software on Friday and Saturday alone.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of VIRUS15 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  New reports of infections were coming from Eastern European
countries, such as Romania and the Czech Republic, Wasson said.
</P>
<P>
   Worm.Explore.Zip first was detected in Israel and spread quickly
on Thursday and Friday, striking at major U.S. corporations such as
AT&AMP;T, Boeing, General Electric and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The program is attached to an e-mail that looks like a reply to
a previous message. The e-mail invites the recipient to ``look at
the attached zipped docs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the third serious malady to hit the computer world in four
months. The Melissa virus in March was the most widespread but
caused little damage other than clogging corporate e-mail servers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``CIH'' or Chernobyl virus in April was more contained but
still disabled hundreds of thousands of computers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader said viruses and other types of malicious software are
becoming more sophisticated, moving so fast that even
antivirus-makers are having trouble keeping up.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in the near future, the virus protection
``battlefield'' is going to have to shift past the individual
desktops to the Internet as a whole. He called on major Internet
service providers to start screening e-mails sent and received by
their users for viruses _ just as the airline industry screens
baggage for bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hoffman, director of the Internet Mail Consortium, a trade
association representing 30 service providers like America Online
and the Microsoft Network, agreed that Internet virus screening
would be good.
</P>
<P>
   However, he noted that antivirus software-makers have not come
up with a product that is cost-effective and doesn't slow down an
Internet provider handling millions of pieces of e-mail a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unreasonable for anyone to say you should do this unless
it is clear that it is viable,'' said Hoffman, whose own computer
was infected by Worm.Explore.Zip even though he checked it with two
different antivirus programs.

 OUTAGE HAS EBAY STOCK IN THE DARK  &HT;     By JON SWARTZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Shares of eBay short-circuited Monday after the online auction site
continued to malfunction over the weekend, following a nearly
22-hour outage on Friday.
<P>
   The San Jose company's stock plunged $29.88, or 18 percent, to
$136.74. The holdings of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, the company's
largest shareholder, plummeted $1 billion, to $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   EBay's technical travails and nosedive on Wall Street prompted
financial analysts to ponder whether many of eBay's 3.8 million
customers will become fed up with the frequent disruptions and bolt
to competing auction services from Amazon.com and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question people will leave, and there is a
longer-term risk that eBay will be considered an unreliable
service,'' said analyst Derek Brown, of Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co.
LLC in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Users of eBay encountered sluggish service and an inoperable
search engine on Saturday and Sunday _ after the service was
offline most of Friday. Customers also complained of missing
auction results and fewer listings throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We limited functions while bringing the system back up,'' eBay
spokesman Kevin Pursglove said, noting that 1.8 million items were
listed the past few days versus 2.2 million last week. He expects
eBay to reach 2.3 million items in seven to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   A team of 55 engineers worked all weekend trying to avoid a
repeat of the embarrassing technical glitch that plunged eBay into
darkness from 7:50 p.m. Thursday until 5:30 p.m. on Friday. EBay
lost an estimated $3 million to $5 million because of the outage.
</P>
<P>
   EBay blamed the daylong blackout on a corrupted database caused
by faulty software from Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Sun officials agreed _ to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software is a complex environment where products from several
vendors have to interact,'' said Alan Baratz, president of Sun's
software products and platforms division. ``We're doing a
postmortem to determine exactly what happened, why it happened and
to make sure it never happens again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know that our hardware and software are products that
thousands of customers depend on,'' Baratz said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of EBAY15 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  EBay's network problems could extend beyond balky Sun software,
industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were just one piece of software, then other companies
would be reporting similar problems,'' said Frode Odegard, chief
executive of Odegard Labs Inc., a software research firm in San
Diego. ``A large number of Internet service providers, e-commerce
sites and online trading companies use Sun hardware and software
without reports of failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The frequent breakdowns _ eBay has suffered at least five since
early May _ are likely to tax the patience of millions of consumers
who routinely buy and sell everything from sports memorabilia to
``Star Wars'' action figures. With 80 percent of the market, eBay
is the world's biggest digital auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   EBay officials moved quickly to remain in its customers' good
graces. In a conciliatory online message, Omidyar and eBay chief
executive Meg Whitman vowed to refund all fees for auctions held
Thursday and Friday, as well as any future outage longer than two
hours; extend by 48 hours the bidding on items affected by the
blackout; and offer free auction listings next month to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay has done a good job of acting quickly to appease the
public,'' Brown said. ``Their immediate actions strongly suggest
they apologize and accept the blame.''

 INDEXED TREASURY BONDS A HAVEN FROM INFLATION  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Now that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is warning about a
possible surge in inflation, cautious investors might want to
consider a largely neglected financial vehicle _ inflation-indexed
U.S. Treasury bonds.
<P>
   These bonds were first issued in January 1997, but they haven't
been nearly as popular as standard Treasuries. They look less
attractive on the surface, because they offer a relatively low
interest payment _ currently about 3.9 percent per year for 10-year
bonds, compared with about 6 percent for standard Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   However, inflation-indexed bonds will produce more lucrative
returns than other Treasuries if inflation stays significantly
above 2 percent for a prolonged period.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the redemption value of the indexed bonds _ the
amount you receive from the U.S. Treasury when the bonds mature _
is adjusted upward semiannually at the rate of inflation, as
measured by the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   _ If you buy an indexed bond with a $10,000 redemption value,
and six months later the CPI has increased by, say, 1.5 percent,
the redemption value of the bond automatically rises to $10,150.
The inflation adjustments are compounded semiannually each year
until the bond matures.
</P>
<P>
   _ The size of the interest payment also rises with inflation. If
the initial interest rate on a $10,000 bond is 3.9 percent
annually, you would start out with interest payments totaling $195
semiannually. So your total income from the bond after six months
would be $345 (interest plus inflation adjustment).
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the redemption value of the bond adjusted to $10,150,
your semiannual interest payment would rise to $197.92.
</P>
<P>
   _ You get downside protection if the economy goes into a
deflationary spiral. In that case, the redemption value of the bond
will never fall below $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   With standard Treasuries, by contrast, the redemption value
isn't adjusted for inflation and the interest rate doesn't change.
At an interest rate of 6 percent on a standard $10,000 bond, you
get a steady $600 per year, no more and no less, and at maturity
you get your $10,000 back _ period.
</P>
<P>
   Sustained inflation of slightly more than 2 percent would cause
inflation-indexed bonds to slightly outperform standard 10-year
Treasuries. That's because a 2.1 percent inflation adjustment is
needed to bridge the gap between the interest rates on the two
securities.
</P>
<P>
   If the annual inflation rate were to jump to 4 percent or higher
and stay there, buyers of inflation-indexed bonds would receive far
better yields than those who buy standard Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   But how likely is that?
</P>
<P>
   In the 12 months ended in April, the CPI did indeed rise by more
than 2 percent _ 2.3 percent, to be precise. That was the first
time inflation edged above the 2 percent mark since the 12-month
period ending in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   However, not since the 12-month period ended June 1991 has
inflation exceeded 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The inflationary surge during the past year was due largely to a
0.7 percent spike during April. That was fueled by soaring energy
costs _ something any buyer of gasoline must have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for certain whether April was the start of an
inflationary trend or just a hiccup. We'll have more evidence
tomorrow, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the CPI
figures for May.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the April CPI report, Greenspan and his
colleagues expressed concern that the economy may be heating up to
the point where inflation could become a menace once again.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the mere fact that Greenspan suddenly seems more
worried than usual about inflation is enough to justify a red
alert.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BONDS15 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``You have to listen to what Alan Greenspan says,'' remarks Jay
A. Kellett, chief executive of KCM Investment Advisors in Larkspur.
``He has more information than any of the rest of us, and he tells
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Most inflation-indexed bonds, officially known as Treasury
Inflation Protection Securities, are sold to institutions and
wealthy individuals in denominations ranging from $1,000 to $5
million. Several billion dollars worth are sold quarterly, with
5-year, 10-year and 30-year maturities. (A new issue of 10-year
bonds is scheduled for July 7.)
</P>
<P>
   Starting late last year, the Treasury also began issuing
inflation-indexed savings bonds, in denominations as small as $50,
to stimulate interest among middle-income investors.
</P>
<P>
   Many financial experts think the Fed will raise interest rates
this month to forestall any further inflationary outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   They figure the rates will go up immediately after a meeting of
the Fed's Open Market Committee, scheduled for June 29 and 30. If
so, it would be the Fed's first rate boost in two years.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed does raise rates, that could cool off the economy and
help nip inflation in the bud _ in which case the argument for
buying inflation-indexed bonds would weaken.
</P>
<P>
   But there will always be a rationale for these bonds, because
they are the only investment whose returns are guaranteed to exceed
gains in the cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   That is no small virtue in itself, and on top of that, the bonds
are backed _ as the familiar saying goes _ by the full faith and
credit of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   With indexed bonds currently providing a 3.9 percent yield above
and beyond inflation, buying them ensures that the real value of
your assets will increase by 47 percent over a 10-year period. Over
a 30-year period, your buying power would more than triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 3.9 percent real return, locked in, is a high real return,''
says Ray Dalio, president of Connecticut's Bridgewater Associates,
which manages an indexed-bond fund for institutional investors.
``Over the last 30 or 35 years, bonds have averaged a 2.7 percent
real return, so 3.9 percent is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Such returns may seem puny compared with the 30 percent per year
that many stock-market investors have earned during the past four
or five years.
</P>
<P>
   But investors should remember that there have been many years
when stocks rose by less than the inflation rate _ to say nothing
of the many years when the market actually fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bonds might be suitable for people who are very
concerned about the stock market,'' says Beverly Tanner of the
Tanner Financial Group in Larkspur.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with standard inflation-indexed bonds is that they
are not taxpayer friendly. (As we shall see, that is not the case
with the inflation-indexed savings bonds.)
</P>
<P>
   Not only must you pay federal taxes every year on the interest
you receive, but also on any inflation-adjusted gains that are made
in your bond's par value. Like other Treasuries, the bonds are
exempt from state and local income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   If the par value is adjusted upward for inflation, the amount of
the increase is taxed that year, even though you don't actually lay
hands on the money until the bond matures. So you would have to dip
into your other assets to pay the tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, financial advisers suggest that investors buy
indexed bonds strictly for tax-free or tax-deferred portfolios,
such as Individual Retirement Accounts. That way, you can escape
the year-to-year tax hassle.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the strict tax rules don't apply to the new
inflation-indexed savings bonds. The tax on any increase in their
value is automatically deferred until the bonds are redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of BONDS15 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Tax on the savings-bond interest is also deferred, because the
interest automatically is reinvested in more bonds.
</P>
<P>
   So there is no strong need to buy the savings bonds for a
standard, tax-deferred IRA account. However, you might consider
buying them for a Roth IRA, where all investment gains accumulate
tax free.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy inflation-indexed Treasuries directly and
commission-free through an account with the Federal Reserve. If you
don't already have an account, you can apply electronically on the
Web at www.frbsf.org or by calling the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco at (415) 974-2000.
</P>
<P>
   You also can buy the bonds in the secondary market, through a
broker. Depending on the broker, you will have to pay a commission
in the range of about $30 to $50 per bond.

 &HT;    Detained immigrant's suit against INS raises hopes for thousands
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Two years ago, Ralph Richardson was a
small businessman who coached his church soccer team and dreamed of
turning his commercial cleaning firm in suburban Atlanta into a big
success.
</P>
<P>
   An unlucky convergence of a new immigration law, a weekend trip
to Haiti and a 7-year-old cocaine-trafficking charge doomed the
33-year-old immigrant's plans. He's spent the last 20 months at
Krome Detention Center near Miami as a criminally tainted
immigrant, awaiting deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's luck could be changing. Converging in his favor are
a growing dissent over the 1996 immigration law and a favorable
June 1 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in his lawsuit, Richardson
vs. the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling _ which private immigration lawyers say promises
relief for thousands of detained immigrants _ ordered the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta to consider Richardson's claim
that his indefinite detention violates the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not out to be a celebrity,'' said Richardson, whose name
is now known to civil rights lawyers and jailed immigrants across
the country. ``I just want to go home to my family. I want to be
free.''
</P>
<P>
   Private immigration attorneys say the 1996 law's intent _ to
deport dangerous felons as they leave prison _ entraps legal
residents whose crimes, including some misdemeanors, were committed
years ago. Some longtime legal residents are caught as they file
for U.S. citizenship. Richardson was arrested in 1997 when he was
passing through Miami International Airport after a two-day trip to
Haiti with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Disenchantment with the law even extends to the immigration
service, which has watched the number of detained immigrants double
to 16,400 since the law's passage.
</P>
<P>
   At Krome, 327 of the detention center's 501 beds are taken up by
immigrants detained because of crimes in their past. The rest are
immigrants caught sneaking into the country or working illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we don't have the space to detain every petty
criminal alien who committed a crime 20 years ago and has since
turned his life around,'' said one high-ranking INS official who
asked not to be named. ``We are just following the law.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Justice Department attorneys representing the INS seemed to
be arguing for the other side. They sided with Richardson, saying
the constitutional issues raised should be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law lowered the threshold of which crimes prompt
deportation. Instead of the ``aggravated felon'' definition
previously used, anyone convicted of a crime carrying a sentence of
one year or more was subject to detention and deportation. The
previous threshold was a five-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, the immigrant faces a virtual life sentence
years after the commission of an often relatively minor offense,''
said Cheryl Little, director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy
Center in Miami. The law, which requires detention until
deportation, makes ``lifers'' out of immigrants from Cuba, Vietnam
and other countries that won't accept them back, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law also is controversial because it bars immigrants
from challenging their detention in court, the issue raised by
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   That violates their constitutional rights, says attorney Joan
Friedland, Little's colleague at the advocacy center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fundamental principle in this country that you have
access to the courts to challenge government decisions,'' Friedland
said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson claims the INS refuses to recognize that he has lived
a crime-free life since his 1990 conviction in Pensacola for
possession of one pound of crack cocaine. He pleaded no contest to
the felony and served 2 1/2 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   While the Supreme Court's ruling in Richardson's case is
significant, it may be muted because many immigrants cannot afford
to hire attorneys to fight their detentions, Friedland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the people most affected by these laws don't have
access to lawyers at all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is being represented at no cost by Ira Kurzban, a
Miami attorney widely known for his advocacy of immigrant rights.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for a ruling from the Alanta appeals court,
Kurzban is fighting in INS administrative courts for his client's
right to be free on bond while challenging his deportation. An
immigration judge in Miami last week said Richardson can petition
to cancel his deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still taking a position that he's not eligible for
release,'' Kurzban said. ``Our position is that he should have
never been detained in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach attorney Stuart Karden is fighting a similar
battle for his client, Jamaican-born Sanguintti McHugh, 47, who was
taken into custody last September on a 1993 possession-of-marijuana
charge.
</P>
<P>
   McHugh, a West Palm Beach carpenter, pleaded guilty and served
42 days in jail in St. Lucie County. Even though a finding of guilt
was withheld, the 1996 immigration law made the plea a deportable
offense, Karden said.
</P>
<P>
   While McHugh sits in an immigration jail in Louisiana, Karden is
seeking bond for his client and trying to withdraw the 1993 plea,
saying the judge never told McHugh that he could be deported.
</P>
<P>
   The Richardson case may be the legal breakthrough, but the INS
and Congress are also taking steps to soften the harsh sanctions of
the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   After a 47-day hunger strike by relatives of Krome detainees
ended in May, INS Commissioner Doris Meissner announced that all
long-term detainees in the country would have their cases reviewed
to see if any are eligible for release.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, six from Krome have been freed, including five
relatives of the hunger strikers. The sixth was an Ethopian Jew,
Lugseged Dhine, who had been held for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of nonviolent, first-time offenders who
deserve to be reviewed,'' Dhine said last week from his home in
Arizona. ``The law was not designed for these kind of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some senators are trying to change the law. Earlier this year,
U.S. Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-NY, proposed restoring court review,
providing court-appointed attorneys for immigrants challenging
detention, and allowing immigrants with criminal punishments of
less than five years to petition for cancellation of deportation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., supports those amendments, which
are now being considered by a Senate sub-committee. Graham met this
week with INS officials in Miami to encourage releasing nonviolent
detainees. An alternative being considered by INS officials is to
place some in half-way houses or other rehabilitative programs.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, one of three senators to vote against the 1996 act, said
the ``one-size fits all'' treatment of ex-offender immigrants is
wrong. Those who cannot be deported to their native countries
``receive the same sentence _ life imprisonment _ without regard to
the seriousness of their crime,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson says so far his battle is being won in small steps.
On Thursday, INS detention officials allowed him to trade his red
jumpsuit _ the color worn by aggravated felons _ to orange. Soon,
he hopes to be reunited with his wife and three children in
Norcross outside of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm praying that that will happen soon,'' Richardson said.
``But, like everything with INS, it's unpredictable.''

 &HT;    Attorneys try to settle fight over messages
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Attorneys for Nancy Fowler and her former support
organization are trying to settle a dispute over the rights to
messages Fowler says she receives from the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Robert Kelley, Fowler's friend and a former member of
Our Loving Mother's Children, said attorneys for both sides are
abiding by a self-imposed gag order while they attempt to negotiate
a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement appears to center on the messages Fowler gave
at her White Road farm in Conyers after her visions of the Virgin
Mary. In a prepared statement, Fowler blamed her dissatisfaction
with OLMC on the group's president, Robert Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I disassociated myself from OLMC Inc., I requested the
return of all the books and videos prepared and published in
support of my mission,'' the statement read. ``The material was
prepared with donations from pilgrims. Mr. Hughes claims that he
and his wife own the material. They continue to market the material
at many times its cost to produce. They do so without my
blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution was unable to reach Hughes for
a response to Fowler's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Fowler asked Rockdale County, Ga. Superior Court
Judge Sidney Nation for a temporary restraining order against OLMC.
Nation's office confirmed the judge signed an order for Fowler, but
a secretary said Nation couldn't remember specifics about what the
order said or what Fowler specifically asked the judge to stop.
Nothing on the case had been filed in the clerk's office by the
close of business Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler's messages ended in 1998 after eight years. During that
time, thousands from the U.S., Mexico and Latin America made the
trip to Conyers to hear the messages, which always were
disseminated on the 13th of the month. During the largest turnouts,
roads were often clogged around the farm, forcing local sheriff's
deputies to direct traffic and monitor the crowds.

 &HT;    Palm Beach County to NFL: Show us the money
 &HT;    By Marcia Gelbart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For their $210,000 to the last two Super
Bowls played in South Florida, Palm Beach officials expect the
National Football League to show the same gratitude it did in
Broward and Miami-Dade counties: a $1 million contribution toward a
new youth center.
</P>
<P>
   That would be something real they could point to as they decide
whether to continue donating in the face of doubts about whether
Palm Beach County's investment is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   The three counties pitch in hundreds of thousands of dollars to
jointly host the games. Boosted with private money, Miami-Dade used
its NFL donation to build a youth facility in 1995; Broward will
open a center this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time, it'll be our turn,'' said Palm Beach County
Commission Chairwoman Maude Ford Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily, according to the NFL. Since 1993, the football
league has built the inner-city facilities, which it calls Youth
Education Towns, in each Super Bowl host city as a tangible legacy
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Since football's ultimate showdown is a tri-county effort when
it's played in South Florida, Palm Beach County officials say they
always thought the benefits would be split three ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment was, we'll do one in Dade and one in Broward,''
said Jim Steeg, the NFL's vice president of special events. The
league agreed to nothing else, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm unaware of any understanding'' among the three counties
and the NFL, said Hank Adorno, chairman of the 1999 host committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may have made some natural assumptions,'' Adorno
continued, ``but nobody should be saying we're getting a new (youth
center), or, even if we did, where it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Next spring, South Florida will make a bid to host the Super
Bowl in Pro Player Stadium in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But talk of the NFL contribution surfaced last week at the
county's Tourist Development Council as members discussed what Palm
Beach County got for its $120,000 contribution to this year's game.
</P>
<P>
   Broward gave $450,000; Miami-Dade donated $600,000, plus about
$1 million in free services, Adorno said.
</P>
<P>
   During the Super Bowl festivities, fewer people stayed in Palm
Beach County hotels than those farther south because it's cheaper
to sleep in Fort Lauderdale, concluded a new report by a consultant
to the tourist council.
</P>
<P>
   A wise investment? Tourism officials couldn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant Palm Beach County Administrator Bill Wilkins
reminded the group of the anticipated youth center. ``We'll get
value for the money we put in,'' Wilkins said. Lee, who chairs the
council as well as the county commission, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a bad trade-off,'' said Warren ``Mac'' McLaughlin,
the county's Convention and Visitors Bureau president and a member
of the host committee board.
</P>
<P>
   If it were built, Lee's impoverished commission district could
be a prime contender. Ultimately, it'll be up to county
commissioners _ who each had the opportunity this year to buy two
Super Bowl tickets at face value from the NFL _ to decide whether
the county contributes to the nextarea Super Bowl.

 &HT;    When children clean rooms it must be 'the last of days'
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ My 17-year-old son cleaned up his room the
other day.
</P>
<P>
   Voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he did it well.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot overstate just how eerie this is. Parents may want to
sit down before reading this next part but, he actually went
downstairs, located the vacuum cleaner, took it upstairs and used
it, and all without needing extensive instruction! He even changed
the burned-out lightbulbs, something I have never seen a child do.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he cleaned a small portion of the room used by his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   And the coup de grace? He cleaned the bathroom. I should mention
here, for those parents who feel faint at the idea of a child
cleaning the bathroom, that is has been less than a week since that
bathroom had been cleaned by an adult, so it was not terribly
dirty.
</P>
<P>
   But I personally was shocked that a child _ particularly a boy _
would ever even come up with the notion that a bathroom needed to
be cleaned, much less take it upon himself to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of you who are experienced parents are waiting for the
punch line, here, you have to be asking yourself, ``OK, what did he
want?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: Nothing. He did not ask for a penny (possibly
because he knows he wouldn't have gotten it). He didn't want to go
to the movies, to stay out late or even to stay up late.
</P>
<P>
   We've made appointments for extensive testing at the Mayo
Clinic. I figure it has to be some strange virus that has entered
his bloodstream from eating one too many gummy bears, maybe some
weird germ mutated by the CIA or the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps this, at last, is proof positve that aliens really
are taking over the bodies of our children. If so, the intelligence
is clearly superior. In any case, I suppose the government will
want to study him, probably at Area 57.
</P>
<P>
   For a fact if Moldy and Sculler (or is that Scoulder and Mully?)
were ever looking for the X-files, the chances were excellent that
they were hidden in my son's room, beneath dirty clothes, candy
wrappers and Mad magazines, safe from detection from any source in
the universe.
</P>
<P>
   I watched the procession of refuse coming from that room on the
suspicion that I might see the X-files, but with no luck. It is,
possible, however, that I saw some X-flies buzzing their way to
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   I had wondered what had happened to most of the eating utensils
in the house. No more, they came out of my son's room and, though
now discovered, may be retired or put into quarantine. Since I need
to lose some weight, I intend to keep the memory of that silverware
coming out of the room. It will certainly make me lose my appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, much more silverware came out than paper plates, which
leads me to the grim conclusion that my son was recycling his paper
plates, or perhaps he was eating his chicken pot pies directly off
the carpet. I avoid, at almost all cost, monitoring any of my
children's eating habits, so I wouldn't really know.
</P>
<P>
   I have, in fact, attempted not to enter any of their rooms, for
fear of what evil might lurk within.
</P>
<P>
   But when I went into my son's room, there was nothing but clean.
The professionals tell you that when a child suddenly changes
habits it is a sign of possible drug use.
</P>
<P>
   If this is so, all I want to know is, where can I enough for the
other three children?

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Lucky Lindy's nightmare
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The traveler began to speak:
</P>
<P>
   ``Every airline has one, but this guy was the original. He was
the one who, in a moment of misconceived altruism, eliminated
smoking. It gave him, strangely, no pleasure. Nothing, it seemed to
him, was like eliminating previously undiscovered cost centers. He
never discussed cutting costs, only efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started by getting rid of complimentary meals in coach. The
savings, when annualized, were astounding. What he really liked was
the sight of agreeable passengers trooping lemming-like into
airplanes carrying brown paper lunch bags filled with meals made of
sawdust. `They're doing it to themselves,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got rid of peanuts by convincing a civil-rights group to
demand peanut-free zones. Soft drinks were next. Common courtesy
was found to have associated costs. He is now at work on a plan to
catheterize passengers as they enter the plane, explaining the
procedure is for 'your comfort and convenience.' Covertly, the
airline will cut the number of restrooms to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is now working on a schedule of fines, the ultimate
objective of which is the total elimination of passengers, who only
impede the air travel process. No-shows objecting to further
efficiencies would be fined. Travelers who showed up with residual
expectations of service would also be fined. Anyone could
eventually be fined for anything the airline perceived as
graceless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is considering eliminating the standard announcement, 'If
there is anything we can do to make your flight more enjoyable,
please do not hesitate to ask.' In 1991, a passenger seems to have
asked to talk to the captain about the ideas of the German
philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibnitz. If
allowed to get out of hand, the costs would be incalculable.''
</P>
<P>
   The traveler made a curious gesture, then moved off into the
shadows.

 &HT;    New apartment, new appliances _ same old ugly pet
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ In August, my son Kristofor is going to be
married. Now that he's finished school in Columbus, he'll be moving
to Philadelphia where Amy, his bride-to-be, already lives. The job
of apartment hunting was dropped onto her most capable shoulders by
default. She recently struck pay dirt. Kristofor filled me in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a newly renovated old home that has been turned into two
apartments. Ours is the second and third floor AND,'' he adds with
emphasis, ``it has all new appliances. That's really important, you
know?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I know. I can still remember the first apartment his
father and I rented, almost 40 years ago. It was two rooms and a
bath near Chicago's Midway Airport ... $135 a month, furniture and
utilities included. And best of all, the stove and refrigerator
were brand new. No matter the floors were a skating rink in winter,
or the upstairs neighbors sounded like elephants line dancing, I
was thrilled with my new appliances (and of course, my new
husband).
</P>
<P>
   ``And the rent is (SET ITAL)only(END ITAL) $850 a month,'' he
slips in and catches me pretty much unaware. ``That's the bottom
end of what we figured we could afford. Isn't that great?''
</P>
<P>
   As a mother and future mother-in-law, I know that my only job is
to wear neutral colors and keep my mouth shut, but in spite of
myself, I flinch.
</P>
<P>
   Kristofor rattles on in praise of virgin stoves and washing
machines while I work on coming to grips with reality. This is not
1959, I remind myself. Get over it. A nasty picture of where these
kids might be living on $135 a month, even without furniture and
utilities, slams home. Does flophouse ring a bell?
</P>
<P>
   Then he tells me they had to cough up two months' rent plus
another $850 pet deposit for Tattinger (his beloved 10-year-old
part-Siamese cat). While I'm focused on how I might have monthly
CARE packages delivered, another creepy (really) thought pops up. I
ask him if he's told (SET ITAL)all(END ITAL) in his pet declaration
to the owner. He pretends not to know what I mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fluffy,'' I remind him. ``Aren't you taking him with you?''
</P>
<P>
   Kristofor registers surprise that I could even bring myself to
ask about his alternative pet and assures me the landlord wouldn't
be concerned about a cockroach in a cage. I tell him he's lucky
because if it were up to me he wouldn't be allowed within the city
limits with that ugly bug.
</P>
<P>
   Fluffy is a Madagascan hissing cockroach. My son found the bug
homeless, wandering the halls outside Kristofor's lab in the
zoology department at Ohio State, and since he was apparently an
escaped experiment, took pity on him. ``I couldn't just let him
die, could I?'' were his exact words. I suggested that cockroaches,
unlike little boys, could make it very nicely on their own and
reminded him they were the only life form known to survive an
</P>
<P>
   atomic blast.
</P>
<P>
   That's how my son ended up sharing his apartment with a roach
the size of a shoebox _ one that he feeds monkey chow and grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Really, I shouldn't have been shocked. This was not his first
attempt to domesticate vermin. A couple of years earlier he had
liberated another pet of the genus (SET ITAL)cockroachus
giganticus(END ITAL). That one he named ``Spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Spot was not well when my son found him, in fact, his crusty
little body was covered in mites. So Kristofor sat down and for the
better part of an afternoon, held the giant cockroach in one hand
and tweezers in the other, picking and grooming until Spot came out
looking like a new roach. Spot thrived until his three-score and
ten (in bug years) was up and his little antenna went belly up. And
now there's Fluffy.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, don't say you haven't been warned.

 &HT;    Retirement investing easy with a 401(k)
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Investing for retirement ought not be scary.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the process is not the easiest thing you'll ever do.
But it is not overwhelmingly complex.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it this way: Complexity is when you learn to play
bridge. Long-term investing is more like staying on a healthful
diet _ it goes on forever, and it requires persistent effort.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, the first step is the hardest. It is the one in
which you start saving some of your money every payday.
</P>
<P>
   This may require you to cut back spending for immediate
gratification. It certainly requires a personal commitment to put
money away and to leave it there, no matter how much you want to
spend it all now.
</P>
<P>
   Investing is, for many people, the fun part. That's when you
make your money work for you.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, there are many reliable sources of guidance for
long-term investing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Mike Scarborough, the proprietor of an Annapolis,
Md., firm that manages $1.7 billion worth of 401(k) retirement
accounts for families and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Here are seven steps he recommends for retirement investors:
</P>
<P>
   1. Participate in company-sponsored investing plans. ``Ten or 15
years ago, it was common to see people put off their investments in
a 401(k),'' Scarborough said. ``Today a lot of young people have
gotten the message: You should begin as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Compounding greatly increases the returns you get
from investments held over a longer period. Suppose you invested
$1,000 in a tax-deferred account and earned an 8 percent annual
return. In 10 years, you would have $2,159. In 20 years it would be
$4,661, and in 30 years it would leap to $10,063.
</P>
<P>
   2. Put in at least enough to grab all the matching money your
company puts in. Companies with 401(k) plans typically put in 50
cents for every $1 a worker contributes, up to 6 percent of the
employee's salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's free money,'' Scarborough said. ``Take all of it that
the company is offering.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Don't invest too much in your company's stock. ``The maximum
investment should be 10 or 15 percent of your portfolio, and that's
on the high side,'' Scarborough said.
</P>
<P>
   4. Don't borrow against your plan. It is true that any interest
on the loan is paid right back into your account. But the interest
is taxable.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, you lose the earnings your money would have made if
you left it in the account.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle H. Flynn, a certified financial planner in Atlanta, pointed
out another pitfall: ``You have to have the discipline to pay it
back. If you don't, you are jeopardizing your future.'' In some
circumstances, an unpaid loan balance can turn into an early
withdrawal, Flynn said. That means you will have to pay both income
taxes and a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   5. Understand your time horizon. ``It is long-term, very
long-term,'' Scarborough pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   If you have decided to put 50 percent of your new contributions
into stocks, stay with that allocation even when the market goes
down.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you can select a low-cost index fund, use it. ``I think
that using index funds as the core of a portfolio makes sense,''
said Scarborough. ``But to index your whole savings plan to one
index is foolhardy.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Rebalance as necessary. Suppose you want 50 percent of your
investments in large-company stock mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The booming stock market may have pushed that allocation far
beyond 50 percent. In that case, you can pull a portion of your
money out of the large-cap fund and divert it into other,
not-so-fast-growing categories.
</P>
<P>
   In a tax-deferred account such as an IRA or a 401(k), there is
no tax penalty for this buying and selling. Scarborough warned,
however, that fund managers may impose a penalty for too-frequent
switching
</P>
<P>
   7. Don't panic. If the market takes a dive, don't cash in all
your stock investments. Remember, these are long-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of people panic when the market drops 10
percent,'' said William J. Kring, a certified financial planner in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're talking about is market timing, and that never
works. The market goes down and you get out. Then the market goes
up and you're still out. Getting out is easy. It's much harder to
convince yourself to get back in.''

 &HT;    Good mornings, competitive mornings ahead for networks
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A commercial break during the ``Today'' show, and
deep inside Rockefeller Center, the old Warren Zevon song
``Werewolves of London'' is blasting in the production booth for
Studio 1A.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahh-ooooh!'' executive producer Jeff Zucker, his necktie flung
back over his left shoulder, howls along. Even though the 6 million
or so viewers around the country are watching a string of ads,
NBC's ``Today'' show is rockin' 'n' rollin'.
</P>
<P>
   Is it ever. ``Today,'' the first of the morning news shows when
it debuted in 1952, is amazingly dominant in the late '90s _ it's
been the No. 1 morning show for 181 straight weeks, almost 3 1/2
years, and its ratings' lead over ``Good Morning America'' and
``CBS This Morning'' is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   It's had two of the most talked-about TV news interviews of the
year _ Matt Lauer's relentless questions to Monica Lewinsky and
Katie Couric's long interview with two surviving relatives of the
Littleton, Colo., victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' doesn't even need a Ricky Martin concert to make the
crowd outside go nuts, but it had that, too, last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, look out ``Today,'' 'cause it's only getting harder
from here on out. In September, ``Good Morning America'' (which has
been moving back up in the ratings with Diane Sawyer and Charlie
Gibson) moves into its new studio overlooking Times Square, which
means ``GMA'' can play to adoring crowds outside as well. And in
November, CBS unwraps its new revamped show with Bryant Gumbel as
anchor and its own street-side studio on Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing worries me,'' acknowledges Lauer. ``I don't
walk around feeling all that confident.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think about it?'' says Zucker about the competition.
``How about every hour?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fall,'' Zucker adds, ``everybody is going to be paying
attention to the prime-time schedule and who's going to win which
time slot. But the toughest battle is probably going to be here in
the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the breakfast wars, it's all about the anchors, obviously,
and how they connect with viewers, making them feel, ideally, like
they're inviting wise and warm friends into their kitchens and
bedrooms. And it's all about the news, and who delivers it fast,
smooth and in the right-size chunks. But maybe, most of all, it's
all about having a studio that opens out onto a Manhattan street
and gathers a big, noisy crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that nobody leaves a Broadway musical humming the
set,'' says Steve Friedman, a former veteran ``Today'' producer
who's been tapped by CBS to oversee the new Gumbel show. ``But you
gotta compete in the location wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings an instant energy,'' says Lauer of the several
hundred people (many more when ``Today'' does one of its Friday
summer concerts) who gather each day in Rockefeller Plaza to wave
their signs and jostle for on-camera face time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was skeptical at first,'' says Couric. ``But people enjoy
it, they feel like it's a happening.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ``Werewolves of London'' morning, the crowd outside in
Rockefeller Plaza is typical, armed with instant cameras, signs
(``You talked to my grandma _ Why not me?'') and autograph books.
Jim Raskob, a pharmaceutical salesman from Minneapolis in town for
a convention, has shown up carrying a sign that says ``Hi, Mom!''
for his mother's 60th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best I could do,'' he says of the unoriginal sign.
``But I didn't misspell anything!''
</P>
<P>
   Couric comes out to play on a trapeze set up in the plaza
(``Sometimes I can't believe the things they ask me to do!'' she
says later, but she also knows she's a former gymnast and could
manage it).
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so perky!'' gushes a woman in the crowd, who then
quickly adds, ``I'll bet she gets tired of hearing that.'' She
does.
</P>
<P>
   This is some of what ABC and CBS hope to copy, or capture,
although both say they'll do it differently from ``Today.''
Producers of both competitors say they'll use the window on the
crowd less, and ``Good Morning America's'' studio will be on the
second floor rather than on the ground floor such as ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   As for copying, Friedman laughs. He was executive producer of
``Today'' when the street-side studio was being planned. ``If I
can't rip myself off, who can I rip off?''
</P>
<P>
   ``So much is made of the race and the ratings,'' Couric says in
one of her two offices after she's done outside. ``It's very
cyclical. Things change, but they change very slowly in morning
television.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that truism _ that it takes a very long time for viewers to
change their morning habits _ that is working against ABC and CBS
as they strive to catch ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When people go out to dinner, they order Italian one night,
steak the next night, whatever they're in the mood for,'' says
Shelley Ross, executive producer of ``Good Morning America.'' ``But
for breakfast, they want their toast dry, their bacon crisp, their
eggs a certain way, the same way every day.''
</P>
<P>
   What's working in their favor is that morning news is the only
area in network television where the audience is growing rather
than shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four years, the total audience for the three
morning shows is up, from 12.1 million to 12.8 million _ about six
percent. During that same period, the audience for ``ER,'' the No.
1 show in prime time, is down almost 20 percent, typical of what's
happening to the broadcast networks everywhere but in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are asking why would Diane Sawyer come to morning
television, why would Bryant Gumbel come back?'' says Zucker.
``(It's because) morning news is the only growth market in all of
network television.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons, all three morning show producers agree: people are
getting up earlier because commutes are longer, some people are
working out in the mornings, and more people are seeking quick hits
on news, as well as traffic and weather information from local
morning news, which is also up in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get up at 6:30 in the morning and put on an HBO
movie,'' notes Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ABC and CBS face formidable odds. ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' squandered strong ratings, clumsily shuffled anchor teams
and de-emphasized hard news until it brought in Sawyer and Gibson
to stabilize the show. The ratings have finally climbed back to
where they were under the old team of Gibson and Joan Lunden, but
the buzz in the news biz is: How long will Sawyer, a $7 million a
year superstar, continue to get up at 4 a.m. to save ABC's morning
bacon?
</P>
<P>
   She's signed through May of 2000, and may stay longer to make a
smooth transition to the next anchor or team. ``The errors that
'GMA' made in the past of just popping in new people won't
happen,'' vows Ross.
</P>
<P>
   At least ``GMA'' has success in its past; in the '80s and early
'90s, it was the No. 1 morning show, well ahead of ``Today.'' CBS's
morning track record is 40 years of utter failure, with hosts
ranging from Walter Cronkite to Paula Zahn (and a younger Diane
Sawyer) never getting out of third place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we're doomed or we're due,'' says producer Friedman,
fatalistically. With his studio under construction, Friedman is
looking for a co-anchor for Gumbel, and the rumor mill has churned
out names such as Deborah Norville and Elizabeth Vargas so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for someone who is fun, who can stand up to
Bryant,'' Friedman says. ``With all due respect to Katie Couric,
who was Katie Couric before she got the job?''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, she's the center of attention in Rockefeller Plaza,
dangling from a trapeze and grinning gamely as the crowd chants
``Katie! Katie! Katie!'' There is no doubt, at least for right now,
who's Number One.

 &HT;    Small groups kidnap forums for their own purposes
 &HT;    By Charles Stough
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Usenet forum was for owners of Chia pets,
those ceramic animals from mail-order TV. And there in the list of
subjects was a query from someone desperate to keep her dog from
chasing cars.
</P>
<P>
   A chia dog that chases cars? That would be worth sending a
photographer, if those TV prowl vans don't beat us to it.
</P>
<P>
   And there was another pottery-pet question asking whether a
mother cat would adopt a kitten from someone else's litter. And
some advice on controlling fleas (another startling problem,
considering recent advances in ceramic technology). And someone
complaining that her landlord won't let her keep a ferret.
</P>
<P>
   Wondering why a landlord would object to a pottery ferret, which
after all is no noisier nor destructive to drapes than a pottery
turtle, I had to look. And I found technological kidnapping, right
there in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   A group of pet owners had found the abandoned Usenet newsgroup
alt.pets.chia and simply adopted it as a mini-forum of their own.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of pet owners' newsgroups, covering many breeds
of dogs and cats, exotic birds, aquariums, horses, farm animals,
and even one for dragons. But they can be big and noisy, with
hundreds of postings a day. That might mean a glutted mailbox for
those who read newsgroups as e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The alt.pets.chia group seems to be about 12 people, and they
have many kinds of pets. But they have come to know each other in
the Net and enjoy one another's electronic company, so they meet in
``a.p.c.''
</P>
<P>
   In small towns of the world, the same thing happens face-to-face
at park benches or coffee shops or beauty parlors. Why not in
Usenet, which is very much like a meeting place? Anyone on the
Internet can go there for free.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 20,000 Usenet forums. How alt.pets.chia ever
was formed is a mystery. Starting forums used to involve writing a
charter for the group, announcing it, letting all users vote on
whether it's worthwhile or not, and waiting for the results.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups got voted down, though with alt.pets.chia there, I
can't imagine what the losers must have been.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, I went looking for other abandoned forums. But unused
groups are hard to find. Here are some early search failures:
</P>
<P>
   _ Alt.angst. Sorry, big crowd. Suffice to say that the times are
not as untroubled as the Dow Jones industrial average would imply.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alt.bogus.group. Already taken over. Many users seem to be
refugees from alt.devilbunnies, a fun fantasy group who pretend
that the world has been invaded by alien raiders disguised as
cuddly bunnies, evil and predatory and indistinguishable from
genuine cuddly bunnies. A harmless game. Or maybe they're right.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alt.barney.dinosaur.die.die.die. In use. Don't even go there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alt.culture.oregon. Surprise, there's culture in Oregon. There
is no group named alt.culture.ohio, by the way. Draw from that any
conclusion you want. They have Sasquatch, oceanfront and year-round
temperate climate. We have bankrupt schools, a ballpark being built
on a poison pool under eight inches of concrete, and E-check. Who
needs culture?
</P>
<P>
   _ Alt.fan.dan-quayle. Yes, well, if we could trust people from
Indiana we wouldn't make them live in another time zone.Alt.fan.u2.
Rock music fans just won't give up.
</P>
<P>
   Usenet forums are accessible through local Internet service
providers or by going to Deja News' Web site, www.dejanews.com. Go
there and form your own friendships.

 &HT;    College-bound students, parents, try to play the college loan
game
 &HT;    By Angela Townsend
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ After the caps and gowns have been returned, the
parties thrown and the rejection letters thrown away, the real
business of being a would-be college student begins.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Economics 101: Footing the Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Amber Meyers has that part under control. On June 5 she
graduated from Franklin High School. In August she starts her civil
engineering studies at the University of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Because Meyers, 18, started the scholarship and student loan
hunt during her junior year, she has lined up enough grants and
scholarships to cover half of her tuition, and an additional $6,000
in Perkins and subsidized Stafford loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit more that I need, but for the most part
I'm pretty well covered,'' said Meyers, who began an internship
this week with the City of Kettering, Ohio, part of her financial
aid package.
</P>
<P>
   The college-bound most likely have become experts in their own
right in the world of student loans. But there's a whole new crop _
students and parents _ who haven't a clue where to turn.
</P>
<P>
   If you're headed to college in the fall and haven't started
looking into student loans at all, you're awfully late, but not
without hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``If students were starting the process now at Wright State,
they wouldn't receive smaller campus-based funds (ie. the Federal
Supplemental Educational Opportunity grant, Federal Perkins loan or
federal work-study),'' said Jennifer Penick, associate director of
financial aid officer at Wright State University whose office is
dealing with last-minute financial aid processing for the
winding-down school yea, summer and for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But she emphasized that there is still aid out there to be had.
``There's still time to apply for federal financial aid and to
receive major types of federal and state funding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers admits she didn't know what she was getting into before
her junior year. The first person in her family to attend college
right out of high school, Meyers said she was ``kind of dumb to the
fact. It was, 'Oh, you've got four years, don't worry about it.'
But then by the middle of senior year, you realize, 'You've gotta
pay for college.' ``
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, guidance counselors, college financial aid
offices and financial institutions with whom you're familiar are
the first places to stop.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with the expansion of the Internet, has made
navigating the student loan process less of a headache and more of
a gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that you would go to your local bank, savings
and loan, or credit union and apply for a federal loan,'' said Mark
Cannon, a Miami University alumnus who serves as executive director
of the Coalition for Student Loan Reform, a Washington, D.C.-based
organization of state and private student loan companies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent times, however, mergers have made banks more
specialized in nature, with some emerging as student loan
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, while legally still required to involve a bank
in the process as a trustee, are now becoming all-inclusive
lenders, originating loans under their own name and taking care of
all repayment obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Family Education Loan Program's $33 billion annual
program has made student loans big business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really gearing a lot of our products and services to be
able to provide loan services and products via the Web,'' said Jim
Eickhoff, senior vice president for business development and
marketing for Cincinnati-based Student Loan Funding Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Like other lenders across the country, SLFR offers its own brand
of loans. Its Jump Start Stafford loan was made available for the
first time in 1997 to Ohio students and to out-of-state students
attending Ohio schools. All recipients must be eligible for either
subsidized or unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides the greatest savings. They can do no better in
Ohio,'' Eickhoff said. Based on the new federal interest rate for
Stafford loans, JumpStart's new rate should be 5.42 percent in
1999-2000, provided that payments are made on time and SLFR's
EasyPay program (their automated bank account deduction program) is
used.
</P>
<P>
   While SLFR has obviously established itself in the lending
community _ since 1984 the company has provided more than $4.5
billion in financial aid to 730,000 students, primarily in Ohio,
with $1.1 billion in loans granted for the 1998-99 school year
alone _ it is just one of countless lenders that students and
parents need to research. Finding the one that fits your individual
needs, such as discounted interest rate payments, account access
and flexible repayment alternatives is essential.
</P>
<P>
   The gateway to financial aid is the four-page FAFSA (Free
Application for Federal Student Aid), a mandatory form for college
students. Once filed, colleges use the ``expected family
contribution'' established by the FAFSA and the individual
colleges' costs to determine if accepted students are eligible for
subsidized or unsubsidized loans as part of its financial aid
package.
</P>
<P>
   Each college typically provides students with a list of
preferred lenders with whom they already have a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The whole student aid path _ including a one-page promissory
note that collects borrower information, certifications and promise
to re-pay the loan _ usually takes no more than four weeks to
process.
</P>
<P>
   The process seems cut-and-dried, but that doesn't eliminate the
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest ones is, 'Am I eligible? Do I make too much
money?' `` said Denise Rossitto, spokeswoman for Washington,
D.C.-based Sallie Mae (Student Loan Marketing Association).
``People tend to think (that option) is beyond reach for
middle-class families.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been the case since 1992, when the federal
government created unsubsidized loans for students from middle- and
upper-income families, regardless of income.
</P>
<P>
   What's New?
</P>
<P>
   With the recent trend in dropping student loan interest rates _
and with tax incentives and early-payment programs _ more people
are finding student loans more affordable. Each summer Congress
sets the maximum federal loan interest rates (meaning Stafford loan
lenders can go below that rate as low as they want). Last July 1
the Department of Treasury reset the rate to 6.86 percent (while a
student is enrolled) and 7.46 percent (during repayment), the
lowest rate in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years other major changes have made to make the
borrowing process easier for students and parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Master Promissory Note is a new Stafford loan
application/promissory note for the 1999-2000 academic year that
cuts down on paperwork for institutions and borrowers of Stafford
loans.
</P>
<P>
   At the discretion of each individual college, the MPN will be
used as of July 1 as a multi-year promissory note. Students will
have to fill out the form _ basically a promise that they will pay
the money back _ only once during their enrollment in a four-year
or graduate school, as long as he or she stays at that school, and
continues to borrow from the same lender.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Mae is testing a new student loan program called
Laureate, which would give colleges the ability to provide loans
for students through the Internet, with three schools. It plans to
expand its test program to 50 more schools in the upcoming school
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real anxious to get this across all campuses in the
country. The whole management access for financial aid officers is
just unbelievable,'' Rossitto said. ``The program will get the loan
applied for, approved, guaranteed and funds dispersed within 24
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers credits her high school guidance counselors and family
friends with steering her in the right direction. Despite having to
re-think her college choice (the University of Notre Dame topped
her list) after looking at finances, Meyers can't wait to become a
UD freshman.
</P>
<P>
   She's also looking toward the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``My little brother is a freshman in high school,'' Meyers said.
``I'm telling him to start all of this earlier than me.''

right out of high school, Meyers said she was ``kind of dumb to the
fact. It was, 'Oh, you've got four years, don't worry about it.'
But then by the middle of senior year, you realize, 'You've gotta
pay for college.' ``
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, guidance counselors, college financial aid
offices and financial institutions with whom you're familiar are
the first places to stop.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with the expansion of the Internet, has made
navigating the student loan process less of a headache and more of
a gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that you would go to your local bank, savings
and loan, or credit union and apply for a federal loan,'' said Mark
Cannon, a Miami University alumnus who serves as executive director
of the Coalition for Student Loan Reform, a Washington, D.C.-based
organization of state and private student loan companies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent times, however, mergers have made banks more
specialized in nature, with some emerging as student loan
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, while legally still required to involve a bank
in the process as a trustee, are now becoming all-inclusive
lenders, originating loans under their own name and taking care of
all repayment obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Family Education Loan Program's $33 billion annual
program has made student loans big business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really gearing a lot of our products and services to be
able to provide loan services and products via the Web,'' said Jim
Eickhoff, senior vice president for business development and
marketing for Cincinnati-based Student Loan Funding Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Like other lenders across the country, SLFR offers its own brand
of loans. Its Jump Start Stafford loan was made available for the
first time in 1997 to Ohio students and to out-of-state students
attending Ohio schools. All recipients must be eligible for either
subsidized or unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides the greatest savings. They can do no better in
Ohio,'' Eickhoff said. Based on the new federal interest rate for
Stafford loans, JumpStart's new rate should be 5.42 percent in
1999-2000, provided that payments are made on time and SLFR's
EasyPay program (their automated bank account deduction program) is
used.
</P>
<P>
   While SLFR has obviously established itself in the lending
community _ since 1984 the company has provided more than $4.5
billion in financial aid to 730,000 students, primarily in Ohio,
with $1.1 billion in loans granted for the 1998-99 school year
alone _ it is just one of countless lenders that students and
parents need to research. Finding the one that fits your individual
needs, such as discounted interest rate payments, account access
and flexible repayment alternatives is essential.
</P>
<P>
   The gateway to financial aid is the four-page FAFSA (Free
Application for Federal Student Aid), a mandatory form for college
students. Once filed, colleges use the ``expected family
contribution'' established by the FAFSA and the individual
colleges' costs to determine if accepted students are eligible for
subsidized or unsubsidized loans as part of its financial aid
package.
</P>
<P>
   Each college typically provides students with a list of
preferred lenders with whom they already have a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The whole student aid path _ including a one-page promissory
note that collects borrower information, certifications and promise
to re-pay the loan _ usually takes no more than four weeks to
process.
</P>
<P>
   The process seems cut-and-dried, but that doesn't eliminate the
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest ones is, 'Am I eligible? Do I make too much
money?' `` said Denise Rossitto, spokeswoman for Washington,
D.C.-based Sallie Mae (Student Loan Marketing Association).
``People tend to think (that option) is beyond reach for
middle-class families.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been the case since 1992, when the federal
government created unsubsidized loans for students from middle- and
upper-income families, regardless of income.
</P>
<P>
   What's New?
</P>
<P>
   With the recent trend in dropping student loan interest rates _
and with tax incentives and early-payment programs _ more people
are finding student loans more affordable. Each summer Congress
sets the maximum federal loan interest rates (meaning Stafford loan
lenders can go below that rate as low as they want). Last July 1
the Department of Treasury reset the rate to 6.86 percent (while a
student is enrolled) and 7.46 percent (during repayment), the
lowest rate in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years other major changes have made to make the
borrowing process easier for students and parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Master Promissory Note is a new Stafford loan
application/promissory note for the 1999-2000 academic year that
cuts down on paperwork for institutions and borrowers of Stafford
loans.
</P>
<P>
   At the discretion of each individual college, the MPN will be
used as of July 1 as a multi-year promissory note. Students will
have to fill out the form _ basically a promise that they will pay
the money back _ only once during their enrollment in a four-year
or graduate school, as long as he or she stays at that school, and
continues to borrow from the same lender.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Mae is testing a new student loan program called
Laureate, which would give colleges the ability to provide loans
for students through the Internet, with three schools. It plans to
expand its test program to 50 more schools in the upcoming school
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real anxious to get this across all campuses in the
country. The whole management access for financial aid officers is
just unbelievable,'' Rossitto said. ``The program will get the loan
applied for, approved, guaranteed and funds dispersed within 24
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers credits her high school guidance counselors and family
friends with steering her in the right direction. Despite having to
re-think her college choice (the University of Notre Dame topped
her list) after looking at finances, Meyers can't wait to become a
UD freshman.
</P>
<P>
   She's also looking toward the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``My little brother is a freshman in high school,'' Meyers said.
``I'm telling him to start all of this earlier than me.''

 &HT;    Black farmers reap benefits from years of discrimination
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAHOKEE, Fla. _ In the land of sugar barons, C.R. Martin is an
unusual thing indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he a farmer, but he is a black man.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to say it has not always been this way. That
once, when the fields of rich muck stretching east from Lake
Okeechobee were farmed by farmers, not corporations, there were
many C.R. Martins. That after riding on the back of a cattle truck
50 years ago _ two days and two nights wrapped in a quilt as much
to keep out the cold as the angry stares _ Martin and other black
men recruited as cheap labor from the red clay hills of North
Mississippi arrived to find white men willing to sell them seed,
tractors and land.
</P>
<P>
   But that would not happen. Sharecropping was fine for a black
man. But owning a farm?
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. Department of Agriculture, formed in 1862 to
assist farmers, turned its back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to borrow money one time and the man said, 'We can't
loan you the money because it won't be in the budget.' They wasn't
going to loan it to me if they had it in the budget,'' Martin
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It would take 38 years of hard work and saving. Long days
hunched in a white man's field, long days pumping gas and then
years and years _ 27 in all _ working the loading dock for a local
produce broker.
</P>
<P>
   After all that, C.R. Martin got his farm in 1988; a 20-acre bean
field near Pahokee that even with his savings he had to borrow to
buy. And then, it took only one bad freeze to nearly lose it.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because being a small farmer is hard and being a small
black farmer is nearly impossible. When a crop is lost, credit is
the only way to survive and credit can be hard to come by. Black
farmers for years have struggled with the USDA, their government
loans delayed past planting time or inexplicably rejected. At last
count in 1997, only 18,000 of America's 1.9 million farms were
owned by blacks. Palm Beach County had only 18; only four earned
more than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, as small farms collapsed under the weight of
competition from mega growers, black farms perished at nearly twice
the rate of white farms. Black farmers understood why it was so
difficult. But it wasn't until April that the rest of the world
learned: A federal class-action lawsuit initiated by a third
generation North Carolina farmer against the USDA was settled for
an estimated $2.25 billion, the largest civil rights settlement in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, farmers who were discriminated against
between 1981 and 1997 will get $50,000 each and have their debts,
many amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars, erased.
(Farmers with strong proof of discrimination may pursue larger
damages.)
</P>
<P>
   Farmers like C.R. Martin, largely concentrated in the South, are
now filing claims. They have met by the hundreds in Tallahassee and
Tampa. South Florida farmers meet next month at the University of
Miami. Eventually, attorneys anticipate between 20,000 and 30,000
claims nationwide, said Miami attorney Sidney Calloway, whose Miami
firm is handling the Florida claims.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing opinion approving the settlement, U.S. District
Judge Paul Friedman blamed the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty acres and a mule. The government broke that promise to
African-American farmers. Over one hundred years later, the USDA
broke its promise to Mr. James Beverly (a hog farmer from Nottaway
County, Va.). It promised him a loan to build farrowing houses so
that he could breed hogs. Because he was African-American, he never
received that loan,'' Friedman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is happy. At a hearing in March in Washington,
400 farmers, including the lead plaintiff, packed a federal
courtroom to object.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, they say, is while the settlement provides money _
a meager amount in farm dollars _ it doesn't give the farmers back
their land. It doesn't force the government to set up rules to make
sure this never happens again. And, to be eligible to file a claim,
farmers must have filed a discrimination complaint before 1997.
Many, conditioned by years of oppression, never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorneys sold us out,'' said Gary Grant, a
second-generation farmer and president of the North Carolina-based
Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association, which hosted a
meeting this weekend to decide what to do. ``They get to see the
money at the end of the tunnel and forget, if not for us, they
wouldn't have'' the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   For years, reports on the status of black farmers have warned of
their march toward extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the turn of the century, 60 percent of employed
blacks were farmers or worked on a farm, according to a 1982 report
by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. At a peak in 1920, black
farms numbered 926,000.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming lynchings (62 percent of the cotton-growing counties
had at least one between 1900 and 1931), bans on voting rights and
difficulty buying decent land, fertilizer and even seed, they
succeeded on their own terms, creating banks and black agricultural
universities such as Florida A&AMP;M University, which opened in 1887.
</P>
<P>
   Essie Robinson's father tried to escape the racism of the deep
South by starting over in South Florida. What he found in Delray
Beach in 1901 was a brutal sharecropping system _ a new form of
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``After daddy harvested the first crop, he found out the man
wanted to take (more than half his crop). He said no, it isn't
going to happen that way. So by moonlight he would harvest his
crop,'' said Robinson, 81. ``He did that the whole season and after
that he said no more sharecropping. So he bought land and farmed
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   When the bottom fell out of the cotton market in 1914 and the
boll weevil decimated crops seven years later, no one suffered more
than black farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1930 and 1978, the number of white farms dropped from
5.4 million to 2.4 million. Black farms vanished at a much more
precipitous rate: from 882,852 to 57,271.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Dad couldn't get a loan. He had to scuffle,'' said
Osborne Woods, 73, whose father migrated from the Bahamas and
farmed in what is now Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   When Charles Massengill, the son of a sharecropper who moved
from Dawson, Ga., in 1939, quit his job at Everglades Flower
Growers to start a gladiola farm, he found a white partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have farmed on my own,'' Massengill, 77, said.
``Things started to change up in the '60s. But before that . . . a
black man couldn't drive a bulldozer.''
</P>
<P>
   While the civil rights movement grew, much of the farming world
remained mired in racism.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1965, a Civil Rights Commission study found the USDA
discriminated against the 250,000 remaining black farmers. In 1980,
the agency suggested loans and other programs to help small and
minority-owned farms. But in 1981, 95 percent of the loans on
average still went to whites.
</P>
<P>
   When in 1982 the Civil Rights report warned that black farmers
would disappear altogether by 2000 if the agency failed to help,
USDA officials scoffed, saying they had no ``jurisdiction to make
loans for social purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Racism had so thoroughly infected the agency that many farmers
began speaking out. Still, in 1983, President Reagan disbanded the
USDA's Office of Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Black farmers repeatedly had loans denied or faced demands for
excessive collateral, Judge Friedman found.
</P>
<P>
   A Virginia farmer received a loan, but was forced to get
approval from a county official to make withdrawals. The Rev.
Walter Campbell, the son of a Georgia sharecropper, received
thousands in loans, but almost always too late. In 1997, he lost
the Pompano Beach house he built himself after his debt grew to
$338,929.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the money when we didn't need it and didn't get it when
we did need it,'' said Campbell, 77. ``We knew what they was giving
us, we wouldn't be able to pay back. But they said when we sold
(our crops) they'd take a certain percentage. They said they'd
never take my house.''
</P>
<P>
   When his house was auctioned, Campbell's attorney bought it.
Campbell now pays him $400 a month to rent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up in the hole really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Moses Crawford joined him there. Crawford leased 250 acres in
Immokalee, but in 1987 a freeze wiped out his crops. He borrowed
$200,000 to get back on his feet, he said. Instead, the government
took his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought the house the day President Kennedy got killed,''
said Crawford, who now runs a produce stand and butcher shop in
North Miami and rents an apartment. ``I paid $13,000 and added on
to that house. It had five bedrooms by the time I was finished.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996 black farmers marched on Washington and finally
got the USDA's attention, Gary Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of meetings around the country, Secretary of
Agriculture Dan Glickman conceded discriminatory practices in
February 1997 and vowed to reestablish a civil rights division.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year later, Judge Friedman certified a lawsuit filed
by the North Carolina farmer as a class action.
</P>
<P>
   Martin heard about the lawsuit after a segment aired on 60
Minutes and called his brother, who worked for Jet magazine. The
next day his brother called with an attorney's phone number. Martin
attended meetings in Alabama, Georgia and Tallahassee and filed his
claim in May.
</P>
<P>
   At a Tallahassee meeting in May organized by attorney Calloway,
about 100 farmers waited hours to talk to lawyers in an auditorium
at FAMU. Among them was Gurley Anderson, 77, who lost his left arm
feeding sugar cane into a mill 50 years ago and farmed for another
40 years, growing corn, okra and peanuts on his Whigham, Ga., farm
before his home and equipment were sold to pay debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took everything,'' he said. The $50,000 claim ``sure will
be some help to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say money is only a quick fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary of agriculture and the department view the
settlement as the answer to the problem and it's only part of the
answer,'' said John Zippert, a spokesman for the Federation of
Southern Cooperatives. ``We also want to encourage their children
and young people to see the possibility of making a decent living
farming. Of those 18,000 (remaining black farmers), less than 1,000
are under the age of 35 and less than 200 are under 25.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway said the lawsuit was never intended to resolve all the
problems. ``There's probably other lawsuits down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Martin, who received a letter demanding
repayment of $285,000 within a month of filing his discrimination
complaint in 1997, sits ``blowing in the wind,'' waiting for his
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he and others persist, following the seasons, tied to a
cycle that has shaped their lives. Martin keeps his Pahokee field
plowed, hoping his children will lend him seed and fertilizer money
for his fall bean crop.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, against all odds, another black farmer appeared
in Palm Beach County. Fitzroy Douglas, 40, a Jamaican, started his
own farm of spinach, cabbage and other vegetables on 19 leased
acres in the Glades after working at U.S. Sugar for 21 years.
(Starting as a cane cutter, he rose to assistant manager of an
11,000-acre farm.) It has taken him five years to get it off the
ground, a struggle that has left him bitter but determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do so good I can give up my job and I can take care
of my family. But I know it's a long way down the road.''

   POSTPARTUM-BLUES (Albany, N.Y.) _ For one in every 10 new
mothers, the months after delivery offer a profound sense of

   CARMEL, Calif. _ While President Clinton bragged about how
bombing won the war, President Boris Yeltsin felt betrayed. Russia
had played the key role in securing Yugoslavia's acquiescence to
the peace settlement. In return Yeltsin had expected a major role
in the administration of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But once the peace treaty was signed, Russia's legitimate
expectations were brushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for a fait accompli. In a breathtaking display
of political audacity, the Russians moved swiftly into Pristina.
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea and its commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of
the United States, were caught unaware. So were Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   Even Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov seemed in the dark.
Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson of Britain, head of the NATO security
force, hit a stone wall. A Russian victory column rolled past the
cheering crowds in Pristina in full view of CNN cameras. The first
NATO contingent was not due to arrive until the next morning.
Whether Washington liked it or not, Moscow had asserted its right
to play a central role in Kosovo. And to remind the world that the
United Nations, not NATO, was supposed to be in charge of the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's goal, since its inception in 1949, has been to maintain
U.S. influence in Europe, to hold Germany down and to keep Russia
out.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, NATO's plan was to include the United States, Germany
and the rest of the alliance at the core of the peacekeeping
effort. Russia would be excluded until alliance troops were firmly
ensconced in their various sectors. Eventually the Russians would
be permitted entry, in limited numbers, ``folded in'' under NATO
command and control. They would not have their own sector.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would they have a voice in controlling the Pristina airport,
an essential entry point in a landlocked country with a degraded
infrastructure. Moscow would have had no independent voice in
NATO's governance of Kosovo. If Russia wanted to send in additional
troops, it would have to secure permission from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the Russian dash into Pristina to establish their presence,
to challenge NATO dominance, and to provide a safe haven for the
Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
   Washington may proclaim the myth that NATO bombing alone made
Milosevic desperate to get a peace treaty. But after 78 days, was
Milosevic all that desperate? He is still the ruler of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO did not win this war militarily. Rather, this war ended in
a negotiated settlement. Ultimately, it was not NATO bombing nor
hollow threats of land warfare, nor fear of war crime indictments
that brought about peace. NATO is in Kosovo today because of
Russia's good offices.
</P>
<P>
   Had it not been for Russian participation, there would be no
peace treaty, we would be still bombing Belgrade, and the Americans
and the British would be gearing up for an unpopular ground war
that would begin as winter sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Germany, Italy, and certainly Greece would be
distancing themselves from the conflict. Russia's diplomacy
prevented catastrophe, not merely for the Serbs, but for the
Balkans and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Now is not the time to challenge the Russians in Kosovo. The
situation is far too polarized and dangerous and NATO needs all the
help it can get.
</P>
<P>
   Russian engagement in peacekeeping will help dispel anti-NATO
suspicions and allay Serbian concerns. Ethnic hatreds are at a
boiling point. The Russians can help ease the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Unless we want to start the Cold War all over again, with the
fault line running through the Balkans, Russia must be incorporated
into the effort as an equal partner.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is still a potential threat to American security, as
Serbia never was nor can be. It would be unwise to forget that the
Kremlin still has nuclear weapons and missile systems against which
the United States has no defense.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is, in fact, the essential ally that can provide
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, after its bombing campaign, is perceived as having a bias
against the Serbs. True, the bulk of Yugoslav troops have
withdrawn, but neither side has been disarmed. Of all things, the
allies must avoid a protracted guerrilla war in Kosovo with Serb
paramilitaries on one side, the Kosovar Albanians on the other and
peacekeeping forces in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, as an integral part of the allied force, just might
provide the necessary balance.

BIGGER WORRIES THAN BURNING FLAGS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It was a good question, an excellent one to deal
with, actually, just after Flag Day.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who'd called me said his name was Joe. ``What I want to
know,'' he was saying, ``is how this flag desecration amendment is
going to work. What if the thing I burn isn't really a flag? What
if it's, say, a tablecloth with the image of the flag on it? What
if it's a towel with the flag printed on it?
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm getting at,'' Joe was saying, ``is whether I can get
arrested if I burn an old flag _ say, one with 48 stars instead of
50? If it's not an official flag any more, can they throw me in
jail for that?''
</P>
<P>
   I asked him, do you plan to burn any flags anytime soon? If so,
please call me first so I can watch you do it. And then punch you
right in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   No, Joe said, he would never burn a flag. He was in the service.
He'd served under that flag. He just was unclear on how the
flag-burning amendment would work.
</P>
<P>
   He also wasn't all that crazy about it, either. Why do we need a
thing like this, he wanted to know?
</P>
<P>
   I explained to him that the American Legion is pushing the
flag-desecration amendment to the U.S. Constitution in a big way.
The courts have been pretty clear that burning a flag is protected
activity. It's free speech under the meaning of the First
Amendment. But, according to the polls, four in five Americans want
flag desecration treated differently, so Congress probably will go
along.
</P>
<P>
   You can expect this thing to pass and to go out to the state
legislatures for ratification. Rep. John Sweeney, R-N.Y., is one of
the sponsors of this thing. The amendment reads, ``The Congress
shall have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the
flag of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   I pointed out to Sweeney's people that the amendment's wording
does nothing to clear up questions like the ones Joe had asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, they agreed, it doesn't. All this does is give Congress
the power to pass a law to punish flag desecrators. How that law
would read and how the flag would be defined hasn't been dealt with
yet, much less how the courts would respond to that language and to
the enforcement of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if 80 percent of Americans want to exempt the flag from
free speech considerations _ and if that majority holds up long
enough for the amendment to go through the whole, lengthy, arduous
process _ then fine. So the flag will get special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But I served under that flag, too, and this does strike me as
much ado about nothing in particular. It's pandering to people who
worry too much about symbolism and too little about real problems
and their potential solutions.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen flags burned. When I was breaking into the news
business, flag-burning was all the rage at anti-war demonstrations.
It's a stupid, silly thing to do. It convinces nobody of the wisdom
and justice of your political position. All it does is annoy most
people.
</P>
<P>
   But, just as the world will continue spinning on its axis if
this thing passes, so, too will the world get along just fine if
some jerk burns a flag and doesn't go to jail for it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk about Kosovo, Social Security and youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   You know, stuff that's real.

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; TIMBUKTU &QL; 
 &UR; Paul Auster (Holt, $22)
</P>
<P>
   Auster's new novel is told from the point of view of Mr. Bones,
the canine companion of the dying Willy G. Christmas. Willy is a
homeless poet, a rambling man whose devotion to Mr. Bones is such
that he is determined to find a new home for the dog before he dies
(and goes to Timbuktu, which is what the next world is called; it
is, Willy has told Mr. Bones, an ``oasis of the spirit''). With
that in mind, they have traveled to Baltimore, with the secondary
purpose of finding Willy's old English teacher and entrusting to
her 74 notebooks that Willy has filled with poems, stories, diary
entries and an epic-in-progress. Mr. Bones has been with Willy
since he was a pup, and they are a poignant pair, especially if
you, the reader, are a dog lover. If not, Mr. Bones might seem
rather cloying, a persona built on wishful thinking and canine
caricature (he is devoted, smart, watchful, patient, good-natured
and deeply vulnerable to the loss of his human partner _ everything
we want our dogs to be). And so Mr. Bones' adventures after he
parts ways with Willy are fraught with our intense desire to see
him treated well, to see him not just survive but find a new home
in which he will be loved. If you have the stamina for it, this is
an interesting look at the human race through the eyes of Willy's
best friend. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; LAPHAM'S RULES OF INFLUENCE &QL; 
 &UR; Lewis Lapham (Random House, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   Here is Lewis Lapham's intellect on display; it is so impressive
that there were moments when we had no idea what he was talking
about, but we pretended we did and that would have made Lapham
proud. He has written a primer, of sorts, on fawning, on
sycophancy, on that widespread strategy identified by two words
that begin with a ``k'' and an ``a'' and end with an almost
inevitable spurt of career advancement. It is Lapham's sad but
funny premise that all of the conviction and backbone have gone out
of the career-building process, that we are a nation of fawners and
flatterers with our success tied to our skill at ``bowing and
smiling in eight or nine different directions, forever turning,
like a compass needle or a weather vane, into the wind of new
money.'' His advice to the ambitious is funny and delightfully
withering. On cliches: ``Make unsparing use of them. The empty word
is the correct word. Contrary to the opinion of snobbish New York
intellectuals, the placid murmur of cliche is always preferable to
sharp insight or strong feeling. Think of waterfalls in the lobbies
of Hyatt hotels. Practice the sound by reading aloud the essays of
Roger Rosenblatt or the editorial page of the Washington Post.'' On
curiosity: ``Too much is a mark of inferior rank. You will be
mistaken for a tourist or a waiter.'' On meetings: ``A good meeting
is one at which nothing happens. . . . Sit erect, second all the
motions, remember everybody's name.'' On lies: ``Always more
welcome than the truth. The word is ugly, but the service never
fails to please.'' Lapham is editor of ``Harper's Magazine,'' and
we think he's witty, handsome and beyond brilliant, oh yes, we
truly do. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BUSINESS DAD &QL; 
 &UR; Tom Hirschfeld (Little, Brown, $23)
</P>
<P>
   First, the credentials: Hirschfeld is a venture capitalist who
serves on the boards of six corporations and one non-profit
institution, and he was previously assistant to the mayor of New
York City and vice president in corporate finance at Salomon
Brothers. He also is the father of two children. So, does he write
like a businessman, or like a dad? Neither _ he sounds like a
slightly stilted man who is beginning to understand the angst that
women have felt all along as they tried to balance the demands of
family and career. This book _ its subtitle is ``How Good
Businessmen Can Make Great Fathers (and Vice Versa)'' _ is
laughable as Hirschfeld applies terms such as ``transferable
skills,'' ``human capital,'' ``customer support'' and ``power
fathering'' to the home front in an effort to establish common
ground with the office. In the end, it sounds like remedial lessons
in fathering for the corporate simpleton. We're not sure Hirschfeld
gets his message across, but it's interesting to watch him try. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; 250 WAYS TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER &QL; 
 &UR; The editors of ``George'' magazine (Villard, $12.95)
</P>
<P>
   Here's the first problem with this book: There's no index and no
table of contents, and any book that advertises such strange
bedfellows as Sen. John McCain and rapper Ice T should have both.
Furthermore, it contains words of wisdom _ suggestions on how to
make the country a better place _ from 250 Americans (or 249 _ Al
Franken suggests putting mirrored ceilings above airport luggage
carousels, a wise idea only by the standards of chiropractors and
personal injury lawyers), but the biographical information is
limited to one or two words: ``Mollie Katzen, cookbook author.''
``Esther Williams, swimwear executive.'' ``Dan Rather, reporter.''
We've reached the conclusion that ``George'' wants to emphasize the
ideas rather than the celebrities who suggest them, but if that's
the case why ask Connie Stevens (``performer'') in the first place?
Which brings us to the biggest problem here: So many of the ideas
are predictable (improve education, fight teenage pregnancies) or
even mildly embarrassing. Roy Blount Jr.'s paragraph is lazy
nonsense, and fashion designer Todd Oldham pushes vegetarianism
even as he laments his weakness for suede shoes (``I've tried to
rationalize these shoes as being a by-product of other people's
diets, etc., and I know there are cruelty-free options _ but vinyl
shoes are known to rot your toenails off!''). Other contributors
include Garry Wills, Tabitha Soren, Pete Seeger, Dr. Ruth
Westheimer, Helen Gurley Brown, Larry King and Pat Boone. &QL;

AIR FORCE RECRUITS FACE TOUGHER BOOT CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Reacting to criticism that basic training isn't
tough enough, the Air Force this fall will require its recruits at
Lackland Air Force Base to endure a seven-day test of war-fighting
skills.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind ``Warrior Week'' is to create an Air Force
``that is more ready to go to a forward-deployed location and live
in an austere environment,'' Lt. Col. Steven Ray said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Similar events have been instituted in the Army, Navy and Marine
Corps in recent years. Lackland is the Air Force's sole site for
basic training of enlisted personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably one of the biggest changes to Air Force basic
military training in over 50 years,'' said Ray, commander of the
737th Training Support Squadron at Lackland.
</P>
<P>
   The 33,000 recruits graduating from Lackland's six-week basic
training course each year spend just two days and one night in the
field. Warrior Week will change all that when it begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Recruits in their fifth week of basic training will live in
tents. They'll practice target shooting at an M-16 firing range,
complete a 5.8-mile march over hilly terrain, eat MREs (meals ready
to eat) and learn to defend air bases in potentially hostile areas.
</P>
<P>
   Successfully completing Warrior Week is a requirement for
graduation from basic training, Lackland spokeswoman Irene Witt
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warrior Week will give the airmen a chance to be in a weeklong
deployment situation, rather than the 24-hour one currently
included in BMT,'' Gen. Lloyd W. ``Fig'' Newton said in a recent
address to the 97th Air Mobility Wing at Altus Air Force Base in
Oklahoma. BMT stands for basic military training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to change the culture, so when these airmen get to
their first duty station after technical school they will already
know the deployment basics,'' added Newton, commander of the Air
Education and Training Command at Randolph Air Force Base in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Warrior Week was recommended by the Federal Advisory Committee
on Gender-Integrated Training to improve physical training
standards. Defense Secretary William Cohen declined to adopt a
recommendation made by the panel to end mixed-gender basic training
in the Air Force, Army and Navy.
</P>
<P>
   But the Air Force and other services already had moved to
toughen training even before the commission's report was issued in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines instituted ``the Crucible'' in 1996. The Navy's
variation of the concept is called ``battle stations.'' The Army
includes a four-day field exercise dubbed ``Victory Forge'' that
began two years ago at Fort Jackson, S.C., the service's largest
basic training facility.

ON WALL STREET, GAYS KEEP A LOW PROIFLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A secret society haunts Wall Street. By day, its
members lie low, taking pains to fit in with the other brokers and
bond traders, waiting until night falls, when they can gather with
their own and, finally, be themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They are the homosexuals of big finance, and, despite New York
City's reputation as a mecca for gay culture and tolerance, most of
them stay in the closet _ while on the job, anyway _ as if they
worked in a small Midwestern town in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to proclaim myself gay,'' said one officer in a
major New York bank, who asked not to be identified, ``I would
definitely be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Industrywide, Wall Street is the most homophobic place you can
work in this city,'' said a securities analyst at a major financial
company.
</P>
<P>
   This aspect of the culture seeped to the surface recently when
Christian L. Curry, a 25-year-old securities analyst, filed a
lawsuit against his former employer, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Curry is demanding an attention-grabbing $1.35 billion, charging
that Morgan Stanley's executives fired him for reasons of
discrimination, partly because he is black, partly because they
thought he was gay. He was fired days after nude photos of him
appeared in a gay pornography magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The Curry case is complicated. Morgan Stanley insists that Curry
was fired for padding his expense account and also contends that he
was caught fabricating racist e-mail on the firm's computer system
to back up his lawsuit. In a further twist, two of the firm's legal
executives were recently forced to resign for paying $10,000 to an
informant who supposedly trapped Curry in his e-mail scam.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever really happened and however the suit turns out, few
gays in the industry have trouble believing that someone on the
Street could get fired for suspicions of being gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not at all surprising,'' said Jennifer Hatch, co-owner of
Christopher Street Financial. The incidence of such firings, she
added, is ``common enough to keep people very much in the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a rough-and-tumble world, where steely nerves, hard drive,
and skyscraper stacks of money are seen as the markers of
manliness. Those whose lifestyles defy the equation often find
themselves hounded out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's company, named after the most famously gay street in
Manhattan's West Village, is the city's only all-gay financial
firm. A former ``high-heeled bond trader'' at J. P. Morgan and Bear
Stearns, Hatch bought Christopher Street from the estate of the
original owner, who died of AIDS two years ago, because she was
weary of role-playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street is a bunch of really insecure people, playing for
very, very high stakes, who don't tolerate any differences,'' she
said. ``I mean, this is a place where everybody's pinstripes are
the same width.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, 38, came to Wall Street right out of college. ``I
remember thinking it was crazy that I'd chosen this field,'' she
said. ``I thought I was the only gay person on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Through reading the gay press, she learned of the New York
Bankers Group, a social and networking organization for gays and
lesbians in the city's financial industry. Even today, the group
remains as low-key as its moniker. It is not listed in the phone
book. Its president, a bank executive, does not want his name to
appear in print.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 people belong to the group. They meet regularly at
restaurants, wine tastings, gallery openings, or at each other's
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a group like this, knowing you're not the only one,''
Hatch said, ``it makes things easier.''
</P>
<P>
   But, many would add, not a lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Daniels, 36, was all set to be named a vice president at the
North American branch of Dresdner Bank. ``My name was up on the
door; the business cards were printed up,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April 1997, he announced he was gay. Within days, he
was fired. The firm said he was let go because of ``downsizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees of securities firms are required to sign a form _
known as the U-4 agreement _ when they join, pledging to settle any
dispute with their employer through an arbitration committee, not
through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Goldberg _ head of Lambda Legal Defense, a gay
civil-liberties organization _ objects to the arbitration rule,
pointing out that lawsuits have been responsible for breaking down
racial and sexual discrimination across many realms of American
social and business life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U-4 clause,'' she said, ``is what has allowed
discrimination to continue to flourish on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels found a way around this obstacle. He sued Dresdner's
parent company _ which is based in Germany, where securities law
contains nothing like a U-4 clause _ and asked for $77 million in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, with the agreement of all parties, the federal judge
handling the case turned it over to arbitration, ruling that
Daniels was technically not an employee of the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels's lawyer, Madeline Bryer, is hopeful of winning anyway.
While the case was still facing federal trial, she conducted a
formal discovery process, taking depositions and amassing evidence,
which are generally not allowed in arbitration cases.
</P>
<P>
   Many are watching the Daniels case as a possible
precedent-setter, as well as Curry's case against Morgan Stanley,
though with mixed feelings because of its more perplexing nature.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one expects dramatic changes overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The bank officer who said he worries about being fired if he
came out of the closet has reason for his fears. In the last Wall
Street firm where he worked, he told his boss he was gay not long
ago, in order to complain about harassment from a colleague. ``That
was on a Friday,'' he recalled. ``On Monday, I was fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street generally is ``a macho culture,'' he went on. ``Most
of the executives are married men, not from Manhattan, who want to
talk about sports, their wives, their kids. Homophobic jokes are
unbelievably commonplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch observed that some older executives _ who long ago rose to
the top, made big bucks for their firms, and stashed away enough
money for themselves _ do feel secure enough to come out or at
least to adopt a blithe indifference to what others might think.
</P>
<P>
   But for the still-rising young star, the coast is far from
clear.
</P>
<P>
   One gay securities analyst, who asked not to be identified, is
worried that some of his supervisors suspect he is gay. ``They look
at me funny at meetings,'' he said. ``I think I make them insecure,
as if they worry that I might be looking at their crotches.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's a job where you don't want to take any chances.
There's probably not another profession where you can make so much
money, so quickly. It's very competitive. People will use anything
against you. I'm always very worried about the security of my job.
Being gay is just an added weight. The paranoia goes very deep.''

BUSH, GORE START DEFINING THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ With any luck, the presidential campaign should
now be able to proceed without the burden of two ridiculous
propositions that have been disseminated by the political
establishment:
</P>
<P>
   1. Texas Governor George Bush has no views.
</P>
<P>
   2. Vice President Al Gore doesn't exist except as an extension
of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   You'd never know it from the silly press coverage of Bush's
first foray out of Austin, but in fact, the governor gave a
self-portrayal in stump speech form that vividly put him on the
Republican map and co-opted rivals in important areas.
</P>
<P>
   And in Gore's case, the endless scouting reports about a
dull-witted Clinton clone are about to clash with the reality as
his own campaign formally begins this week. His campaign is making
much more about the personal and family Gore. And in an interview,
the vice president spoke as someone ``with different priorities,
different approaches, different interests'' _ epitomized by the
zeal he brings to the subject of education, especially for very
young children.
</P>
<P>
   But first, president-in-waiting Bush. In an interesting
decision, he chose his first remarks to declare his support for
cuts in marginal income tax rates and for the diversion of a
portion of federal payroll taxes away from the Social Security
trust fund to support new individualized retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential politics aside, this is a remarkable development.
It matters not at all that Bush isn't ready yet to say which of the
rates he'd cut by how much. The real point is that he made the
basic commitment, which is far more consequential than his awkward
venture last week into special-interest land in vowing to veto
income tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   The reason it's consequential involves both the economy and
Bush's self-identification as a ``compassionate conservative.'' As
Bob Dole discovered in 1996, tax cut proposals that are not
specifically balanced by spending cuts come off in this era as both
irresponsible and lacking credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's proposal of a 15 percent reduction across the board not
only went nowhere for those reasons; in the end it probably
backfired. One reason is that the hole left in the budget _ worth
hundreds of billions of dollars over a decade _ could not be filled
with anything less than an evisceration of federal domestic
programs. And by not being willing to fill it, Dole was vulnerable
to the charge that he was risking the economy's prosperity with a
new round of federal debt and, therefore, interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   The problem would only be compounded by any diversion of
existing Social Security revenue into retirement accounts. The
initial outlay to fund such a diversion (the standard proposal is 2
percentage points of the payroll tax) would be gigantic. And, in
the end, the resulting program would not be Social Security as we
know it.
</P>
<P>
   In a general election, the economy is just about everything.
When told of Bush's remarks, Gore's eyebrows arched. While avoiding
direct comment on words he hadn't seen, he sounded just as he did
in '96 debating Dole's running mate, Jack Kemp, in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Risky tax schemes will drive our economy right back into debt
all over again and threaten our prosperity,'' he said. And on
Social Security, Gore said, ``The key is to preserve the budget
surplus until we are certain Social Security has been saved. And
protecting it, and Medicare also, does not require threatening the
standard of living of the elderly. Above all, the first thing it
requires is that we keep the prosperity going.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bush's move is likely to help him in the Republican
contest, getting a jump on Elizabeth Dole and partially co-opting
Steve Forbes, Dan Quayle, and Lamar Alexander, who have been more
specific and more radical.
</P>
<P>
   His downright confrontational attitude toward the party's right
wing was also significant. Bush was most explicit in denouncing
protectionism and advocating ``free trade'' (take that, Pat
Buchanan and Gary Bauer). But it should have been noted that in his
maiden voyage he had nothing at all to say about stopping abortion,
promoting school vouchers, restricting immigration, denouncing gun
control, or attacking the supposedly immoral popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing for the country that could come from a Bush
nomination, won convincingly and early, would be his and the
party's liberation from the right's vice-grip. Let's see if he
stays independent.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the candidate I heard over the weekend who was
most upset about a status quo was Gore. He spoke about ``a crisis
confronting the American family'' involving work, health care, and
education, creating what he called a ``serious care deficit.'' He
doesn't belabor the point about his total identification with the
president's record and his deep involvement in it. Instead, turning
to the future, he shows much greater zeal about a new set of
issues.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to assume that either of these guys will be
nominees 14 months hence. But it's not too early to argue that the
standard descriptions of Bush and Gore are mostly wrong and that
theirs would be a serious, consequential campaign.

`STAR WARS' CREATOR PLANS HIGH-TECH CAMPUS AT OLD ARMY BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYCHE HENDRICKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Star Wars'' director George Lucas has won
approval to transform 23 acres inside the Presidio into a grassy
campus for more than 2,000 technical wizards of the Lucasfilm
empire.
</P>
<P>
   The Presidio Trust announced Monday that after a rigorous
eight-month selection process, the Lucas plan for the new Presidio
National Park had trumped a competing development proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The trust's presidentially appointed board of directors said it
would begin exclusive negotiations with Letterman Digital Arts Ltd.
to develop more than 800,000 square feet of office space for
several Lucas enterprises, along with the nonprofit George Lucas
Educational Foundation and new Visual Effects Archive.
</P>
<P>
   The old Letterman Army Hospital would be razed to make way for
the project, which also is to include 15 acres of park-like public
open space.
</P>
<P>
   The Presidio, an active military garrison for more than 200
years before it was turned over to the National Park Service in
1994, covers some 1,400 acres in the northwestern corner of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Radley, the president of Lucasfilm, said he believed the
project would ``allow the Presidio to become known not just for the
beauty of its setting and its historical location, but for the
ideas that come from this place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity for Northern California to solidify
its position in the world as a global center for the digital age,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucas project beat out a rival proposal pitched by
Shorenstein Co. of San Francisco and Interland of San Mateo for a
residential development and office park.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown had endorsed the Shorenstein proposal last
month. On Monday, the mayor offered cautious congratulations to
Lucas on ``the opportunity to continue with the exclusive
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The development at the Letterman site is expected to be the cash
cow of the effort to make the former Army base self-sufficient by
2013. If negotiations proceed smoothly, Lucasfilm will sign a land
lease with the Presidio Trust in October and agree to pay at least
$5 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the single largest contribution to the $36 million
that must be generated yearly by 2013 to cover operating costs of
the national park. The remaining $31 million will come from office
and residential leases elsewhere in the Presidio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Letterman Digital Arts Center would feature a global
institute of digital learning and a library of digital arts open to
scholars. It would include a 7-acre great lawn with cafes and a
lagoon near the Presidio's Lombard Gate. More than two-thirds of
the total 23 acres will be open space for public use. All 1,500
parking spaces at the site would be underground.
</P>
<P>
   The campus is to house five Lucas companies _ Industrial Light
and Magic, Lucas Arts Entertainment Co., Lucas Learning Ltd., THX
Group, and Lucas Online _ which currently are dispersed in offices
around Marin County. Those companies now employ about 1,600 people,
said Radley, but that could eventually increase to 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucasfilm headquarters will remain at Skywalker Ranch in
Marin's bucolic Lucas Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In August, 18 developers responded to an initial query about
interest in developing the 23-acre Letterman site.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 5, the Trust announced the selection of four
semifinalists to present detailed proposals for the site:
Lucasfilm; Shorenstein/Interland; Walsh Higgins and Co. of Chicago,
which proposed construction of a Marriott Hotel and senior living
center; and LNR Presidio Partners, which proposed a mixed-use
project that included the Goldman Institute on Aging and a Joie de
Vivre Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The list was narrowed to the two finalists on May 3, although
Presidio Trust Executive Director James Meadows said that should
lease negotiations with the winner fail, the trust could begin
negotiations with any of the semifinalists.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows said Monday that both the Lucas and Shorenstein
proposals were strong, but that the board decided in favor of a
single user rather than a collection of different tenants, and was
swayed by the influence Lucasfilm has had on special-effects
filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've totally changed the film industry over the last 10
years almost single-handedly,'' he said. ``The deciding factors
were that we felt the educational outreach, the scientific research
and the cutting-edge technology most closely fit our goals for the
future of the Presidio.''

PUTNAM STRUGGLES TO ADAPT TO CHANGING FINANCIAL WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON -- Putnam Investments strode into the mutual fund arena
this decade with surefooted investment performance and a knockout
sales strategy that made its hometown rival, Fidelity Investments,
take notice. But lately, the old-line firm has taken a few blows.
</P>
<P>
   After years of blistering growth, nearly as much money is
flowing out of Putnam's funds as is coming in. The firm's
fixed-income unit, once among the nation's hottest, is struggling
to regain its footing after sinking returns, client defections, and
a jarring reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   And Putnam, which sells its funds via brokers, financial
planners, and banks, rather than directly to investors, stands amid
a changing world in which the traditional middleman is threatened
by do-it-yourself investing and on-line stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   The shifts could mean ``a changing of the guard'' for fund firms
that sell through intermediaries, as Putnam is challenged by
fast-rising competitors after years of leading the pack, wrote
Financial Research Corp., a research firm, in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Putnam still has good funds, and its gross sales are
the best in the ``wholesale,'' or intermediary, business. Last
quarter, the firm said, investors put $12.3 billion into Putnam
funds _ a rise of 15 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   But industry observers say investors also pulled large sums out
of Putnam funds. According to Financial Research, the company's net
sales, or new cash minus money withdrawn, fell to $1.7 billion from
$5.2 billion a year earlier. Putnam, whose owner is insurance
broker Marsh &AMP; McLennan Cos., declined to state redemption levels.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Lucey, Putnam's head of sales and marketing,
downplayed the outflows. Redemptions were up across the industry,
he said, and Putnam, which oversees a hefty $238 billion in assets,
was merely being penalized for managing so much money. Higher
redemption rates hurt large fund firms more.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest I think a lot of people are playing games with
their money,'' Lucey said, adding that customers were withdrawing
money to buy individual stocks or finance houses and vacations.
``The market is conducive to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam investors are generally viewed as an older, more affluent
group that likes the company's conservative ``truth-in-labeling''
philosophy, in which a fund won't change its focus to follow the
market. Under its hard-driving chief executive, Lawrence Lasser,
Putnam concentrates more on value stocks, or bargain-priced shares,
than on growth stocks, the steady-earning blue chips that have
produced the bulk of Wall Street's gains in recent years. It
generally does not take big bets on individual sectors or issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a stock market full of young day traders, high-flying
Internet stocks, and portfolio managers making outsize bets on a
handful of blue chips, the firm seems downright unfashionable.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's $38.8 billion Growth &AMP; Income fund, which saw investors
pull out $700 million last quarter, according to Financial
Research, has gained 7.8 percent so far this year, beating a 5.3
percent rise in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, a broad market
measure. While that is nothing to sniff at, the fund ranks as a
middle-of-the-pack offering compared with other growth and income
funds, said Jeffrey McConnell, an equity analyst at Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   The $26.9 billion Voyager fund saw investors pull out $400
million last quarter _ even though the fund's returns have recently
improved. Voyager has gained 7.7 percent so far this year, a half
percentage point less than its peer average.
</P>
<P>
   Even amid strong sales, the steep withdrawals exact a toll by
spooking investors, distracting managers, reducing overall profits,
and undercutting Putnam's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's bond department has more substantial woes. Dismal
returns and the loss of key accounts from major retirement plans
led the company to overhaul the unit a year ago, firing nearly a
dozen portfolio managers, streamlining command chains, intensifying
its team approach, and giving Tim Ferguson, who oversees equity
investments, control over the bond group as well. The changes have
yet to bear much fruit; while returns at some bond funds have
improved, Putnam's corporate bond funds are some of the worst
performers around.
</P>
<P>
   With all the bumps and bruises, one would think the
intermediaries who distribute Putnam funds would be irritated. But
Putnam's third-party channels are famously loyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidence that their problems will pass,'' said
Thomas Miltenberger, who oversees marketing at Edward Jones, a
Missouri brokerage that is a major seller of Putnam products.
Putnam sells one-third of its funds through brokerages, 28 percent
via financial planners, and the rest through banks.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry observers, however, wonder if Putnam, founded in
1937, can survive a changing investment culture. At many firms,
brokers are being transformed from salesmen who are paid for each
transaction to financial advisers who are compensated according to
how much money they manage. Some brokers find themselves bypassed
altogether, as their customers purchase securities on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, Putnam is having the same problem that Merrill
Lynch is having,'' said fund industry consultant Geoff Bobroff.
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the nation's largest stock brokerage, recently
decided to let customers buy and sell investment products directly
and cheaply on line _ a sea change for the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shifts, Putnam has no intention of abandoning its
network of wholesalers and brokers, Lucey said. Indeed, the company
notes that sales of funds to investors through financial planners
have grown in recent years, as newly wealthy investors seek advice
_ and pay for it by giving advisers a percentage of assets under
management, rather than commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam representatives, or wholesalers, develop relationships
with ``third-party'' sellers like Edward Jones, whom Putnam in turn
pays commissions and asset-based fees for selling Putnam products
to ordinary investors.
</P>
<P>
   The company is working to strengthen its relationships with its
third-party sellers. It is pilot-testing a controversial new
strategy in which Putnam's biggest sellers, like Edward Jones, are
rewarded with extra layers of Putnam service.
</P>
<P>
   And with smaller companies like MFS Investment Services now
outselling Putnam, the firm is also adding more ``wholesaling''
staff.
</P>
<P>
   But in the future, observers say, Putnam may have to think about
changing its fees for wholesalers, who are still paid according to
how much they sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putnam's investment formula generally works and they have
great service,'' said Louis Harvey, president of Dalbar Inc., a
consulting firm. ``But ultimately, the traditional wholesale model
is dying. And they are absolutely aware of this.''

THEY'RE THE SPURS OF THE MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ We've been so immersed in the improbable story of
the Knicks over these past few weeks that we've had little time to
recognize and salute the team that emerged from the Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   This is a first for the San Antonio Spurs; they're in virgin
territory. They also are the first team from the defunct American
Basketball Association to appear in the NBA Finals. They have not
played since June 6, when they finished off a sweep of the Portland
Trail Blazers in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is an interesting history. They started in Dallas as the
Chaparrals, toiling there for six years (spending one of those
years as the Texas Chaparrals) before moving south to San Antonio
in 1973. They've had such luminaries as Doug Moe, Larry Brown, John
Lucas, Cotton Fitzsimmons, and Jerry Tarkanian as head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   They are the only team to play all of their home games in a
dome, the Alamodome, which opened in 1993 with the expectation that
a football team would soon arrive. It hasn't come, and the Spurs
are now in search of a new home. A ballot initiative will be held
later this year (or possibly in January) for a new arena. If it
fails, the Spurs may have no choice but to leave town.
</P>
<P>
   What else do they have going into Wednesday night's Game 1?
Well, here are some instructive things to know about San Antonio in
its first venture into prime time:
</P>
<P>
   A RING FOR ONE OF JOHN'S GUYS: This championship series will
produce a first: a championship ring for a Georgetown player
coached by John Thompson. We're all familiar with Patrick Ewing's
quixotic quest, but the first Thompson-bred Hoya to claim a title
may well be the Spurs' Jaren Jackson. You would think that
somewhere along the way a much-traveled player such as Reggie
Williams or David Wingate would have gotten a ring. (Actually,
Wingate will get one if the Knicks win; he's on the playoff roster,
although he's injured.) But no. The closest? After Ewing (who lost
in the 1994 Finals), there's Sleepy Floyd, who left the Rockets the
year before they won the first of their two, and Othella
Harrington, who joined them two years after they won the last of
their two.
</P>
<P>
   THE GUARDS: Has there ever been such a motley assemblage of
guards representing a team in the NBA Finals as this Gang of Four?
They have played for a combined 23 NBA teams, five CBA teams, two
from the World Basketball League, one from the United States
Basketball League, as well as teams in Portugal, Argentina, and
Ireland. Two of the four, Jackson and Avery Johnson, weren't
drafted. Starter Mario Elie was a seventh-round pick, and Steve
Kerr, who rarely plays, was a second-rounder. Johnson was cut twice
by the Spurs and also owns the distinction of being cut by the
Nuggets on Christmas Eve in 1990. Jackson has been in the NBA for
parts of nine seasons, the first eight with eight teams.
</P>
<P>
   SEAN ELLIOTT: Back in 1994, when the Rockets were in the NBA
Finals, Robert Horry was asked repeatedly about having been traded
earlier that year, only to have the trade nullified. The guy he was
traded for? Sean Elliott. Elliott, then with Detroit, failed the
physical and the deal was called off. Horry helped the Rockets to
two world titles. Elliott, meanwhile, started his career in San
Antonio (he came the same year as David Robinson) and was traded to
Detroit for Dennis Rodman. He lasted one year there and was sent
back to the Spurs for Billy Curley and a second-rounder. Guess who
made out the best in that trade?
</P>
<P>
   THE BOSTON CONNECTION: There's a slight Boston connection here,
starting with the depressing sight of Tim Duncan, whom M.L. Carr
tried so hard to get, only to see the balls bounce another way. The
Spurs were once coached by Cliff Hagan, whose rights the Celtics
traded to St. Louis for the draft pick that went for Bill Russell.
The Spurs' third-round pick in 1978 was a swift guard from Virginia
Commonwealth named Gerald Henderson. He was the last player cut in
training camp. If he had stuck around, who would have stole James
Worthy's pass in Game 2 of the 1984 Finals? The Spurs have drafted
Dwayne Schintzius, who we think is still on the Celtics, as well as
Boston College's Curley and a fellow named Glen Fine from Harvard
in the 10th round of the 1979 draft. When the Spurs were in the
ABA, among the players they drafted were Jo Jo White, Robert
Parish, Tiny Archibald, Curtis Rowe, and Bill Walton.
</P>
<P>
   THE CHAMPIONSHIP CONNECTION: For a team that has never been here
before, the Spurs have a fair amount of guys who have. They have
two players who can relate Michael Jordan stories until the cows
come home. Kerr, of course, was a member of the Bulls' last three
title teams. Will Perdue was a member of their first three before
being traded to San Antonio for Rodman. Elie won two rings while
playing a big bench role for the Rockets, and Jerome Kersey was a
member of Portland teams that reached the Finals in 1990 and 1992.
Jackson won two championships in the CBA with Wichita Falls and La
Crosse.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S HARD TO MESS UP THE TOP PICK: San Antonio has had the top
pick in the draft twice: the year Robinson was available and the
year Duncan was available. Duh. They are the only players on the
roster who are soup-to-nuts Spurs (and that's a short
entree/dessert in Duncan's case), while Elliott is the only other
player drafted by San Antonio. He went No. 3 in 1989 but, as we've
seen, is one who went away but came back.

LEBANESE ALLIED WITH ISRAEL FACE NEW FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   METULLA, Israel _ As far back as he can remember, Simon Abu
Umrah has lived in rhythm with Israel, which for nearly two decades
has been both his occupier and protector in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Six days a week the 38-year-old resident of the Lebanese town of
Marjayoun gets up before dawn to cross the border in time for his
job as a janitor in Metulla. In the summers, his children receive
passes to come over and splash in a pool that is just a 15-minute
drive away. When someone in his family needs special medical care,
they ask for a permit to visit a hospital in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, his family has been a staunch backer of the Israeli
Army, which has occupied south Lebanon since 1985. Three of his
brothers are soldiers in the Israeli-financed militia that battles
Hezbollah guerrillas and two cousins died fighting for the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Israel better than I know Lebanon; nobody in my family
has even been to Beirut in years,'' said Abu Umrah.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes at night I can't sleep, because I am worried
about the future, about what will happen to us when Israel leaves
Lebanon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Israelis clamor for Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak to
make good on his promise to get Israeli troops out of south Lebanon
within a year, Lebanese who cast their lot with the Jewish state
are wondering what will happen when the soldiers leave, the border
is closed, and they are left alone.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 Lebanese, mostly relatives of soldiers in
Israel's local militia, have the coveted white slip of paper that
allows them to work in Israel, while about 2,500 are soldiers in
what is called the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   There are few job opportunities in south Lebanon, ravaged by
years of war, forcing many people to turn to Israel whether they
want to or not. South Lebanon Army soldiers are paid $500 a month
and workers in Israel can earn about $700 a month, a healthy sum of
money in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lebanese government, which is officially at war with
Israel, views South Lebanon Army soldiers as traitors. People
working in Israel worry that they may not be seen as much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all afraid,'' said Janice, 31, who cleans house in
Metulla for $27 a day. Like all Lebanese workers in Israel, she
must pay 10 percent of her salary to the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Israel leaves Lebanon there could be a big problem for
those of us working here; they will kill us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``they'' she referred to is Hezbollah guerrillas, the
Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim militia trying to oust Israeli forces
from its 9-mile-wide occupation zone in south Lebanon, where about
90,000 people live. Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its
northern border from attack.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of Marjayoun interviewed in Metulla said they
fear that if Israel pulls out its troops and the Lebanese Army does
not take over the area, Hezbollah guerrillas will move in and exact
revenge on the largely Christian-led South Lebanon Army force and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure is mounting inside Israel for an end to what
critics call the country's Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Since Israeli troops carved out their security zone, 247
soldiers have died, in addition to the 655 killed during Israel's
invasion of Lebanon from 1982 to 1985, when troops went as far as
Beirut. About 500 South Lebanon Army soldiers have been killed
since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis say a unilateral withdrawal is better than no
withdrawal. But without a peace deal with Lebanon _ and its patron
Syria _ Hezbollah guerrillas could move closer to Israel's northern
border and keep up attacks. For Syria, Hezbollah has been a good
way to pressure Israel for return of the Syrian Golan Heights,
occupied by Israel in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are signs that the South Lebanon Army is also
tiring of the fight in south Lebanon, and that Hezbollah is gaining
ground. Earlier this month, South Lebanon Army forces suddenly quit
the Jezzine enclave they had occupied for 14 years just north of
Israel's security zone.
</P>
<P>
   In a possible sign of what Israel could expect if it pulls out
without a deal, the Lebanese government has refused to deploy its
army to the enclave, a move that would have hampered Hezbollah
guerrillas. Beirut has also indicated there would not be any
outright amnesty for South Lebanon Army soldiers who stayed behind
to surrender rather than withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me and my friends, now we have nothing,'' said a South
Lebanon Army officer who spirited his wife and children out of
Jezzine as the withdrawal took place. The family was hiding in a
cheap hotel in Metulla while they waited for expected help from
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But some Lebanese may be prepared to reintegrate after an
Israeli withdrawal. Some members of the South Lebanon Army are said
to be playing both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone tells you they love Israel, it's not true; they love
the money,'' said a 34-year-old Lebanese woman working in Metulla.

FEE CHANGES BY FIDELITY RAISE QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kurt Kuberek was a typical customer when he bought into
Fidelity's Destiny funds nine years ago, a military man prepared to
invest for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   The two Destiny funds, an original and a clone, were known for
their onerous upfront sales charges and an arcane contract-style
investment plan that committed shareholders to modest monthly
payments for 15 years or longer.
</P>
<P>
   But they also had George Vanderheiden, one of Fidelity's premier
money managers, directing the investments in both funds and a
performance-based fee arrangement that aligned the company's
interests with those of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to the present: Vanderheiden has struggled with a
conservative investment style in a hot stock market. Both Destiny
funds and their combined $12.9 billion have failed to match their
bogey, the S&AMP;P 500 index, for the last four years running.
Vanderheiden, who took an extended leave to recharge himself last
year, gave up management of the Destiny II fund.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fidelity is asking shareholders to vote down the arrangement
that bases its fees on performance and replace it with a flat
charge. If that change had been in effect last year, Fidelity
reports it would have earned $8.6 million more on Destiny I alone.
</P>
<P>
   Proxies will be counted this week at a fund meeting in Boston.
If it runs true to form for mutual fund meetings, virtually no one
will attend and the proposal will win easy approval. That doesn't
mean everyone is satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (sales) loads and fees are high by anyone's standards,''
said Kuberek, who has since left the Air Force but continues to
contribute $166.66 per month to his Destiny II account. ``To try to
get more kind of stepped across the line as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Destiny proposal has more significance than the shuffling of
a few numbers to the right of a decimal point and none of the
implications are especially flattering.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has been a performance-based fee leader in a business
that makes a staggering amount of money, typically at a rate
without regard to how well managers actually perform. Our question:
Is this the beginning of a larger shift at Fidelity?
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the company say Fidelity first conducted
preliminary market research into the potential reaction of dumping
performance-based fees as far back as 1994, when many of its funds
struggled badly.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity executives point out they run more than three dozen
funds that are compensated based on performance, including giants
like Magellan and Contrafund. By their account, Fidelity runs more
money on a performance-fee basis than the rest of the mutual fund
business combined. Some relatively new Fidelity funds like
Contrafund II and Small Cap Stock were created with fees that
depend on performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a strong proponent of performance fees,'' said David
Jones, a vice president of FMR Co. ``This doesn't represent any
back-away from performance fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity said the Destiny proposal was prompted by marketing
complications. A new class of Destiny fund shares, offered for the
first time last month, change the mix of upfront sales charges and
imbedded annual marketing fees that make a consistent calculation
of investment performance difficult.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, a change in the fee arrangement at Destiny is a
case of galling bad timing.
</P>
<P>
   The Destiny funds have struggled mostly because Vanderheiden
maintained a relatively conservative portfolio as the stock market
soared in recent years. His stock picks were fine, but the results
were hampered by a big investment in long-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Destiny II was turned over to manager Beth Terrana, who has been
outrunning Vanderheiden since then. The basic difference: She
hasn't held herself back with defensive investments. But Destiny II
hasn't been able to keep up with the market, either.
</P>
<P>
   Destiny I hasn't been a disaster _ more like a disappointment.
It fell behind the S&AMP;P 500 by no more than 4.4 percent (1996) and
once by as little as 0.58 percent (1995). But with a sales charge
that can run more than 8 percent, nobody wants to hear about
disappointments and they certainly shouldn't have to read about
disappearing performance fees.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Vanderheiden is ``tilting'' the fund toward value
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've used this approach many times during the 19 years that
I've been running the fund,'' Vanderheiden said in Destiny I's most
recent report to shareholders. ``In this case, however, perhaps my
prediction was a bit early. . . . But I still think that value is
the most attractive part of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his struggle in recent years, few people would recommend
betting against Vanderheiden. But Fidelity would be better off if
it took the same kind of performance risks as the customers it has
already charged so dearly.

SUMMER OF FUN IN THE APPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was in early March when we departed Pennsylvania Station and
grabbed a cab to our hotel to avoid the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Rain? It wasn't raining _ it was snowing. And we didn't realize
it until we started to gaze at St. Patrick's Cathedral well below
our 45th floor room at the New York Palace. Suddenly, we realized
those were snowflakes in front of us, but that they turned to rain
at street level. New York is full of wondrous sights, and those at
street level can be quite different 45 stories above.
</P>
<P>
   In any season, in any weather, New York City can be fun, but
summer is special.
</P>
<P>
   Dining and shopping are two of the more popular things to do, so
check out Restaurant Week June 21-25 when 100 of the top
restaurants in the city offer three-course, prix-fixe meals at
$19.99. If you're in the city Friday (June 18), join in a tasting
of the city's best foods. Restaurants will have tasting portions of
their signature dishes outside their doors, selling for $3 to $5
during lunchtime. From July 1 to Aug. 31, stores on Madison Avenue
and in SoHo are offering special values, especially to those paying
with an American Express card.
</P>
<P>
   From July 1-Sept. 30, more than 50 of the city's museums, art
centers, zoos, and historic sites will be offering one-hour tours
highlighting their best offerings. Music also will be popular this
summer with free performances by the Metropolitan Opera throughout
the five boroughs. The JVC Jazz Festival runs June 14 through June
27, and other concerts are planned. Almost every week there will be
street fairs in various neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In the museum world, art exhibits range from Cezanne to Van
Gogh, and June 12 the American Museum of Natural History opened the
Gottesman Hall of Plant Earth, which includes frozen ice-core
samples from Greenland, towering sulfide chimneys from the ocean
floor, and life-size casts of rock outcrops from Switzerland.
Everything in the hall is designed to explain our planet's inner
workings.
</P>
<P>
   For information on planning a visit to NYC, call 800-NYC-VISIT
or stop by the new Visitor Information Center at 810 Seventh Ave.
at 53rd Street or log on to www.nycvisit.com or www.
newyork.citysearch.com. With more than 62,000 rooms, there should
be no problem finding accommodations, but the city is very
accommodating and offers assistance with a one-stop hotel rate and
availability line: 800-846-7666.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's hotels all offer special packages, and great
experiences. The New York Palace (800-NY-PALACE) features a weekend
shopping getaway that includes a discount at neighboring Saks Fifth
Avenue along with personal shopping assistance and complimentary
gift wrap. The package begins at $245 a room. The hotel also
features a ``hotel within a hotel'' called The Towers with
luxurious features, including room service from Le Cirque 2000
restaurant (including its legendary creme brulee), which is located
in the Villard House, part of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a touch of the Irish? The Fitzpatrick Grand Central
Hotel at East 44th Street and Lexington Avenue, and the Fitzpatrick
Manhattan Hotel at Lexington and 56th streets, offers Irish
amenities in every room. The Manhattan has 52 suites with separate
living area that have sofa beds for the kids. Rates begin at $199
at the hotels (call 800-367-7701).
</P>
<P>
   The Times Square area's newest luxury hotel is The Premier with
features such as oversized baths, full- length windows, luxurious
beds, and Premier signature champagne Popsicles, alone worth a
visit. The hotel is adjacent to the Millennium Broadway hotel and
the Hudson Theater. Weekend rates are $279 through June 30. Call
212-789-7778.
</P>
<P>
   The Benjamin, 125 East 50th St. on the corner of Lexington
Avenue offers an intimate, boutique-style setting, and the promise
of a better night's sleep than at home. Benjamin guests can choose
from its 11 Sound Sleep Pillow Menu for just the right one to place
your head on. For information, call 888-4-BENJAMIN.
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Inn Wall Street is the first new hotel in the area
in eight years. The hotel is filled with the latest technology.
Weekend rates begin at $150. Call 212-232-7800.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe you're looking for some history. The Roosevelt Hotel,
circa 1924, is celebrating its 75th anniversary with rates
beginning at $175 through Sept. 6. The hotel has been throughly
restored while retaining all the glamour of its past. This is where
Guy Lombardo began welcoming in New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Two turn-of-the-century hotels that have been refurbished but
offer a taste of old New York are the Herald Square Hotel
(212-279-4017) and the Wolcott Hotel (212-268-2900), both on 31st
Street between Broadway and Fifth Avenue. The hotels offer rates of
about $130 for two.
</P>
<P>
   For a ``Suite Family Value,'' consider Manhattan East Suite
Hotels, nine distinct all-suite properties with rates beginning at
$220 a night through July 31. The package offers separate rooms for
parents and kids, a free guide, and more. Suites offer kitchens
with microwavee. Call 800-ME-SUITE.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in New York State
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondack Museum in Blue Mountain Lake is featuring
``Rockwell Kent's Adirondack Legacy,'' with rarely exhibited
paintings, drawings, and books. Kent, an outspoken proponent of
leftist causes, became the subject of Senator Joseph McCarthy's
Committee on Un-American Activities, and as a result his work was
shunned in the United States in the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga Springs, best known for its thoroughbred racing, which
this year runs July 28 through Labor Day (the biggest race, the
Travers Stakes, is Aug. 28), is also a place famed for its healing
waters, history, and honors: Among recent awards are the American
Heritage's first Great American Place, and the National Trust for
Historic Preservation's designation as a Great American Main
Street. For information, call 800-526-8970.

Travel Trivia: For what is New York City's 47th Street best known?
(Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: Times Square was originally called Longacre Square.
</P>
<P>
   Quotable: ``He adored New York. . . . He romanticized it all out
of proportion. To him . . . this was still a town that existed in
black and white and pulsated to the great tunes of Gershwin.'' _
Woody Allen in ``Manhattan.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
You're the star: The NBC Experience is a new, interactive,
high-tech attraction at NBC headquarters, 30 Rockefeller Plaza.
Through blue-screen technology (and for a price), you can be
interviewed by Jay Leno, ride Conan O'Brien's desk, or forecast the
weather with Al Roker of ``Today'' _ then take home a tape of these
or other encounters. In addition, you'll find a high-definiton TV
theater, a memorabilia museum, a sweet shop, and lots of
merchandise for sale. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Big mouth: The Statue of Liberty's mouth is three feet wide. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bubbly treat: Champagne Popsicles are served in the lounge of the
Premier Hotel in Times Square. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mailbag: We mentioned a report that the Boston University Bridge is
the only one where a boat can sail under a train driving under a
car driving under an airplane. But James L. Woodward of Somerville
writes: ``I can think of two places each in New York and Chicago,
and one place each in London and New Zealand that fit the bill.
Closer to home, bridges over the Kennebec at Bath, Maine, and over
the Piscataqua at Portsmouth/Kittery also are exact matches for
your description. . . . Even if you require that the highway and
railroad bridges must be separate, which they are at BU . . . I
would be very surprised if the situation is unique.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? New York City's 47th Street is best known for its
diamond and jewelry district. The block contains about 2,500
jewelry-related businesses. &QL;

REVOLUTION PLUGGING AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Zenga has spent the last few months trying to
hermetically seal the Revolution defense. But leaks have been
springing up all over the field lately.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have surrendered three goals in three of their
last four games, including an exhibition, and only an 89th-minute
equalizer by Edwin Gorter allowed them to survive against the Miami
Fusion Sunday. They will likely need to recover their
earlier-season form to maintain their third-place Eastern
Conference standing when they visit Columbus Wednesday and Tampa
Bay Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were awful at the back,'' central defender Dan Calichman
said. ``I'm glad we came back and we showed great fight. But we've
got to step it up in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fusion presented a dynamic attack, with Colombian Diego
Serna and Brazilian Welton. Midfielder Henry Gutierrez provided
excellent opportunities for them, but Zenga made two spectacular
stops of Serna to keep the Revolution in contention.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution had held Miami to one goal, and Serna had been
scoreless in two previous matches. But they seemed vulnerable to
the Fusion's combination of skill and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are dangerous,'' Calichman said, ``only when we play bad
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Revolution's problems stemmed from injuries and
lineup changes. Mike Burns (hamstring) was playing only his second
complete game since April 24. Richard Goulooze (calf) had not
played a full match since April 24, then likely overextended
himself by playing 90 minutes of a 3-0 exhibition loss to CD Santa
Clara last Thursday. Ted Chronopoulos, the left back starter in 11
games, missed the match to join the US national team. And even
Zenga (strained groin) was off form, miskicking a clearance, which
led to Serna's go-ahead goal in the 87th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 20 minutes we were tired, but we showed spirit,''
Goulooze said. ``We gave away a couple of goals, but we kept the
faith and I don't think anybody gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   Chronopoulos will return for the Columbus visit. And the left
side will be reinforced by the signing of Chaka Daley, who
performed for the Revolution in exhibitions against the Boston
Bulldogs and Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, a Toronto native who qualifies as a US citizen, can also
play central defense. He moved to Fort Lauderdale at age 16 and
played at Providence College and with the Rhode Island Stingrays,
Worcester Wildfire, and Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution waived Manny Motajo, who had played in two games,
none since May 1 . . . John Harkes (left ankle and Achilles' tendon
strain) is probable for Columbus.

HOW TO AVOID A CASE OF TENNIS ELBOW IN YOUR CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you
stronger, a philosopher once said. If you don't understand why, you
should have watched the French Open tennis tournament. It offered
more career advice and inspiration than a dozen seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Such as:
</P>
<P>
   _ The game gets harder as you get older.
</P>
<P>
   The singles champions in Paris, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf,
are both 29 years old, which is as rare these days as a Silicon
Valley company hiring two 55-year-old computer programmers. We're
in an era in which youth is served _ and age is smashed back in
your face.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Medvedev clobbered Agassi in the first two sets. In his
youth, Agassi was infamous for crumbling in situations like that;
he would have had to last five sets to win, and the stamina just
wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1999 Andre Agassi could compensate. He knew his body
wasn't as fresh as it used to be, so he trained harder. When he
lost the first two sets, he changed tactics, rushing the net more
and forcing Medvedev to hit the ball past him.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi played smart tennis. That is a sentence that couldn't
have been written 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Workers run into the same challenges. Studies have shown that
academic intelligence fades somewhat as we get older, but you can
build your street smarts. Learn to write things down instead of
forgetting them. Manage your work time instead of trying to do
everything at once. Solve problems instead of turning them into
losses or tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are many paths to success.
</P>
<P>
   Venus and Serena Williams both were upset in early round singles
matches. But by the time the French Open was over, they were
champions. They won the women's doubles title.
</P>
<P>
   Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes won in men's doubles, and
Katarina Srebotnik and Piet Norval won in mixed doubles. If you
recognize any of those four names, you're a better tennis fan than
I.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let your ego fool you: Sometimes partners can take you to
a higher level than you could reach on your own. Bill Gates might
have been a mere millionaire without Paul Allen, and God knows what
would have become of Moe without Larry and Curly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sometimes finishing second is a victory, too.
</P>
<P>
   At age 24, Medvedev was going downhill, ranked No. 100 in the
world. He didn't win the championship, but he certainly wasn't a
loser.
</P>
<P>
   You won't get every job or promotion that you try for, even if
you think you're the best candidate. But if you learn from it, just
as Agassi realized he needed to be in better condition, you'll
increase your chances the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   Figure out why you lost, even if it means asking for a candid
answer. If a prospective employer won't grant you an interview,
it's probably because you aren't qualified, you sent in a sloppy
resume or you didn't network well enough to get an introduction to
someone in power.
</P>
<P>
   If you were interviewed but didn't become a finalist, either you
gave a poor interview or your qualifications were only OK. If you
were a finalist, but didn't get the job, either you gave only an OK
interview or the winner was simply better. It happens.
</P>
<P>
   What can you do to be a stronger candidate six months from now?
</P>
<P>
   _ You don't have to share your every waking thought with the
world.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Martina Hingis has small feet; that way both
of them can fit in her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis had already alienated enough people with nasty comments
about Amelie Mauresmo, an openly gay French player. Then the
18-year-old went on to say that Graf was too old to win another
major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Those comments pretty well made sure that most of the crowd was
rooting for Graf, and then Hingis began pouting and whining when
things didn't go her way. That just made the crowd root even harder
for Graf.
</P>
<P>
   When you're young and talented, it's easy to become arrogant.
It's also easy for people to resent you, even if you have done
nothing wrong. If you mix brilliance and humility, though, they'll
have one less reason to resent you.
</P>
<P>
   _ The heart is a pretty resilient little muscle. That's from
another philosopher _ either Woody Allen or Edgar Allan Poe.
</P>
<P>
   Graf was the villain a decade or so ago, but only because she
was the brilliant upstart, and crowds like to cheer for the older
heroes, the ones fighting back from injuries and personal setbacks,
those trying for one last afternoon of glory.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi and Graf have spent years drawing on their physical
abilities, but this time the strength came from inside. And when
they won, both of them had tears in their eyes. Sometimes emotions
get stronger, too.

WOMEN'S GAME HAS ARRIVED, IN BIG NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   US women have taken the initiative in expanding the scope of
soccer in recent years. But the pioneers, as in men's soccer, were
the English.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dick Kerr Ladies team began its North American tour
with a game Sept. 24, 1922, in Clifton, N.J., the Englishwomen
expected to be playing against women. Instead, the opposition was
provided by a men's professional team, the Paterson Silk Sox, who
took a 6-3 victory before 5,000 fans at Olympic Park. Six days
later, the Englishwomen managed a 4-4 tie with J&AMP;P Coats, another
men's pro team, before 8,500 in Pawtucket, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   According to US Soccer Federation historian Colin Jose,
``Reports indicate the Ladies played very well but that the men
took it easy on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ladies returned home after a few more games, and little was
heard from women's soccer for nearly 70 years. But since the first
international matches were organized in the 1980s, the game's
popularity has grown rapidly. Today there are more than 7 million
registered female players in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Those players and their families will compose a high percentage
of the crowds at the Women's World Cup, which begins Friday. More
than 450,000 tickets have been sold for the tournament, expected to
be the largest women-only sporting event in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foxboro Stadium will have a typical Revolution-type crowd, a
good mixture,'' Revolution general manager Brian O'Donovan said.
``We have sold a lot of group tickets to women's teams and families
who are interested in soccer and play the game, and who have been
following the US women's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely more females buying tickets. But people
are also buying tickets who know this is a world-class event. It's
only a few days away, but I don't it has sunk in that this is
happening. That will change once the event starts.''
</P>
<P>
   The US-Denmark opener at Giants Stadium is expected to attract a
crowd of 60,000. Three Foxboro Stadium dates should have a total of
about 100,000 spectators. Defending champion Norway will meet
Russia in a doubleheader also involving Australia and Ghana at
Foxboro Stadium Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gaining ground? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The US' 1-0 victory over Argentina in Washington Sunday
confirmed Bruce Arena's winning touch, and how graphically
perceptions and performances can change with a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the US was stumbling through the France '98 World
Cup, its image tarnished at best. Now, the team's confidence has
been restored, and it seems capable of achieving results.
</P>
<P>
   But many questions arise from this game:
</P>
<P>
   --Is the US Soccer Federation prepared to capitalize on such
success? There might not be another game of such stature in the US
until next year, leaving the 40,119 in attendance, plus the TV
audience, with a feeling of anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
   --Why is goalkeeper Kasey Keller not more highly valued?
</P>
<P>
   --How can the price of any one Argentinian player _ such as
Killy Gonzalez, Ariel Ortega, Diego Simeone, or Javier Zanetti _
exceed the worth of the entire US national team?
</P>
<P>
   --For a long time, the game in the US was faulted because of low
skill levels and tactical naivete. Those gaps are being closed.
Plus, some of the best athletes in the US are playing soccer and
advancing to national team levels.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the MLS has to figure out how to raise the worth of those
players. Someone is defintely missing an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paying a price &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best indication of the inflation of player prices was
Inter's $48 million purchase of Christian Vieri from Lazio. The
strongest criticisms of the transfer came from L'Osservatore
Romano, the newspaper of the Vatican, and German media.
</P>
<P>
   Inter's ``patron,'' Massimo Moratti, was placed in an
uncomfortable situation when questioned about the transfer just
before he made a donation worth about $200,000 to Emergency, an
organization dedicated to land mine victims. The donation,
designated for construction of a hospital in Afghanistan, was
inspired by Moratti's wife, Milly, who is president of Emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am aware that the money we have given to Emergency is
nothing compared to the millions for Vieri, and I feel
embarrassed,'' Moratti said. ``I understand that these figures are
worrisome. They worry me also. I feel guilty when talking about so
many millions. But when you are the head of a business like Inter,
you assume the responsibility to offer a quality product. These
figures that are circulating for Vieri are normal in the industrial
world, but they are not so well-known, while in soccer, everything
is public.''
</P>
<P>
   German newspapers predicted that the Italians' inflated prices
would lead to a catastrophe, and DFB president Egidius Braun called
for a salary cap. But the climate favors escalation over austerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not possible to limit spending, mainly because laws and
regulations give freedom to the clubs,'' Bayern Munich vice
president Karl Heinz Rumenigge said. ``And even if there is a new,
more restrictive law, there will be ways to hide things, and the
players will want to be paid under the table.''
</P>
<P>
   In the US, sports entities usually have been able to discover
new revenue streams, though often by compromising the integrity of
the game. Soccer also will find those sources. The key will be to
adjust while retaining the essence of the sport.

THE CASE OF THE LEGAL LEVIATHANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVENGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I invited my stockbroker, T. Rex, to lunch to wish him a happy
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   We'd had a terrific business relationship for, what, a hundred
million years or so, but in the past few weeks things had really
changed and now it was time for me to say good-bye. I was going on
line.
</P>
<P>
   The final straw was that Merrill Lynch bombshell. Now the
nation's largest full-service securities firm was offering Internet
trading. All the big brokerage houses were jumping on the
bandwagon. Paine Webber announced two days after Merrill that would
it would provide on-line trading services. Prudential Securities
said in May that it would let its customers trade on line. They're
all chasing after the established Internet trading firms, such as
Charles Schwab and ETrade.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, T. Rex looked glum as he chomped with his big,
serrated teeth on a plate of turtles and lizards. His little arms
dangled helplessly in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   In a switch that was possible only in our modern, high-tech
world, my broker was now the one asking me for advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can it really be,'' he was crying into his ginko cocktail,
``that I'm going the way of the elevator operator and the
milkman?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Face it, pal,'' I said gently, ``you're history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you need me,'' T. Rex insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're stuck in the Cretaceous, old man,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I've got expertise _ experience!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all experts now, T. Rex,'' I informed him, ``and after a
week or two at anything who isn't experienced?''
</P>
<P>
   With his small, vacant eyes, Rex looked confused and haunted.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to be sympathetic. ``Look, Rex,'' I said, ``I've enjoyed
our eons together. It'll be tough for me, too. I don't know what
I'll do with all the money I save not paying your commissions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nothing if not honest and wise,'' my broker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fine pitch for another era,'' I answered. ``What did you
charge me for your honesty and wisdom?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred and fifty bucks a trade is fair,'' Rex offered.
``Why? What're you doing now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``$14.95.''
</P>
<P>
   T. Rex nearly choked on a Compsognathus egg. ``How am I supposed
to survive that?'' he growled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know anything about evolution?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rex shook his giant head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a self-service world now,'' I explained, ``But you, T.
Rex, are still standing there with your stubby little claw out
forever expecting a cut. Get into another line of work, or I'm
afraid I'll be dusting you off one day in some fossil bed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get what you pay for!'' Rex came back combatively. ``Sure,
you can trade on line for a few bucks but . . .but . . .'' He
searched for the right word, but his face went blank. He blinked
his dull eyes and I wondered whether anything was going on inside
that famously tiny brain of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've had a good run,'' I told him. ``Once you're long dead,
everyone will be fascinated by you. Kids will memorize every detail
of your life. They'll make movies about you and play you up like
you're a terrible predator, and try to scare everyone with how
ferocious you were. But I know better, pal. I know you were never
anything but a big, lumbering, empty-headed pitchman.''
</P>
<P>
   T. Rex didn't hear a word. He was mumbling, ``This on-line
thing, it came out of nowhere like a humungus meteorite.''

ON WALL STREET, GAYS KEEP A LOW PROIFLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A secret society haunts Wall Street. By day, its
members lie low, taking pains to fit in with the other brokers and
bond traders, waiting until night falls, when they can gather with
their own and, finally, be themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They are the homosexuals of big finance, and, despite New York
City's reputation as a mecca for gay culture and tolerance, most of
them stay in the closet _ while on the job, anyway _ as if they
worked in a small Midwestern town in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to proclaim myself gay,'' said one officer in a
major New York bank, who asked not to be identified, ``I would
definitely be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Industrywide, Wall Street is the most homophobic place you can
work in this city,'' said a securities analyst at a major financial
company.
</P>
<P>
   This aspect of the culture seeped to the surface recently when
Christian L. Curry, a 25-year-old securities analyst, filed a
lawsuit against his former employer, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Curry is demanding an attention-grabbing $1.35 billion, charging
that Morgan Stanley's executives fired him for reasons of
discrimination, partly because he is black, partly because they
thought he was gay. He was fired days after nude photos of him
appeared in a gay pornography magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The Curry case is complicated. Morgan Stanley insists that Curry
was fired for padding his expense account and also contends that he
was caught fabricating racist e-mail on the firm's computer system
to back up his lawsuit. In a further twist, two of the firm's legal
executives were recently forced to resign for paying $10,000 to an
informant who supposedly trapped Curry in his e-mail scam.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever really happened and however the suit turns out, few
gays in the industry have trouble believing that someone on the
Street could get fired for suspicions of being gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not at all surprising,'' said Jennifer Hatch, co-owner of
Christopher Street Financial. The incidence of such firings, she
added, is ``common enough to keep people very much in the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a rough-and-tumble world, where steely nerves, hard drive,
and skyscraper stacks of money are seen as the markers of
manliness. Those whose lifestyles defy the equation often find
themselves hounded out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's company, named after the most famously gay street in
Manhattan's West Village, is the city's only all-gay financial
firm. A former ``high-heeled bond trader'' at J. P. Morgan and Bear
Stearns, Hatch bought Christopher Street from the estate of the
original owner, who died of AIDS two years ago, because she was
weary of role-playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street is a bunch of really insecure people, playing for
very, very high stakes, who don't tolerate any differences,'' she
said. ``I mean, this is a place where everybody's pinstripes are
the same width.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, 38, came to Wall Street right out of college. ``I
remember thinking it was crazy that I'd chosen this field,'' she
said. ``I thought I was the only gay person on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Through reading the gay press, she learned of the New York
Bankers Group, a social and networking organization for gays and
lesbians in the city's financial industry. Even today, the group
remains as low-key as its moniker. It is not listed in the phone
book. Its president, a bank executive, does not want his name to
appear in print.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 people belong to the group. They meet regularly at
restaurants, wine tastings, gallery openings, or at each other's
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a group like this, knowing you're not the only one,''
Hatch said, ``it makes things easier.''
</P>
<P>
   But, many would add, not a lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Daniels, 36, was all set to be named a vice president at the
North American branch of Dresdner Bank. ``My name was up on the
door; the business cards were printed up,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April 1997, he announced he was gay. Within days, he
was fired. The firm said he was let go because of ``downsizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees of securities firms are required to sign a form _
known as the U-4 agreement _ when they join, pledging to settle any
dispute with their employer through an arbitration committee, not
through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Goldberg _ head of Lambda Legal Defense, a gay
civil-liberties organization _ objects to the arbitration rule,
pointing out that lawsuits have been responsible for breaking down
racial and sexual discrimination across many realms of American
social and business life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U-4 clause,'' she said, ``is what has allowed
discrimination to continue to flourish on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels found a way around this obstacle. He sued Dresdner's
parent company _ which is based in Germany, where securities law
contains nothing like a U-4 clause _ and asked for $77 million in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, with the agreement of all parties, the federal judge
handling the case turned it over to arbitration, ruling that
Daniels was technically not an employee of the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels's lawyer, Madeline Bryer, is hopeful of winning anyway.
While the case was still facing federal trial, she conducted a
formal discovery process, taking depositions and amassing evidence,
which are generally not allowed in arbitration cases.
</P>
<P>
   Many are watching the Daniels case as a possible
precedent-setter, as well as Curry's case against Morgan Stanley,
though with mixed feelings because of its more perplexing nature.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one expects dramatic changes overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The bank officer who said he worries about being fired if he
came out of the closet has reason for his fears. In the last Wall
Street firm where he worked, he told his boss he was gay not long
ago, in order to complain about harassment from a colleague. ``That
was on a Friday,'' he recalled. ``On Monday, I was fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street generally is ``a macho culture,'' he went on. ``Most
of the executives are married men, not from Manhattan, who want to
talk about sports, their wives, their kids. Homophobic jokes are
unbelievably commonplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch observed that some older executives _ who long ago rose to
the top, made big bucks for their firms, and stashed away enough
money for themselves _ do feel secure enough to come out or at
least to adopt a blithe indifference to what others might think.
</P>
<P>
   But for the still-rising young star, the coast is far from
clear.
</P>
<P>
   One gay securities analyst, who asked not to be identified, is
worried that some of his supervisors suspect he is gay. ``They look
at me funny at meetings,'' he said. ``I think I make them insecure,
as if they worry that I might be looking at their crotches.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's a job where you don't want to take any chances.
There's probably not another profession where you can make so much
money, so quickly. It's very competitive. People will use anything
against you. I'm always very worried about the security of my job.
Being gay is just an added weight. The paranoia goes very deep.''

BUSH, GORE START DEFINING THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ With any luck, the presidential campaign should
now be able to proceed without the burden of two ridiculous
propositions that have been disseminated by the political
establishment:
</P>
<P>
   1. Texas Governor George Bush has no views.
</P>
<P>
   2. Vice President Al Gore doesn't exist except as an extension
of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   You'd never know it from the silly press coverage of Bush's
first foray out of Austin, but in fact, the governor gave a
self-portrayal in stump speech form that vividly put him on the
Republican map and co-opted rivals in important areas.
</P>
<P>
   And in Gore's case, the endless scouting reports about a
dull-witted Clinton clone are about to clash with the reality as
his own campaign formally begins this week. His campaign is making
much more about the personal and family Gore. And in an interview,
the vice president spoke as someone ``with different priorities,
different approaches, different interests'' _ epitomized by the
zeal he brings to the subject of education, especially for very
young children.
</P>
<P>
   But first, president-in-waiting Bush. In an interesting
decision, he chose his first remarks to declare his support for
cuts in marginal income tax rates and for the diversion of a
portion of federal payroll taxes away from the Social Security
trust fund to support new individualized retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential politics aside, this is a remarkable development.
It matters not at all that Bush isn't ready yet to say which of the
rates he'd cut by how much. The real point is that he made the
basic commitment, which is far more consequential than his awkward
venture last week into special-interest land in vowing to veto
income tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   The reason it's consequential involves both the economy and
Bush's self-identification as a ``compassionate conservative.'' As
Bob Dole discovered in 1996, tax cut proposals that are not
specifically balanced by spending cuts come off in this era as both
irresponsible and lacking credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's proposal of a 15 percent reduction across the board not
only went nowhere for those reasons; in the end it probably
backfired. One reason is that the hole left in the budget _ worth
hundreds of billions of dollars over a decade _ could not be filled
with anything less than an evisceration of federal domestic
programs. And by not being willing to fill it, Dole was vulnerable
to the charge that he was risking the economy's prosperity with a
new round of federal debt and, therefore, interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   The problem would only be compounded by any diversion of
existing Social Security revenue into retirement accounts. The
initial outlay to fund such a diversion (the standard proposal is 2
percentage points of the payroll tax) would be gigantic. And, in
the end, the resulting program would not be Social Security as we
know it.
</P>
<P>
   In a general election, the economy is just about everything.
When told of Bush's remarks, Gore's eyebrows arched. While avoiding
direct comment on words he hadn't seen, he sounded just as he did
in '96 debating Dole's running mate, Jack Kemp, in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Risky tax schemes will drive our economy right back into debt
all over again and threaten our prosperity,'' he said. And on
Social Security, Gore said, ``The key is to preserve the budget
surplus until we are certain Social Security has been saved. And
protecting it, and Medicare also, does not require threatening the
standard of living of the elderly. Above all, the first thing it
requires is that we keep the prosperity going.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bush's move is likely to help him in the Republican
contest, getting a jump on Elizabeth Dole and partially co-opting
Steve Forbes, Dan Quayle, and Lamar Alexander, who have been more
specific and more radical.
</P>
<P>
   His downright confrontational attitude toward the party's right
wing was also significant. Bush was most explicit in denouncing
protectionism and advocating ``free trade'' (take that, Pat
Buchanan and Gary Bauer). But it should have been noted that in his
maiden voyage he had nothing at all to say about stopping abortion,
promoting school vouchers, restricting immigration, denouncing gun
control, or attacking the supposedly immoral popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing for the country that could come from a Bush
nomination, won convincingly and early, would be his and the
party's liberation from the right's vice-grip. Let's see if he
stays independent.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the candidate I heard over the weekend who was
most upset about a status quo was Gore. He spoke about ``a crisis
confronting the American family'' involving work, health care, and
education, creating what he called a ``serious care deficit.'' He
doesn't belabor the point about his total identification with the
president's record and his deep involvement in it. Instead, turning
to the future, he shows much greater zeal about a new set of
issues.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to assume that either of these guys will be
nominees 14 months hence. But it's not too early to argue that the
standard descriptions of Bush and Gore are mostly wrong and that
theirs would be a serious, consequential campaign.

THE CASE OF THE LEGAL LEVIATHANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I invited my stockbroker, T. Rex, to lunch to wish him a happy
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   We'd had a terrific business relationship for, what, a hundred
million years or so, but in the past few weeks things had really
changed and now it was time for me to say good-bye. I was going on
line.
</P>
<P>
   The final straw was that Merrill Lynch bombshell. Now the
nation's largest full-service securities firm was offering Internet
trading. All the big brokerage houses were jumping on the
bandwagon. Paine Webber announced two days after Merrill that would
it would provide on-line trading services. Prudential Securities
said in May that it would let its customers trade on line. They're
all chasing after the established Internet trading firms, such as
Charles Schwab and ETrade.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, T. Rex looked glum as he chomped with his big,
serrated teeth on a plate of turtles and lizards. His little arms
dangled helplessly in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   In a switch that was possible only in our modern, high-tech
world, my broker was now the one asking me for advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can it really be,'' he was crying into his ginko cocktail,
``that I'm going the way of the elevator operator and the
milkman?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Face it, pal,'' I said gently, ``you're history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you need me,'' T. Rex insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're stuck in the Cretaceous, old man,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I've got expertise _ experience!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all experts now, T. Rex,'' I informed him, ``and after a
week or two at anything who isn't experienced?''
</P>
<P>
   With his small, vacant eyes, Rex looked confused and haunted.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to be sympathetic. ``Look, Rex,'' I said, ``I've enjoyed
our eons together. It'll be tough for me, too. I don't know what
I'll do with all the money I save not paying your commissions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nothing if not honest and wise,'' my broker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fine pitch for another era,'' I answered. ``What did you
charge me for your honesty and wisdom?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred and fifty bucks a trade is fair,'' Rex offered.
``Why? What're you doing now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``$14.95.''
</P>
<P>
   T. Rex nearly choked on a Compsognathus egg. ``How am I supposed
to survive that?'' he growled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know anything about evolution?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rex shook his giant head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a self-service world now,'' I explained, ``But you, T.
Rex, are still standing there with your stubby little claw out
forever expecting a cut. Get into another line of work, or I'm
afraid I'll be dusting you off one day in some fossil bed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get what you pay for!'' Rex came back combatively. ``Sure,
you can trade on line for a few bucks but . . .but . . .'' He
searched for the right word, but his face went blank. He blinked
his dull eyes and I wondered whether anything was going on inside
that famously tiny brain of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've had a good run,'' I told him. ``Once you're long dead,
everyone will be fascinated by you. Kids will memorize every detail
of your life. They'll make movies about you and play you up like
you're a terrible predator, and try to scare everyone with how
ferocious you were. But I know better, pal. I know you were never
anything but a big, lumbering, empty-headed pitchman.''
</P>
<P>
   T. Rex didn't hear a word. He was mumbling, ``This on-line
thing, it came out of nowhere like a humungus meteorite.''

ANOTHER MUSICAL TAYLOR EMBARKS ON A CAREER OF HER OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHAMPTON, Mass. _ Sally Taylor is one of those rare
20-somethings who meet the gaze of a stranger, and hold it. We are
face to face on futon couches upstairs at the Iron Horse in
Northampton _ killing time between sound check and her 7 p.m. set _
talking about music and family, boyfriends and philosophy, and the
relative merits of the ocean versus the mountains. Taylor's a
tanned, strapping beauty who rowed crew in high school at the Tabor
Academy on Buzzards Bay and rambled through Third World countries
as an anthropology student at Brown. At 24, Taylor is on her first
concert tour. Every inch of her 5-foot-10-inch frame is poised and
alert, yet supremely relaxed, as she arranges her long limbs on the
sofa _ and prepares to move into the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   One would suspect that Sally Taylor's remarkable genetic
endowment, as the daughter of folk-pop luminaries James Taylor and
Carly Simon, has supplied her with the equivalent of first-class
passage into the inner sanctum of the music industry. Just look at
the recent crop of prominent artists' offspring who have made
splashy recording debuts _ from Sean Lennon and Rufus Wainwright to
Jakob Dylan and Tal Bachman. But Taylor has benefited not only from
a rich musical heritage, she has reaped the rewards of a caring and
conscientious upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents were like, `Set yourself up so that you're living
your life exactly the way you want to live it, and don't
compromise,' '' she recalls. Taylor and Simon married in 1972 and
divorced 10 years later, when Sally was 6. Following her parents'
split, Sally spent most weeks with her mother and most weekends
with her father, shuttling back and forth between their homes in
Manhattan and Martha's Vineyard. The generational legacy is rich
both with musical inspiration and the knowledge that it would never
be easy to follow in her famous parents' footsteps. ``They were a
huge influence, in many ways. There have been many times when they
said, `Do not go into the music business. Run away.' But what they
really did was teach us to follow our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's heart (and a boyfriend, long gone now) led her two
years ago to the idyllic Rocky Mountain town of Boulder, Colo. _
literally and figuratively as distant from the coastal epicenters
of the music business as possible. There she recorded a handful of
songs, co-produced by Taylor and her friend Wendy Woo, in a
makeshift studio 3 miles down a dirt road. Listen closely, and you
can hear crickets chirping on the quieter tracks. Twelve tunes that
were originally intended to be demos, a way of organizing her
growing collection of compositions so that they wouldn't wind up on
a million different cassettes in the glove compartment, wound up
becoming ``Tomboy Bride,'' Sally Taylor's debut CD. She released it
last fall on her own Blue Elbow label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Taylor says, her face lighting up in a huge
smile. ``It's just the raw deal, you know, it's not decked out in
production.'' Indeed, it's the raw deal _ as opposed to the
major-label deal _ that holds meaning for Taylor, who has turned
down a handful of lucrative offers from record companies eager to
snap up the next generation of folk-rock royalty. She sells the CD
from a folding table after her gigs, and through her Web site, at
www.sallytaylor.com. So far she's sold 5,500 copies, and she's
happy as a clam. Luckily, there's little need for a day job.
``Sometimes I look at those opportunities,'' Taylor muses of the
numerous offers from labels, ``and they really do look like
opportunities. But then I realize that they're actually
compromises, compromising who I want to be, and who I'm becoming.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This sort of earnest self-reflection fills Taylor's
conversation. She looks back at a life filled with music _ but no
formal training _ and is hard pressed to put her finger on the
genesis of her own creative inclinations. ``I was just up on
Martha's Vineyard Monday, and my mom pulls out these tapes. She
made tons of tapes of us growing up.'' Us is Taylor and her
21-year-old brother Ben, whose first CD _ described by Sally as a
wild convergence of hip-hop and folk _ is being released by Sony
later this year. ``Every single one is of me going `nanananana,'
singing, and then I suddenly stop singing and go, `Let's listen.''
I remember asking her back then, I guess I was around 8, if she
could teach me to write a song. And she said, `You know, if you're
meant to be a singer, if you're meant to be a songwriter, it will
just come to you.' I'm so grateful that she said that. I feel like
she gave me my independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor started writing songs when she was 15. She sang melodies
into a tape recorder, not even picking up a guitar until she was
nearly out of college. ``I didn't want people to get the wrong
idea,'' she says, her voice quieting, ``of me being out there
trying to prove something.'' She delved into her studies in medical
anthropology _ a pursuit, she confirms with a sudden laugh, that
was the polar opposite of music. ``Oh, yeah. Where do you think
that came from? But I think it was less a rebellion and more
insecurity. Because I thought, `I'll never be good enough.' What I
was actually doing then was somehow comparing myself to my parents,
and when I realized that, it was like, `Stop being a victim of your
life. Do what you believe in doing.' But I went through everything.
I went through going, `This is so wrong,' and being so scared. But
being scared and doing it anyway. Of course people are going to
make comparisons. Music,'' says Taylor, ``just seemed like what was
in my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomboy Bride'' bears the classic marks of an emerging artist.
The songs are sweet, simply arranged, and filled with heartfelt,
pensive lyrics. While she moves through familiar folk-rock
territory, scattered with occasional jazzy inflections, neither
Taylor's songs nor her singing much resemble that of her mother or
father. (Ben, on the other hand, is a ringer for his dad in both
voice and visage.) The one exception is the album's title song, a
lilting, measured ballad that recalls James's graceful
interpretations of traditional folk forms.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is eager to analyze songwriting styles. ``My mom's and my
brother's are very similar, just by accident,'' Taylor begins.
``She writes all the words first, then writes all the music over
it. I could never do it. My dad gets an idea, an image or a
scenario, and then he writes to that. I can't do that, either.''
Coincidentally, Taylor's uncle Livingston appears at our table
during this discussion of the family trade. Hugs and happy
greetings abound, but the elder Taylor graciously declines our
invitation to contribute his own recipe for cooking up a song.
Sally continues: ``Me, I sit down and start strumming, and usually
those chords put me in a certain mood. I play it a few more times,
and I get in touch with a feeling, and then from that emotion
springs the words.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On stage, Taylor is radiant. Her wild blond curls are corralled
in a knot at the back of her neck, and her sleek black top, full
skirt, and funky leather boots are reminiscent of an earlier time,
circa ``Anticipation.'' Taylor's most captivating natural gift is
her singing voice, a rich alto that sounds more like Natalie
Merchant than any blood relation; it flows warm and easy, like her
banter between songs, during the band's 40-minute set. In clusters
at tables, in line for the restrooms, people are talking about this
new young singer. Sally Taylor knows what they are talking about;
indeed, she knows why they are here at her show at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That knowledge, knowing who my parents are, is going to be the
first thing on their minds. That's totally fair,'' Taylor asserts.
For a young person trying to establish an identity in the same
field as her prominent, beloved parents, the obstacles _ as Taylor
is acutely aware _ are at least equal to the advantages. It takes a
hardy soul to turn away from an open door, but Taylor believes it's
her best shot at success.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the hardest thing, to keep my idea of success _ being
happy _ as the main focus,'' she says. ``People come to me and they
have a different perception of success. They put it on the table
and say, `If you want to be successful, sign on the dotted line.'
And I say, `Well, I actually am successful.' When I think about
signing a record deal and plastering myself up on something, then I
worry, like a mother, about myself. Like these people are going to
create me, and I haven't even created myself yet,'' says Taylor,
who manages her own career.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Taylor has already written material _ between
showshoeing trips and epic knitting sessions, her other passions _
for a second CD. She's on tour through the fall, and may include a
Boston stop in August or September. Come winter, she'll go back
into the studio with her band, in Boulder. That town, it would
seem, is the perfect hide-out. ``It's not that I'm staying out
there to avoid confrontation with the music industry. It's not
that. I'm just really enjoying owning my own space, owning my own
time. And I feel like, well, Boulder's a perfect place to . . .''
Taylor breaks off her thought, and looks down at her hands. For the
first time all evening, she speaks without making eye contact.
``What I'm saying is that I'm still insecure. And scared of what I
could be persuaded to become.'' Then she looks up, blue eyes clear
and calm. ``In Boulder I don't have the self-doubt. I'm free to
create. And become exactly what I want.''

SILVER CHARM SIMPLY RAN OUT OF STEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Simply put, Silver Charm went sour. It happens to many
thoroughbreds; they reach the point where they don't want to race
anymore. Some get ``smart'' and come to realize, after suffering
various nicks and bruises, that it hurts when they extend
themselves, so they stop doing it. Some just lose interest in
competing; they get bored with the game. For the 5-year-old Silver
Charm, who was always a bit quirky and difficult to train, it took
24 starts to throw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   After Silver Charm ran an uninterested fourth in the $827,250
Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs Saturday, his fourth
loss in a row, his connections had seen enough. Owners Bob and
Beverly Lewis and trainer Bob Baffert made the decision to retire
the big gray Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm became a popular horse after winning the Kentucky
Derby and Preakness in 1997. He also ran well in the Belmont, but
missed the Triple Crown when Touch Gold passed him nearing the wire
to win by 3/4-length. The Lewises and Baffert had been known in
racing circles, but it was Silver Charm that vaulted them into
national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of record that Silver Charm logged a lot of miles.
He made the arduous trip to Dubai twice, winning in '98 and
finishing sixth this year, and raced at tracks all around this
country. That was good for the sport but probably contributed to
Silver Charm's early retirement. He also was bothered, off and on,
with a bleeding problem, and that didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   The last hurrah for Silver Charm came Jan. 10 at Santa Anita,
when he won the San Pasqual. After that, he ran third in the Donn
at Gulfstream, third in the Santa Anita Handicap, then came the
Dubai World Cup and the Foster. A son of Silver Buck, out of a
Poker mare, Silver Charm goes to stud with a record of 24-12-7-2
and earnings of $6,944,369, behind only Skip Away ($9,616,360) and
Cigar ($9,999,815). Not bad for a $35,000 purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retiring Silver Charm was something that's been in my mind for
some time,'' said Bob Lewis. ``He ran a creditable race in the
Stephen Foster, and he came out of it in grand style, but he
certainly didn't show the ability to run with that class of horses
any longer. He doesn't seem to have the late kick he did have, and
he doesn't seem to have the high level of competitive spirit he
showed when he performed so magnificently in the Triple Crown races
and in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than demean the horse after such a great career, we
feel it's the appropriate time to go on to the next stage in his
life, out in the pasture, serving as a stallion.''
</P>
<P>
   As so often happens in this mercurial sport, the Lewises,
racing's greatest ambassadors, went from the top to the bottom in
less than a month. On May 15, Charismatic, also owned by the
Lewises, won the Preakness after taking the Derby, and, like Silver
Charm before him, had the chance for the Triple Crown, which
carries with it both a page in the record books and a $5 million
bonus. However, Charismatic broke down while finishing third in the
Belmont June 5, and he, too, was retired. Truly, the Lewises took
three strikes, because their Exploit, probably the best of the
3-year-olds and the winter book favorite to win the Derby, was
injured in the San Felipe at Santa Anita March 13, and also was
sent to stud.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Galloping to victory
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop, who had run third in Dubai March 28, dominated
the Foster, pulling away through the stretch to win by nearly 6
lengths under Jerry Bailey. It was a dazzling performance by the
4-year-old, who ran 1 1/8 miles in 1:47 1/5, shattering the track
record by one and one-fifth seconds, the equivalent of 6 lengths.
Victory Gallop was 6-5 ($4.60 to win), while Silver Charm was 7-5
with Chris Antley.
</P>
<P>
   The victory proved that a horse based in the United States can
bounce back in a reasonable amount of time from the rigors of the
Dubai trek. Up till now, the record had not been good, as most of
the US steeds had come back knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   A son of Cryptoclearance, Victory Gallop won last year's Belmont
Stakes to deny Real Quiet the Triple Crown. He also ran second in
the Derby, Preakness, Haskell, and Travers, and fourth in the
Breeders' Cup Classic. There is no doubt that Victory Gallop, who
is trained by Elliott Walden, has joined Behrens at the top of the
handicap ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke alertly, but dropped farther back than I thought he'd
be,'' said Bailey. ``When we got to the far turn, he gave me the
most powerful move around a turn from any horse I've ever been
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Next for Victory Gallop could be the Whitney at Saratoga Aug. 1,
but the big summer goal is the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del
Mar Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A `Stag' party
</P>
<P>
   If there was one horse who could have given Victory Gallop a run
Saturday, it was Running Stag, who was nearly as sensational in
winning the $350,000 Brooklyn Handicap at Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently second behind Behrens in the MassCap at Suffolk
May 29, Running Stag, an invader from England, stormed through the
lane to tally by more than 7 lengths with Shane Sellers in the
irons. Running Stag covered the 9 furlongs in a rapid 1:46 1/5, but
he was not about to break the track record, which was established
when Secretariat ran 1:45 2/5 in 1973. Running Stag was 7-2,
returning $7.90 to win.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Philip Mitchell and Sellers switched tactics for the
score. In the MassCap, Running Stag went right to the front; he
came from far back in the Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just relaxed, and he made a huge move on the turn,''
said Sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell now intends to bring Running Stag back to England.

LINDA GREENLAW'S `OCEAN' MAY LEAVE READERS HUNGRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE DANIEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE HUNGRY OCEAN 
A Swordboat Captain's Journey 
By Linda Greenlaw 
Hyperion, 265 pp., $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda Greenlaw sums up the reason for her book ``The Hungry
Ocean'' in the first sentence of the preface: ``I have been fishing
commercially for seventeen years, and up until the summer of 1997
nobody cared. With the publication of Sebastian Junger's `The
Perfect Storm' came attention and opportunity. In general, people
are intrigued with my life as the captain of the Hannah Boden,
sister ship to the Andrea Gail,'' the ship Junger profiled.
</P>
<P>
   My hunch is that the intrigue Greenlaw mentions is largely due
to her gender: She was the first and so far only female commercial
swordfish captain. She has since, inexplicably, retired from the
Hannah Boden helm, according to the book's epilogue, and now fishes
inshore for lobster in the waters surrounding her home on Isle au
Haut, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Upfront, Greenlaw eschews drawing attention to her womanhood
(``I am a fisherman''), though it comes out unavoidably in many
ways during the book. Her gender certainly shouldn't be the book's
sole subject, but one would think it has played a part in her
working life _ or at least in getting a book contract. But she
says, ``I never anticipated problems stemming from being female,
and never encountered any. . . . People, women in particular, are
generally disappointed when they learn that I have not suffered
unduly from being the only woman in what they perceive to be a
man's world.'' Perceive? She's the only woman mentioned in the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Feminist theory aside, ``The Hungry Ocean'' is a so-so read.
Maybe it's like fishing: There's a lot of routine, chores, minutiae
_ and now and then you get a bite. Greenlaw doles out only a few of
those nibbles, but has spared no detail about a particular 30-day
cruise with a five-man crew out of Gloucester in late August 1992.
I liked the idea of going on one trip with the gang, but was
disappointed that there was scant character development or action
and that much of the writing is cliched. Poetic phrases pop up here
and there, but ``The Hungry Ocean'' has none of the thrills or
chills of ``The Perfect Storm.'' Its drama is instead found in the
little things _ finding fish, jockeying for position and
aggressively holding a 40-mile-long piece of the sea, keeping
sharks from ruining equipment, trying to maintain an orderly and
energetic crew, and praying that the price of fish will be decent
when it's time to cash in the catch.
</P>
<P>
   A friend tells me that her lobsterman brother-in-law and his
fisherman friends love this book, and I'm not surprised. It really
gets inside their jobs (not so much their lives). Problem is, those
jobs aren't always very exciting. Fishing can be dangerous, and
it's unbelievably difficult work, but it can also be quite tedious.
If, however, you're interested in learning about longlining, how
dopplers and down temps work, the latest in mapping technology, and
all the other technicalities, Greenlaw will teach you tons. And I
certainly have a greater appreciation for the swordfish on my
dinner plate.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Perfect Storm'' Junger wrote of Greenlaw with
admiration, for she is a top-notch captain. She tells us that
``getting to the top of the heap was a painful journey,'' but never
explains how.
</P>
<P>
   She treats the crew members, who call her ``Ma'' (no attention
to her gender there, huh?), mostly with respect. They often comment
to her, ``not bad for a girl.'' There's a disturbing scene in which
crew member Kenny blurts out the boat's position and amazing daily
catch (which Greenlaw had publicly downplayed) over the radio,
thereby cluing in the competition. She calls him a moron, among
other things, and berates him nonstop for a day. Enough already.
Then she goes on to say: ``I thought, if I were a man, I would be
punching him right square in the nose for his stupidity.'' But
she's a fisherman, isn't she?
</P>
<P>
   Part of her reaction to that event was based on the guilt she
felt about telling fellow fishermen that the Hannah Boden's catch
was low when in fact it was record-breaking. ``I wasn't sure what
made me feel worse, the certainty that we would now have to share
this productive piece of water with the competition or having been
exposed as a liar. . . . As mad as I was at Kenny, I was just as
ashamed of myself for lying in the first place.'' She then spends
several pages reflecting on the ethics of the situation. Again,
this is just a hunch, but I don't think a man would do that.
</P>
<P>
   She alludes to matters of the heart, and even to abstinence, but
isn't forthcoming on the subject. Considering that she was the only
female aboard her fishing vessels for a month at a time, one can't
help but wonder if any romances blossomed, or if sexual tension
ever interfered with work.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlaw does, however, share her passion for the sea. And that
is really what makes her story worthwhile. It is genuine and, in
some ways, a love story: a lifelong love of the sea and the
seafaring life.

A BLOW TO POETIC POPPIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent Sunday's perfect weather was a double blessing: It
meant readers were too busy enjoying life to notice my misquotation
of a famous line of poetry. (A pessimist might wonder if the real
reason is that nobody knows ``In Flanders Fields'' at all anymore,
but I prefer to blame, or credit, the June sunshine.)
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the exception was Willie Lockeretz of Brookline,
Mass., who shot off an e-mail before I was even conscious on Sunday
morning. He agreed that memorizing poems beats memorizing spelling
words, but, he chided, the poetry has to be memorized accurately:
`` `In Flanders fields the poppies blow' (not grow).''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed: ``In Flanders fields the poppies blow/ Between the
crosses, row on row,'' the World War I poem begins. The poppies do
``grow'' eventually, but not till the 14th of 15 lines. A shocking
gaffe, one week after Memorial Day, and the more so because I was
looking at the text, not relying on memory. It was a moment of
brain burnout, pure and simple.
</P>
<P>
   That circuit must have been shorting out two weeks earlier, too,
when I wondered in this space why crispy would be (even
momentarily) a slang word for badly hung over. Elementary, my dear,
said readers: Fried is slang for drunk (or stoned), and it takes
only a bit more cooking to get to crispy. Calvin Saxton of
Willington, Conn., pointed to those sizzling eggs in the TV public
service ads: ``This is your brain. This is your brain on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Crispy may have been a flash in the pan, in the
substance-abuse-slang department, but fried is practically a
classic: Under ``Intoxication,'' the Oxford University Press slang
dictionary quotes Noel Coward, in 1923, writing ``After a gay
reunion party . . . I retired to be slightly fried, blissfully
happy.'' This was apparently only the latest in a series of
alcoholic synonyms accumulating as the '20s roared along:
``Princeton has completed the idiom of the cuisine by adding fried
to boiled and stewed,'' according to a 1926 source.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fried has worked hard in other realms of slang _ to
mean angry (or steamed), for instance, and as a synonym for
electrocuted. It can still refer to alcohol's effects, but any kind
of drug is covered: French fries, mere potatoes in Noel Coward's
partying days, are also a kind of crack cocaine. More benignly,
though, fried now seems to be poaching on the territory of burned
out. For people too busy to stay out late, ``my brain is fried'' is
more likely to suggest overwork than overindulgence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Remember the alamode &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out of the frying pan for a brief vacation, I was at lunch with
friends in California last month when we asked for a serving of
berry pie to share. It was delicious, and so was the new verb that
came with it: ``Would you like to alamode that?'' asked the waiter.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to blame it on California, but let's be fair: All
over the country, menus have ``beef with au jus'' and ``today's
special du jour,'' along with waiterly transgressions of all sorts.
It could happen here.
</P>
<P>
   And in the waiter's defense, English has played fast and loose
with a la mode for centuries. We stole it in the 17th century,
freely throwing it around as adverb, adjective, and noun, and
writing it in various ways, says the Oxford English Dictionary. It
was alamode and all-a-mode and a-la-mode _ but at least it still
meant ``in the fashion.'' In America, we gave it a whole new
meaning _ ``with ice cream'' _ and pretty much dropped the old one.
</P>
<P>
   But even this had happened before. Alamode Beef, an 18th-century
dish made of boiled larded beef scraps, was once a menu standard;
as recently as 1992, chef Pierre Franey wrote about this close
relative of the New England boiled dinner.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's never been a verb before _ as far as we know. But some
anonymous cook might have turned to her spouse, one day in 1799,
and asked, ``Shall we alamode the leftovers?'' English has always
been free with its parts of speech _ empty and sober up are also
adjective-to-verb conversions _ and if this one had caught on two
centuries ago, we wouldn't be batting an eye at it now.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time a waiter asks ``Shall I alamode that?'' I'm not
going to fuss; instead, I'll give thanks that he's not offering
boiled beef, and just say yes.
</P>

FRESH FACE AMID STALE POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW CASTLE, N.H. _ He stood at the podium with an amused look on
his face, stood under a white tent at what could have been an
old-fashioned revival meeting. And for a few enlightening moments
Monday morning, you began to understand why it is that Democrats
live in mortal fear of a politician with the relatively benign name
of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Like him or not, Bush is fresh. Vice President Al Gore seems so
irreversibly stale. Bush is mischievous. Gore is gratingly
straight. Bush is dynamic. Gore seems stuck in a time _ the era of
Clinton scandal _ that voters would rather forget.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into his first telling trip of a long primary campaign,
the fear among local Republicans was that Bush would seem overly
programmed, that every self-important adviser out of Washington
would have wrung the personality out of a politician who otherwise
glows in the presence of cameras and voters.
</P>
<P>
   No. In New Hampshire just a few minutes, he wrapped his arm
around the shoulder of activist Ruth Griffin, pointed to her cowboy
boots and yelled in his Texas twang, ``My kind of girl.'' Kneeling
between a pair of tow-headed schoolkids, he said to nearby
cameramen, ``I'm always preening.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, spying ever-unctuous CNBC commentator Chris Matthews at a
press conference, Bush called from the stage, ``It's good to see
the larger personalities are starting to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   He is both a force and a freak of political nature, an
overwhelming front-runner in a campaign in which he's barely had
time to ask for a vote. The public doesn't yet know him, and what
people knew of his father, they didn't seem to like.
</P>
<P>
   And when he outlines his vision for the nation's future, he
speaks in only the broadest of terms, raising such themes as
``compassionate conservatism,'' and saying that no American should
be left behind. Some staunch conservatives flinch at such
liberal-leaning talk, but the rank and file partisans don't seem to
mind. And for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   In the Washington of 1999, Republicans hate Democrats and
Democrats hate Republicans. Accomplishment isn't measured in new
laws, but in successful political jabs. President Clinton blames
House Republicans for his ethical problems because of his inability
to blame himself. House Republicans blame Clinton for a national
stalemate out of a moronically miscalculated belief that fault is
what voters want.
</P>
<P>
   And along comes Bush. In Texas, he refused to utter a negative
word in his upset victory over incumbent Governor Ann Richards in
1994, then worked so closely with Democratic legislators to pass
his first-term program that he was loath to campaign against them
in last year's state elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you can't lead by dividing people, pitting one against
another,'' Bush said Monday. ``I don't like the trash-mouthed
politics of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   I met Bush in 1995, when he was a new governor and thoughts of
any higher office took voice only in the dreamy whispers of his
most ambitious aides. Failing to get an interview, I attended his
public events near Dallas one day. As he headed for the airport, he
stopped and asked why I'd been following him.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, I was in the back of his sedan, then rumbling
above the Texas hill country in his state-issue plane as he
stretched out with a bottle of water in his hand waxing about
politics and life. After touchdown, he cleared his afternoon
schedule, and after a lengthy interview, invited me to the
governor's mansion for a personal tour.
</P>
<P>
   He was self-aware, while most politicians are simply
self-absorbed, unguarded to the point of being refreshing. He
talked without the benefit of aides or any overt caution, joked
about his golf game (a country club swing, public course handicap,
he said), his love for his mother, the deafening bus stop outside
his house. His laugh echoed off his office walls.
</P>
<P>
   No more, such liberties. More than 100 reporters accompanied
Bush from Austin to Iowa to New Hampshire, on a campaign trip that
resembled the throes of a general election and a traveling
operation as sophisticated as that of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   None of this qualifies him to be president. There are issues to
prod, proposals to flesh out, a background to explore. Those who
claim that a candidate with the name of George Walker would never
be a front-runner raise a valid point.
</P>
<P>
   But like him or not, agree with him or not, Bush will add a
sense of civility badly needed in a national campaign. After too
many fund-raising scandals, too many lies, too many bombs lobbed
over partisan lines, he is a welcome sight for an electorate that
has grown too accustomed to negative news.

 &HT;    TALL TALES &AMP; SHORT STORIES: To change one mind, change a hundred
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nothing worse than being broke in the big city. And
I'm as good as broke if I can't break this $100 bill.
</P>
<P>
   That's all I have in my wallet. I need to take a taxi back to my
hotel, about a $5 ride. No way I can ask a cabbie to make change
for a bill that size.
</P>
<P>
   So here I am, standing in a long line, a stranger in a strange
bank, hoping I can trade in this hundred for some twenties and
tens. But I have my doubts.
</P>
<P>
   I just know what the teller is going to do. I'll hand him the
bill and, in the nicest possible way, ask for change.
</P>
<P>
   He'll look at the hundred for a long moment, almost as if he's
never seen one before, and then he'll look at me, and for sure he's
never seen me before. I know what he's going to ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have an account with us?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, I'm from out of town, just visiting here for a week or
so. But the hundred is all I have with me and I need to get a cab
back to my hotel, but you know how cab drivers are _ I'll smile and
shrug _ so I was hoping that you could ...
</P>
<P>
   He won't even let me finish, shoving the bill through the window
at me, and not even looking at me _ already looking past me at the
next person in line _ and saying what I know he'll say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry. You have to have an account here to do business here.''
</P>
<P>
   And I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to get angry. For a
fact, I'm already getting angry just thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' I'll say, poking the bill back through the window.
``This is no big deal for you, but it'll help me out. Like I said,
I'm a visitor, and all I need is some change. Surely, breaking a
hundred isn't going to break you, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm smiling, but my voice has an edge to it, and by now I'm
leaning into the window.
</P>
<P>
   But in that same tired, couldn't-care-less kind of voice that
people in the big city use, I can hear him repeating himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry. You have to have an account here to do business here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when I'll explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of bank is that?'' I'll demand, my voice rising.
``All I'm asking is some lousy change for a lousy $100 bill! For
cripes sake, as one human being to another, help me out!''
</P>
<P>
   Now I've got his attention. Now he's looking at me, his eyes
widening, and so is everyone else in the bank, including the
security guard who is beginning to move in my direction. I don't
care. There's just so much a man can put up with.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I'm telling the rest of the people in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about you?'' I'm asking the poor, frightened lady behind
me, all but shouting. ``You've got an account here, haven't you?
Well, haven't you?!''
</P>
<P>
   She bites her lip and nods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here then,'' I say, trying to push the $100 bill into her
hand. ``You get change for me. Is that asking too much. Is it,
huh?!''
</P>
<P>
   She pulls away, so I turn my attention to the rest of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody? Won't anybody help out? Tell you what, then! Five
bucks. Get me change for the hundred and I'll give you $5. Nobody?
Then how about $10 ...''
</P>
<P>
   At this point I was interrupted by a voice, this one for real.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I help you, sir?'' said the teller, and I realized that
I'd finally moved up to the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change for a hundred?'' I snarled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tens and twenties OK?'' he said, already counting them out.
</P>
<P>
   I nodded. He smiled. I took my money and moved away from the
window.
</P>
<P>
   Nice bank. If I lived here, I think I'd open an account with
them.

into soups and pasta dishes, or filled with stuffings like cheese
and anchovies, or simply dipped into a light batter and fried. The
blossoms have a subtle flavor and a wildly beautiful shape, which

STRESS MAY INTERFERE WITH THE THRILL OF GIVING BIRTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Bellevue Woman's Hospital is CQ)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NISKAYUNA, N.Y. _ Theresa O'Connell felt nothing but joy when
she held her baby for the first time last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute I saw her, it was like, `What was I worried
about?''' O'Connell said about her daughter, Devon Grace, born May
24.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are O'Connell won't have anything to worry about beyond
the usual stress and fatigue of new parenthood. But for one in
every 10 new mothers, the months after delivery offer a profound
sense of sadness, hopelessness, mood swings and insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   Postpartum depression, as it's known, is fairly common, though
not well understood and often underdiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American myth is that when you have a baby, you should be
glowing, blossoming,'' said Dr. Norman Possner, an obstetrician and
gynecologist at the Albany Medical Center Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for a variety of reasons, childbirth can trigger severe
depression in some women, making it difficult for them care for
themselves and an infant that needs round-the-clock attention.
</P>
<P>
   Left untreated, such depression, in rare causes, can lead to
suicide or infanticide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's not really recognized,'' said Deborah
Chesky, the social work manager at Bellevue Woman's Hospital in
Niskayuna, a town north of Albany. ``Often the woman feels ashamed,
`The baby is fine, why do I feel this way?'''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are learning more about how a mother's mood may
affect her baby's long-term development.
</P>
<P>
   Though 50 to 75 percent of new mothers suffer from the ``baby
blues'' in the days after delivery, such sadness disappears after
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Postpartum depression, on the other hand, can occur anytime
within the first year of the baby's birth and the symptoms persist
longer than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study at Emory University in Atlanta found that both
depressed mothers and their babies have increased amounts of the
hormone cortisol in their blood, an indication of stress.
</P>
<P>
   Such high levels can make these infants vulnerable to
overreacting to stress later in life.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a depressed mother is more likely to withdraw from
her baby, reducing the amount of positive interaction between the
two, Possner said. Such interaction is important for the baby's
overall development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more serious than a lot of things that obstetricians
take care of during pregnancy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem with postpartum depression has been
diagnosing it. Women with the problem are often the last ones to
admit something is wrong, because of fear and shame.
</P>
<P>
   Possner and researchers at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y.,
are studying ways to help predict, before the birth, which women
might be most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Postpartum depression is almost always treatable with
medications and psychotherapy,'' said Karen Williams, an associate
professor of biology and the Health Professions Counselor at Union
College. ``There's no reason for people to suffer through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue Woman's Hospital has been participating in the research
by distributing the questionnaire to women before and after they
have their babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a psychic PAP test,'' Possner said, referring to
the common screening test for cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe women without the support of close family or
friends are often most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts say that women with a personal or family history
of depression are more likely to experience it. And women who have
had postpartum depression in an earlier pregnancy also are at
greater risk in subsequent births.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the level of depression, a combination of
medication and therapy may be recommended. Most women who are
prescribed medication, which requires them to stop breast-feeding,
see improvement in three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Possner believes one simple question can help gauge the
well-being of any new mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite question is, `Are you happy?''' he said. ``That's
a shocker to most ladies. If there's a sudden blank pause and they
break into tears, you've got a problem.''

STRESS MAY INTERFERE WITH THE THRILL OF GIVING BIRTH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NISKAYUNA, N.Y. _ Theresa O'Connell felt nothing but joy when
she held her baby for the first time last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute I saw her, it was like, `What was I worried
about?''' O'Connell said about her daughter, Devon Grace, born May
24.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are O'Connell won't have anything to worry about beyond
the usual stress and fatigue of new parenthood. But for one in
every 10 new mothers, the months after delivery offer a profound
sense of sadness, hopelessness, mood swings and insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   Postpartum depression, as it's known, is fairly common, though
not well understood and often underdiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American myth is that when you have a baby, you should be
glowing, blossoming,'' said Dr. Norman Possner, an obstetrician and
gynecologist at the Albany Medical Center Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for a variety of reasons, childbirth can trigger severe
depression in some women, making it difficult for them care for
themselves and an infant that needs round-the-clock attention.
</P>
<P>
   Left untreated, such depression, in rare causes, can lead to
suicide or infanticide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's not really recognized,'' said Deborah
Chesky, the social work manager at Bellevue Woman's Hospital in
Niskayuna, a town north of Albany. ``Often the woman feels ashamed,
`The baby is fine, why do I feel this way?'''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are learning more about how a mother's mood may
affect her baby's long-term development.
</P>
<P>
   Though 50 to 75 percent of new mothers suffer from the ``baby
blues'' in the days after delivery, such sadness disappears after
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Postpartum depression, on the other hand, can occur anytime
within the first year of the baby's birth and the symptoms persist
longer than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study at Emory University in Atlanta found that both
depressed mothers and their babies have increased amounts of the
hormone cortisol in their blood, an indication of stress.
</P>
<P>
   Such high levels can make these infants vulnerable to
overreacting to stress later in life.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a depressed mother is more likely to withdraw from
her baby, reducing the amount of positive interaction between the
two, Possner said. Such interaction is important for the baby's
overall development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more serious than a lot of things that obstetricians
take care of during pregnancy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem with postpartum depression has been
diagnosing it. Women with the problem are often the last ones to
admit something is wrong, because of fear and shame.
</P>
<P>
   Possner and researchers at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y.,
are studying ways to help predict, before the birth, which women
might be most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Postpartum depression is almost always treatable with
medications and psychotherapy,'' said Karen Williams, an associate
professor of biology and the Health Professions Counselor at Union
College. ``There's no reason for people to suffer through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue Woman's Hospital has been participating in the research
by distributing the questionnaire to women before and after they
have their babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a psychic PAP test,'' Possner said, referring to
the common screening test for cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe women without the support of close family or
friends are often most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts say that women with a personal or family history
of depression are more likely to experience it. And women who have
had postpartum depression in an earlier pregnancy also are at
greater risk in subsequent births.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the level of depression, a combination of
medication and therapy may be recommended. Most women who are
prescribed medication, which requires them to stop breast-feeding,
see improvement in three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Possner believes one simple question can help gauge the
well-being of any new mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite question is, `Are you happy?''' he said. ``That's
a shocker to most ladies. If there's a sudden blank pause and they
break into tears, you've got a problem.''

<P>
   KOSOVO-KLA _ STARIE KACANEK, Kosovo _ The KLA flexes its mucle.
Hundreds of Serb civilians, fearing for their lives, fled this town
Tuesday after it was taken over by Kosovo Liberation Army rebels
who discovered a mass grave. The KLA fighters, angered by
eyewitness accounts of how Serb soldiers had executed Kosovar
residents, began firing their weapons in the air and ordered the
Serb residents to leave. About 30 carloads of Serbs soon fled. It
may be the first documented case of ethnic cleansing by ethnic
Albanians and illustrates the difficulty NATO peacekeepers will
have in preventing acts of revenge. And for the first time in a
year, KLA commander Drini was able to come into town, have coffe
and along the way declare that this is the first city that the KLA
controls ``100 percent.'' He said the KLA will cooperate with the
Military-Technical Agreement but are not prepared de-militarize.
The German NATO commanders in the area say that they are not going
to crack down on the rebel fighters at this point.

park bench. In a region that saw the worst of the Serb ethnic
cleansing campaign, the efficiency of that campaign in Pec is

near their refugee camp. Now, instead of planning a return to his
homeland, Emini lies under a mound of dirt on a plateau with 140
other deceased ethnic Albanians who fled Kosovo during the Serbs'
ethnic cleansing campaign. In a new section the local city
cemetery, their graves show the signs of a people dispossessed.

charge doomed the 33-year-old immigrant's plans. He's spent the
last 20 months at Krome Detention Center near Miami as a criminally
tainted immigrant, awaiting deportation. Richardson's luck could be
changing. Converging in his favor are a growing dissent over the
1996 immigration law and a favorable June 1 ruling by the U.S.

   BLACK-FARMERS _ PAHOKEE, Fla. _ Being a small farmer is hard and
being a small black farmer is nearly impossible. When a crop is
lost, credit is the only way to survive and credit can be hard to
come by. Black farmers for years have struggled with the USDA,
their government loans delayed past planting time or inexplicably
rejected. At last count in 1997, only 18,000 of America's 1.9
million farms were owned by blacks. Over the years, as small farms
collapsed under the weight of competition from mega growers, black
farms perished at nearly twice the rate of white farms. Black
farmers understood why it was so difficult. But it wasn't until
April that the rest of the world learned: A federal class-action
lawsuit initiated by a third generation North Carolina farmer
against the USDA was settled for an estimated $2.25 billion, the
largest civil rights settlement in history Farmers are now
beginning to file claims. (Staletovich, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   FLA-SUPERBOWL-MONEY _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For their $210,000
to the last two Super Bowls played in South Florida, Palm Beach
officials expect the National Football League to show the same
gratitude it did in Broward and Miami-Dade counties: a $1 million
contribution toward a new youth center. That would be something
real they could point to as they decide whether to continue
donating in the face of doubts about whether Palm Beach County's
investment is worth it. (Gelbart, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

COLLEGE CLASS TO FOCUS ON DEALING WITH DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Subs complete text)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After years of learning about death and dying
through their work with hospice patients, two women are developing
a college curriculum leading to a certificate in bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-credit certification program at Maria College in Albany,
which recently received approval by the New York Education
Department, will begin in the fall. It is aimed at health-care
professionals, educators and others seeking to work in the field of
bereavement services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've received so many lessons and blessings from hospice
patients and their families that we decided it was time to share
some of that knowledge through this forum,'' said Sister Jean
Roche, a coordinator of the certificate program and the newly named
campus minister at Maria College.
</P>
<P>
   Roche, 60, spent 17 years as chaplain at the Community Hospice
inn at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany before a debilitating bout of
rheumatoid arthritis forced her to retire abruptly a year ago. She
returned to work after successful medical treatment and a spiritual
sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was medicine, mystery and miracle,'' Roche said. ``My
doctor said I'm one of the lucky ones to have made a full recovery.
Personally, the past year was a chance for me to grieve over the
thousands of hospice patients and families I'd worked with over the
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Roche is known for creative methods of helping terminally ill
patients share their feelings about dying, including journal
writing; rituals with candles, incense and water; healing touch;
prayer and meditation through music; and devising personalized
memorial services.
</P>
<P>
   Roche created the new bereavement program with Eileen Clinton,
44, of Troy, N.Y., who spent eight years as bereavement coordinator
at Community Hospice. Clinton left that job to care for her mother,
Florence Clinton, who suffered from kidney failure and died last
year at 81.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so grateful to share the final year of my mother's life
with her,'' Clinton said. ``I learned so much by being her
caregiver and practicing what I had preached at hospice for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Roche's relationship predates their time together at
hospice; Roche was Clinton's English teacher at Catholic Central
High School in Troy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how our paths have crossed and recrossed. We're
kindred spirits and we've been each other's teachers in many
ways,'' Roche said.
</P>
<P>
   Roche and Clinton found a receptive ear for the bereavement
certificate proposal with Maria College administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the time is right for this kind of program,'' said
Sister Laureen Fitzgerald, president of Maria College. ``Our
population is aging and as a society we're trying to come to terms
with recent incidents of school violence. We need to learn new ways
of coping with grief and loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria College has about 850 full- and part-time students and is
a two-year institution offering associate's degrees. Fitzgerald
said the bereavement courses will enhance the training of Maria
students in nursing, occupational therapy and physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Maria College was founded by the Sisters of Mercy, the religious
order to which Roche belongs, and the school is located adjacent to
hospice offices at St. Peter's Hospital where both Roche and
Clinton worked for years.
</P>
<P>
   Roche and Clinton, both of whom will teach courses, have
enlisted current and former hospice staff members as instructors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to make this program an oasis to reflect on grief and
loss in a way that our fast-paced society doesn't always allow,''
Roche said.
</P>
<P>
   The program will offer courses on spirituality and ritual,
support groups, children and death, care of the caregiver,
assisting grieving families, disenfranchised grief and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   The classes will involve an experiential learning approach and
will include discussions with terminally ill patients and their
families and visits to funeral homes and memorial services. The
cost of the courses, which will be available nights and weekends,
are $200 per credit hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing together a blend of talented teachers,''
Clinton said. ``There's a hunger in the community to learn about
and to talk openly about death.''
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the National Hospice Foundation found that
adult Americans are uncomfortable talking about death and reluctant
to ask elderly parents about their wishes regarding care in life's
final stages.
</P>
<P>
   One out of four Americans over the age of 45 surveyed said they
would not bring up issues related to their parent's death, even if
the parent had a terminal illness and less than six months to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time we started talking,'' said Karen A. Davie, president
of the National Hospice Foundation in Arlington, Va. She said baby
boomers and their elderly parents are experiencing a communications
breakdown when it comes to discussing death.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are nearly 40 million senior citizens in the
United States, but that number is expected to double in the next
three decades as baby boomers reach age 65. Each year, more than 70
percent of the 2.3 million people who die in America are faced with
difficult end-of-life care decisions, often without adequate early
discussion about options.

Over 78 days, NATO warplanes flew 35,000 sorties, dropped 23,000
bombs, destroyed 1,500 targets and shattered the backbone of a
central European military force _ all without losing a single U.S.
or allied pilot in combat. But the campaign has raised questions
and sparked debate whether air power alone can win a war without
the use of ground troops. (Includes 3-column color photo of a jet

   UNEXPLORED LANDS: It's true that explorers have reached the
world's highest mountain (Everest, 29,029 feet) and the deepest
ocean (Mariana Trench, in the Pacific, 35,797 feet). And this might
suggest that the Earth is all explored. But at the dawn of a new
millennium, it's amazing to learn that some parts of the world
still haven't been charted. What are the unexplored places and why
hasn't anyone reached them yet? (Includes a 4-column color map

   KOSOVO AIR: There has never been an air campaign quite like it.
Over 78 days, NATO warplanes flew 35,000 sorties, dropped 23,000
bombs, destroyed 1,500 targets and shattered the backbone of a
central European military force _ all without losing a single U.S.
or allied pilot in combat. But the campaign has raised questions
and sparked debate whether air power alone can win a war without
the use of ground troops. (Includes 3-column color photo of a jet
fighter leaving the flight deck of a carrier, a 2-column photo of

   TRAFFIC: Are we there yet? Experts say that vacation trip _ hey,
cut that out! _ may take a little longer this summer thanks to the
$3 billion in highway improvements Congress passed last year. In
fact, expect construction every 40 miles or so. Besides danger _ a
lot of rear end accidents when cars suddenly slow down and highway
workers run over _ it's going to be quite an inconvenience since
lower gasoline prices are expected to boost travel. We check
construction in Missouri and Kansas and major interstates in the
region to localize so the traveling consumer knows what to expect.

into soups and pasta dishes, or filled with stuffings like cheese
and anchovies, or simply dipped into a light batter and fried. The
blossoms have a subtle flavor and a wildly beautiful shape, which

WINE OF THE WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gewuerztraminer Herrenweg Turckheim 1996, Zind-Humbrecht,
Alsace, France. About $29.
</P>
<P>
   A cool late summer and early fall in 1996 resulted in unusually
high acidity in many Alsatian wines. For producers who make leaner,
drier wines, this could be a problem, but I must admit I actually
enjoyed the touch of sharpness in this gewuerztraminer.
</P>
<P>
   The Humbrechts make some of the richest, most intense white
wines in the world, many of them truly masterpieces. But their
fullness and power can at times be almost overwhelming. They are
wines to sip slowly and wonder at.
</P>
<P>
   This gewuerztraminer has all the fruit and concentrated bouquet
one expects from Zind-Humbrecht, but with an added jolt of
freshness that makes it almost irresistible. The higher acidity
should help the wine age well.  &QL;

THAI-STYLE BEEF SALAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wonderful mesclun that is sold at some farm stands and green
markets contains a variety of flavorful baby greens _ herbs, kale,
dandelion, arugula, beet, turnip, mustard _ that have the potential
for becoming a salad of great complexity.
</P>
<P>
   The mesclun that is sold in almost every food store these days,
however, is less ideal, as it is essentially just small-to-medium
lettuce leaves, maybe with some radicchio or escarole thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't take much to turn supermarket mesclun into a
wonderful salad: simply toss it with a handful of flavorful, mild
herbs, like parsley or mint. I find that mint, especially, gives
this salad a Southeast Asian flavor.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of some grilled steak _ chicken, pork or
shrimp does nicely, too _ the salad can become a meal. Since steak
doesn't need any seasoning, cooking it takes only 10 minutes. You
can, of course, also roast the steak in the oven in your kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   I make a light but assertive vinaigrette, based not on olive oil
but on a neutral-flavored oil like canola. I use relatively little
oil, since its job is only to help the remaining dressing
ingredients coat the greens. To this I add rice vinegar or lime
juice, both of which are high in flavor but low in acidity. The
vinaigrette is rounded off with mustard, shallots, and nam pla
(Thai fish sauce) or soy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   MINTY THAI-STYLE BEEF SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 to 1{ pounds thick sirloin, rib-eye or other boneless steak
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 cups mesclun greens
</P>
<P>
   1 cup mint leaves
</P>
<P>
   \ cup neutral oil, like canola
</P>
<P>
   \ cup rice vinegar or lime juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon mustard, optional
</P>
<P>
   1 chopped shallot, about 1 tablespoon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons nam pla, or 1 tablespoon soy sauce mixed with 1
tablespoon water
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon or more freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. If you're grilling, start a charcoal fire or preheat a gas
grill. Grill steak about 4 minutes a side for medium rare. (If
you're cooking inside, preheat oven to its maximum, 450 to 500
degrees. Heat ovenproof skillet on stove over high heat until it
smokes. Place steak in skillet, and transfer to oven. Roast about 4
minutes a side for medium rare.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, wash greens and toss with mint. Whisk or blend
remaining ingredients together, taste, and adjust seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   3. Let steak rest for a minute before slicing, and then place it
atop greens, with its juices. Dress with vinaigrette, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Variations: Use cilantro or Thai basil instead of mint, or
combine a bit of these with the mint. Parsley, chervil, Italian
basil or dill, separately or in combination to taste, also work
well. With this last group of herbs, prepare a more standard
vinaigrette, which will give this salad a European character.
Combine 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil with about 1/3 cup lemon
juice and the mustard and minced shallot.

SAUTEED SKATE WITH EGGPLANT CHUTNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   This is the fourth of eight columns by Thomas Keller, the chef and
owner of the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif. His collaborator
is Michael Ruhlman.  
(jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Skate is all about visual impact and texture. I love its dense,
ropy flesh. It has a wonderful bite and flavor _ not as mild as
sole but rather flavorful and meaty like monkfish. And it is also
easy to cook.
</P>
<P>
   The fish is not so delicate that it falls apart at high
temperatures, so the exterior becomes deliciously crisp. Its
tolerance for heat is also high. Unlike cod or salmon, which will
quickly overcook, skate will hit the right point of doneness and
stay there. I use Atlantic spotted skate because it is a little
smaller than other types and its ropes are more compact.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, fish is my favorite protein to work with because of
the extraordinary variety of textures and flavors available. Most
people know the basics of buying and storing fish, but please
remember how delicate it is and handle it gently. When you cook it,
turn it with a spatula or palate knife, never with tongs.
</P>
<P>
   (In my restaurant, I don't allow my line brigade to use tongs
for anything because tongs so easily damage the food.)
</P>
<P>
   Fish is also exciting to work with because it is such a great
vehicle for garnishes. Think of fish as a pedestal for other
flavors. This chutney is an excellent concoction in itself; it
would go well with sole or chicken, or you can stuff zucchini with
it and roast it for a vegetarian dish.
</P>
<P>
   But here it provides a perfect example of how fish magnifies the
complex flavors in the garnish, which combines strong spices
(curry, cinnamon, clove), acids (wine and citrus juices) and sugars
(granulated and in the sweet vegetables).
</P>
<P>
   And it shows how these flavor components in turn enhance the
fish. I call the preparation a chutney because of the sweet-sour
elements, but if you look closely, you'll notice that it is really
a ratatouille in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   I have looked no further than a Provencal combination of
vegetables _ eggplant, zucchini, squash, bell peppers _ because it
is summer and these vegetables are excellent and abundant.
</P>
<P>
   SAUTEED SKATE WITH EGGPLANT CHUTNEY  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 25 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds skate wing, trimmed of cartilage and red areas
</P>
<P>
   Canola oil
</P>
<P>
   Flour
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Eggplant chutney (see recipe).
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut skate into six rectangular portions, 3 by 4 inches, about
3 ounces each. The actual size of the pieces will depend on the
thickness and size of the skate wing. If the piece of fish is very
thin, cut a larger piece and fold it over.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a large saute pan over medium heat, add canola oil to a
depth of [ inch. While oil is heating, lightly dust each portion of
skate with flour, patting off any excess. Season with salt to
taste.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place skate in hot oil, and saute, basting occasionally with
oil, until fish is golden brown on bottom, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn
fillets, and continue to saute until fish is opaque and fully
cooked, another minute or two.
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, divide eggplant chutney among six plates. Top each
with a portion of skate.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   EGGPLANT CHUTNEY  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon curry powder
</P>
<P>
   1 1-inch piece cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   1 clove
</P>
<P>
   2 2-inch strips orange zest
</P>
<P>
   2 2-inch strips lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   \ cup minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   1 cup peeled, seeded, finely chopped tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   { cup red wine
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons orange juice
</P>
<P>
   3 cups finely diced eggplant
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups finely diced zucchini
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups finely diced yellow squash
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into several pieces
</P>
<P>
   \ cup finely diced roasted red peppers
</P>
<P>
   \ cup finely diced roasted yellow peppers
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a small skillet, combine curry powder, cinnamon stick and
clove. Place over medium heat, and toast to eliminate widowthe
spices until they give off an aroma. Remove from the heat, and wrap
in cheesecloth with the orange zest and the lemon zest. Tie the
cheesecloth to make a sachet.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a medium saucepan, combine 2 tablespoons of the olive oil
and the shallots. Place over low heat, and saute until the shallots
have softened, about 4 minutes. Add tomatoes, red wine, sugar,
lemon and orange juice, and sachet. Simmer until liquid has reduced
and texture resembles marmalade, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from
heat, and discard sachet.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons olive
oil. Add eggplant, and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain
on paper towels. Return the skillet to medium heat, and add 2 more
tablespoons of the oil. Add zucchini and yellow squash, and saute
until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. (Chutney may
be prepared to this point several hours in advance.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Reheat tomato mixture, and whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons
olive oil. Add butter one piece at a time, whisking to emulsify the
sauce. Add sauteed eggplant, zucchini and yellow squash, and mix
well. Fold in red peppers, yellow peppers and parsley. Season with
salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 cups.  &QL;

THE MANY FACES OF CABERNET FRANC 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHINON, France _ In their hearts, all Frenchmen truly believe
the old axiom that insists ``a wine's first duty is to be red.''
And yet there are parts of France where red wine definitely plays
second fiddle. Champagne, of course, and Alsace, where riesling and
gewuerztraminer reign supreme.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Loire Valley, the great garden of France,
where chenin blanc is king and all the other grapes its vassals.
Except one _ cabernet franc, a red grape. If chenin is king,
cabernet franc is queen.
</P>
<P>
   It is primarily grown in the Chinon region, in Bourgueil and
Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil, and it's important in Saumur-Champigny
and Anjou. Chinon reds are among the most popular reds in Paris; it
is mostly to quench the capital's thirst that the plantings of
cabernet franc around Chinon have tripled in the last 25 years,
from 1,500 acres to 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cabernet franc is also an important component of the best wines
of Bordeaux. At some famous Bordeaux chateaus, like Cheval-Blanc,
in St.-Emilion, it is the principal ingredient. Napa Valley
winemakers, looking for tannins and structure, regularly blend
cabernet franc with cabernet sauvignon. The North Fork of Long
Island has also proved to be a friendly venue for the grape. But
attempting to detect a family tie between a young Chinon and a
California cabernet franc would be tough even for an expert.
</P>
<P>
   The cabernet franc grape arrived in the Loire Valley over a
thousand years ago. Locally, it is often called Breton, possibly
because it came through Brittany to get to the central Loire
Valley. Although some historians trace it back to an Abbe Breton
who grew it in his gardens, Jacqueline Friedrich, an authority on
the Loire, says Francois Rabelais, the 16th-century writer who was
born near Chinon, wrote of ``the good wine of Breton'' 200 years
before the abbot came on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, cabernet franc has spent the outgoing millennium
adapting to the local soil and climate, so it should be no surprise
that it performs differently elsewhere. Along the Loire, local
growers say there are really two Chinons, one from cabernet franc
grown on gravelly soil near the riverbanks and one grown on chalk
and clay up the slopes from the river. The first is the light,
fruity wine drunk in Paris bistros when it's a year old. The latter
is a bigger, more complex wine that will age well for many years.
</P>
<P>
   How many years depends on the grower and on the specific terroir
he cultivates. Terroir is that elusive French word that encompasses
the site and the weather _ the vineyard's complete ecosystem _ and
agriculture's impact on the place over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The wine known as Chinon is produced in Chinon, of course, and
in 18 other contiguous communes that make up a zone between the
Loire and the little Vienne River, eastward from the spot where the
two rivers meet near Chinon. A typical local grower will own or
rent parcels of land all over the Chinon appellation and will make
two or three different styles of Chinon.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bernard Baudry at Cravant makes a light, easily
drinkable version; a second version made from old vines but not
aged in wood, and a third made from old vines and aged in oak. Some
growers age their best wines for two or three years, then recommend
that they be matured in the bottle for another three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known producer of Chinon is Charles Joguet. Joguet, an
artist who works in his Paris atelier during the week, is known not
only for the quality of his wines but for the variety of his
offerings. They include young wines like the Cuvee Jeunes Vignes,
blended from grapes from various plots, and complex single-vineyard
wines like his Varennes du Grand Clos, from 25-year-old vines, and
his Clos de la Dioterie, from 90-year-old vines.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I sampled the 1996 Clos de la Dioterie at Jean Bardet,
the two-star restaurant in Tours. It was too young, but for someone
only vaguely familiar with the best Chinon, it was a revelation.
There was a wholly unreasonable urge to say, ``Let's try five or 10
other vintages; this is a remarkable wine.''
</P>
<P>
   The strongest impression from the wine is fruit, but not the
fresh fruits of summer, as in the young Chinon. Rather, the taste
is more of fruit jams and spices.
</P>
<P>
   I like Ms. Friedrich's description in her book, ``A Wine and
Food Guide to the Loire'' (Henry Holt, 1996): ``I often think of
old Bretons as the embodiment of memory _ not of a specific memory,
but of memory itself. I have an image of an old handkerchief made
of fine cloth softened after years of being folded into purses,
still carrying whiffs of many exquisite perfumes, mingled, muted
and fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of moderately priced Chinon to choose from in
the major wine markets in the United States, where it has to
compete, of course, with merlot, the current favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Cabernet franc, California cabernet franc, is leaner, more
tannic and less accessible. French cabernet franc, as expressed in
Chinon and other Loire reds, is a different wine altogether. Like
any truly interesting friend, it takes time to get to know.

`FISH': ENGLISH DISHES THAT DISPEL ENNUI 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm tired of gorgeous picture books that call for my very own
kitchen staff before I can even get to the stove. I'm bored with
over-the-top fusion cooking fatefully headed in the direction that
spelled the decline of nouvelle cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   But after trying three recipes from ``Fish'' by Sophie Grigson
and William Black (Headline Book Publishing, London, 1998), I have
lost my cooking ennui. Ms. Grigson has produced bright, fresh
dishes with a modern sensibility that illustrate why London is one
of the hottest eating towns in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grigson has not discarded what was good about British
cooking _ potted shrimp, the Anglo-Indian kedgeree, fried whitebait
and marinated kippers. But she has added the occasional modern
touch, like cayenne to make the whitebait spicy and peas to give a
sweet note to the kedgeree. She has also borrowed judiciously from
other cuisines to produce a collection of dishes to please a
reasonably competent cook.
</P>
<P>
   I say reasonably competent because ``Fish,'' unlike many
American cookbooks that spell out everything, expects cooks to use
their judgment. As the author comments in the headnotes for salsa
verde: ``The quantities sound vague _ how big is a bunch of
parsley? _ but that is in the nature of the sauce. Variations
abound, and the key is to taste and play with the balance of
flavors until it pleases you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nach Waxman, the owner of Kitchen Arts and Letters in New York,
has tipped off his customers to this book. ``Our customers are
interested in what is happening, what kind of innovative thinking
there is in the field, what other professionals are thinking, new
ideas, new approaches,'' he said, ``and what they are more
stimulated by is this very fresh bunch of people who are working in
London and Sydney and Melbourne. What blows me away is that they
are home-grown, even though they are from countries that had very
paltry culinary traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grigson had good home-grown training: she is the daughter of
the late, great cookbook author Jane Grigson, who wrote ``Fish
Cookery'' in 1973 (it included a recipe for halibut with Welsh
rarebit crust that she served her family; Sophie Grigson reprints
it). She also roams the world, adding lemongrass to a bright
octopus salad from Thailand, star anise from China to a plum
compote served with seared sea bass, and creme fraiche from France
to just about everything else.
</P>
<P>
   William Black, Ms. Grigson's husband, provides instructions for
buying and storing fish and information about the severe problems
of overfishing and the indiscriminate use of antibiotics. Each
recipe also provides alternative species, which is helpful not only
when an American is working with an English cookbook, but also when
the fishmonger doesn't have a particular fish.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing's perfect, though. If the book is going to include a
recipe for Manhattan clam chowder, there must be one for the New
England version. That's an unfortunate omission but hardly in
league with the suggestion that frozen soft-shell crabs are
acceptable. For a book that emphasizes the primary importance of
fish quality, shame, shame.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has not yet been published in the United States, the
book is available at www.amazon.co.uk for $26 plus $8 shipping. It
can also be ordered from Kitchen Arts and Letters, 1435 Lexington
Ave., New York, N.Y., (212-876-5550), for $55.

   BAKED FILLETS WITH CREME FRAICHE, CHERRY TOMATOES AND PARMESAN
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Fish'' by Sophie Grigson and William Black &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds skinless brill, John Dory, turbot, bass, sole, hake,
pollock or cod fillets
</P>
<P>
   Salt and white pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   5 ounces cherry tomatoes, washed and halved
</P>
<P>
   7 ounces creme fraiche
</P>
<P>
   8 large basil leaves, shredded
</P>

<P>
   2. Use half the butter to grease a baking dish large enough to
hold the fillets in a single, snug layer. Lay the fillets in it.
</P>
<P>
   3. Dot the cherry tomato halves over them. Smear the creme
fraiche over the fish and tomatoes, covering the fish more or less
evenly. Scatter the basil over, and then sprinkle the cheese evenly
over the top. Grind a little more pepper over the whole thing, and
dot with the remaining butter.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bake 15 minutes, until the fish is just cooked through. Serve
bubbling and sizzling. Yield: 4 servings.

CAT LOVERS OPEN INN FOR FELINES ON THE GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BETSY FELDSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEENSBURY, N.Y. _ Cat owners who don't want to consign their
beloved kitty to a standard-issue kennel can take their feline
friends to a ``cat bed and breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Kip and Jean Grant of Queensbury, owners of four cats, designed
the Country Kitty B&AMP;B to provide ``an affordable alternative for
cat owners who must decide how and where to care for their pets
while they're away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   After almost 30 years of caring for family and stray cats, the
Grants decided a year ago to get into the business.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the boarding facility came when one of the Grants'
own cats required a brief stay at the veterinarian. According to
Jean Grant, ``This was her first time in a cage, and we could tell
it was very stressful for her. We wanted to create an alternative
for folks who prefer not to board their cat in a cage or depend on
a friend or relative to `cat sit.'''
</P>
<P>
   The boarding facility for cats is located next to their home in
upstate New York. Cost of the facility was about $130,000. The
Grants invested about $15,000 for furnishings and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 10 guest rooms, which measure 45 square feet, is
named after one of the Grants' past or present cats. They include a
large window and seat, cubbies for playing hide and seek, plush
beds, cat chairs, toys, private litter boxes and plenty of food and
water.
</P>
<P>
   When finished, each room will be furnished with one vinyl
lawnchair covered by fabric with cat designs, and one or two cat
beds. Cat-themed wallpaper will decorate each room's walls, and
linoleum covers the floors. Cats may catch their reflection on door
mirrors in each room. Up to three cats from the same household may
rest comfortably in one room. Baths and grooming are available and
arrangements can be made for special diet and health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In order to make the felines even more comfortable, temperature
control is planned for each room. For the cats' pleasure, music
will be piped into the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The ``inn's'' reception area offers a ``Kitty Corner,'' filled
with books containing both cat stories and cat care. An office and
a small kitchen complete the facility. A typical daily schedule
includes breakfast served at 8 a.m., dinner at 5 p.m. and bedtime
at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Grant said a family may bring in its own food for cats.
Playtime and catnaps are offered to the feline guests throughout
the day. Cats who enjoy being outdoors may be taken for a stroll,
weather permitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guest fees'' at the Country Kitty B&AMP;B are $12 daily and $10
per day for a week's stay. Discounts on the daily rate are offered
for each additional feline guest.
</P>
<P>
   The Country Kitty B&AMP;B is not alone. Cat's Pajamas Inn, in Salem,
Mass., offers 18 ``townhomes'' that look like tall cabinets with
four levels. The inn has a country garden theme with little garden
areas for cats.

`HANNIBAL' IS A SAVORY SEQUEL FOR HARRIS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (note: Chateau d'Yquem is cq; add circumflex over first ``a'' in
Chateau) 
 
By FRITZ LANHAM 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The iron law of sequels, in books or movies, boils down to this:
To succeed, they must exceed.
</P>
<P>
   If the previous book was violent, the sequel must be even more
violent. If the previous book had a bad guy, the sequel should have
a viler villain _ or better yet, two.
</P>
<P>
   If cannibalism, say, was a motif in the predecessor, then the
new book ought to render a weakness for the flesh in even more
flamboyant, exquisitely imagined ways: Pop the cork on that Chateau
d'Yquem! Let loose the pigs!
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Harris could be the poster boy for the law of sequel
success. ``Hannibal'' (Delacorte Press, $27.95), the just-released
continuation of his best-selling 1988 ``Silence of the Lambs''
(itself a sequel to the 1981 ``Red Dragon''), fairly bursts with
lurid violence and sleek, brainy bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in an appealing heroine _ FBI agent Clarice Starling,
reprising her role in ``Lambs'' _ a thick dollop of pop Freudianism
and at least one daring plot twist, and you have the stuff of
superior entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   None of it is particularly plausible, of course, but Harris
paces the action well, and his villains are engaging in a
larger-than-life way.
</P>
<P>
   As the title suggests, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the serial murderer
with a penchant for consuming his victims, takes center stage in
this book, although he must share it with Starling and a third
figure, Mason Verger, one of Lecter's early victims.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is seven years after the end of ``Lambs,'' which saw
Lecter escape from custody and flee to South America. There, an
apparently limitless supply of money and the offices of a fine
plastic surgeon have given him a new life.
</P>
<P>
   As this novel opens, Lecter has moved on to Florence, Italy,
where he has turned himself into an expert on Tuscan literature and
is living the life of a retiring but painfully cultivated
gentleman-scholar.
</P>
<P>
   He drinks the finest wines, wears the most elegant suits, amuses
himself by playing Bach's ``Goldberg Variations'' on his antique
clavier. Lecter is quite the dandy.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the novel, Harris flashes back to Lecter's childhood,
to events that ostensibly explain his psychopathologies.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, this psychologizing and the attention to domestic
detail tend to diminish Lecter as a villain. In ``Lambs'' he was an
elemental force of evil, beyond comprehension, beyond humanity.
Here he falls into a more familiar category _ the filthy rich,
super-intelligent, seemingly infallible evildoer. More like Dr.
Moriarty, or some of those cartoon baddies in the James Bond
movies.
</P>
<P>
   But in this novel Hannibal is more quarry than hunter. Weighing
almost as heavy on the scale of villainy is Verger, child molester,
scion of a meat-packing fortune and a man nursing a serious grudge
against the good doctor.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Verger was a patient of Lecter. One thing led to
another, and now Verger lies paralyzed from the neck down.
Moreover, he won't be needing a shave for a while.
</P>
<P>
   But his brain is very much alive, and as he lies in a room at
Muskrat Farm, his northern Maryland estate, a giant eel his
principal companion, he's plotting a particularly nasty revenge.
Sardinian thugs and man-eating pigs figure into his scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Starling, the third main character, has seen her promising FBI
career flounder since ``Lambs.'' A combination of traditional
good-old-boy sexism and her own sometimes-abrasive manner has left
the 32-year-old agent adrift, with few allies.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening pages of the book, she participates in a botched
and bloody drug raid that leaves five bodies on a Washington, D.C.,
street, including that of a woman Starling shoots in self-defense.
With Justice Department Deputy Assistant Inspector General Paul
Krendler working against her behind the scenes, Starling's days in
the FBI seem numbered.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of the novel involves the competing searches for Lecter
by Starling and Verger.
</P>
<P>
   All three principals eventually come face to face (O.K., in
Verger's case ``face'' perhaps isn't the right word). The
Lecter-Verger scrimmage works out in fairly predictable fashion,
although Harris keeps the tension level high. ``Hannibal'' is
nothing if not a page-turner.
</P>
<P>
   The Starling-Lecter relationship is more problematic. In
``Lambs'' Harris allowed Lecter to probe Starling's painful
childhood _ the death of her beloved father, a low-level lawman
killed in the line of duty; her class insecurities; the trauma of
witnessing the deaths of horses and lambs as a foster child. A
dramatic tension flowed from the psychological duel between Lecter,
the doctor/daddy/evildoer, and Starling, the
patient/child/representative of moral order.
</P>
<P>
   In this novel, Harris works some surprising twists on this
complicated affair of attraction and repulsion. By the end of the
book, it's hard to know what we're supposed to think of Hannibal
the Cannibal.
</P>
<P>
   Harris works some well-drawn minor characters into the
narrative. Margot Verger, Mason Verger's body-builder lesbian
sister, is a study in frustration as she tries to persuade her
brother to donate semen so she can have a child with her lover.
</P>
<P>
   Even better is Barney, the hospital attendant who was in charge
of the incarcerated Lecter in ``Lambs.'' A man with just the
ordinary amount of larceny in his heart, Barney hires on with the
Vergers but ends up desperately searching for a way to extricate
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Harris' previous books _ who have been waiting 11 years
for this one _ won't be disappointed. ``Hannibal'' isn't great
literature, but it's gaudy fun.

 &HT;    ``Buena'' documentry revolves around music
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL FRIDAY, JUNE 18. DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN.
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're not already a fan of the crossover hit record, ``Buena
Vista Social Club,'' you might feel lost during the documentary
that bears the same name. Shot by German auteur Wim Wenders, the
movie follows musician Ry Cooder and his son Joachim back to Cuba,
where he rediscovered the near-forgotten musical artists of the
pre-Castro era.
</P>
<P>
   Low-key and almost defiantly shapeless, ``Social Club'' doesn't
bother to explain the genesis of the album until around the
75-minute mark. It spends its time shifting back-and-forth between
the faded, jalopy-clogged streets of Havana, and concert halls in
Amsterdam and New York, where the reinvigorated musicians
(including singers Ibrahim Ferrer and Omara Portuondo) fill the air
with their melancholy, sexy ballads.
</P>
<P>
   Their music saves the movie, which treats them less as
individuals than exotic, found objects. We never learn to what
extent these 70- and 80-something musicians, whose bare-bones homes
the filmmakers visit, profited from the Cooder album. When the
camera stops moving around long enough to learn a little bit about
the aged musicians, Wenders elicit only the most perfunctory
stories from them about how they got into the music biz. It's as if
he were more interested in his nifty digital camera than in the
people he aimed it at. (Wenders himself calls the movie a
``musicmentary,'' maybe to dodge responsibility for the ways
``Social Club'' fails as a documentary.)
</P>
<P>
   If you're a fan of the album, you'll enjoy seeing the artists in
action. If you're new to the ``Buena Vista'' phenomenon, spend your
money on the album.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buena Vista Social Club''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by Wim Wenders. Rated G. One hour, 41 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Go for the music, but don't expect to learn much
about the musicians.

 &HT;    Romantic fantasy awkward but gleams with promise
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL FRIDAY, JUNE 18. DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN.)
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The romantic fantasy ``Twice Upon a Yesterday'' starts out with
flat-footed awkwardness but gradually grows deeper, nimbler. Its
ideas about love and destiny gleam with promise, even if the movie
never quite finds the structure to show them off properly. It's a
near-miss.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Henshall plays Victor, a wreck of a London actor pining
for the girlfriend he lost a year ago. That's when Sylvia (Lena
Headey) found out about his fling with an actress, and quickly
tumbled into love with a man she's met at her health club, David
(Mark Strong).
</P>
<P>
   The night before the new couple is to wed, Victor ties one on
and stumbles into two magical Spanish garbage collectors (don't
ask). These would-be whimsical wizards are a jarring element, as is
Elizabeth McGovern, playing a bartender who lends Victor a heavily
symbolic umbrella. These ``magic'' characters stick out awkwardly;
the screenplay, by Rafa Russo, is like a promising stew full of
oddly-flavored lumps like this.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the garbage guys send Victor back in time to save his
relationship with Sylvia. It's hard to care at first, since Victor
(played by the bug-eyed, sweaty Henshall) doesn't seem to rate a
second chance. But as he glows with joy at having Sylvia again _
and schemes to keep her from encountering Mark at the health club _
his scruffy-puppy charm expands.
</P>
<P>
   Here's when the movie finds its most interesting theme: What if,
even with the help of magic and foresight, you discovered that love
follows its own, unpredictable rules of destiny? ``Twice'' becomes
much more lively as Sylvia becomes an active character in the
drama, and Penelope Cruz (``Open Your Eyes'') turns up as the
world's most luscious bartender. You can almost forgive director
Maria Ripoll for letting the garbagemen reappear in the last scene.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice Upon a Yesterday''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C +
</P>
<P>
   Starring Douglas Henshall, Lena Headey. Rated R for language and
a scene of sexuality. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An awkward but sometimes appealing fantasy about
the vagaries of love.

HYDE ATTACKS FIRST AMENDMENT AND PARENTAL AUTHORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Repeating for all needing)  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper, Wyo., Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
(mk) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who failed to lead his GOP cohorts to a
conviction of President Clinton on any articles of impeachment, is
now leading a charge against parents and the First Amendment. Let
us hope he has the same measure of success with this ill-conceived
effort.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, Hyde, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee,
introduced the ``Children's Defense Act of 1999''(H.R. 2036), a
bill with such broad language that newspaper carriers under 17
years of age (defined as minors in the bill) may be forbidden to
read the newspapers they carry.
</P>
<P>
   And the newspaper company that puts a newspaper into the hands
of minors may be fined _ if that newspaper contains ``detailed
verbal descriptions or narrative accounts of explicit sexual or
violent material.'' How does one cover a war without such violent
details, or report on the horrors of genocide without such
descriptions?
</P>
<P>
   The bill does not spell out the amount of the fine, but anyone
convicted of allowing a minor to read Stephen Crane's ``Red Badge
of Courage'' or letting a 16-year-old see the move ``Schindler's
List'' could be imprisoned for five years and fined. Yes, these
powerful tales of war and the Holocaust also fall under the
material prohibited to minors by Hyde's bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill defines violent material as ``sadistic or masochistic
activity, including flagellation or torture by or upon a person,
acts of mutilation of the human body, or rape.'' That covers just
about all the inhumane acts that occur during war or are
perpetrated by dictatorial regimes. Shall we then hide these truths
from our 16-year-olds, when two years later, they could be faced
with fighting on some distant shore?
</P>
<P>
   Shall we keep them naive about the horrors of war, the violence
in inner cities, the history of genocide, the despicable acts of
torture done in dictatorships around the world?
</P>
<P>
   The material forbidden includes ``any picture, photograph,
drawing, sculpture, videogame, motion picture film, or similar
visual representation or image, book, pamphlet, magazine, printed
matter, or sound recording.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill uses a three-prong test to determine what sexual or
violent material is prohibited. If taken as a whole, the material
``1) predominantly appeals to the prurient, shameful, or morbid
interests of minors; 2) is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is
suitable material for minors; and 3) is utterly without redeeming
social importance for minors.''
</P>
<P>
   The language is vague. How does an adult know what is ``utterly
without redeeming social importance for minors''? A bookseller
might purge his store of the Greek tragedies, Greek mythology, the
medieval epic ``Beowulf,'' Dante's ``The Inferno,'' Richard
Wright's ``Native Son,'' John Gardner's ``Grendel,'' Erich Maria
Remarque's ``All Quiet on the Western Front'' _ to name only a few
that might fall victim to this legislation.
</P>
<P>
   This bill and others like it have been sparked by the school
shootings at Columbine High School. The aim of these bills is
misdirected and based upon false premise. H.R. 2036 claims that
``hundreds of studies have proven conclusively that children who
are consistently exposed to violence on television have a higher
tendency to exhibit violent and aggressive behavior, both as
children and later in life.'' No so.
</P>
<P>
   Social scientists who conduct such studies about violence have
arrived at differing and mixed results. A child's aggressive
behavior is more a result of drugs, alcohol and physical or sexual
abuse within a family.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have also shown that males who have just completed some
aerobic exercise and then are angered will show more aggressive
behavior than they would had they not exercised. Shall we then
criminalize aerobic exercise?
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council, an agency within the National
Academy of Sciences, did an exhaustive study on the causes of
violence and aggressive behavior in 1993 and did not consider the
media a significant problem. Truth is, some test subjects do
exhibit more aggressive behavior for a short period of time after
viewing a violent movie or TV show _ some, but not most.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if parents feel that TV is contributing to the
aggressive behavior of their children, the solution is simple. Turn
the thing off.
</P>
<P>
   Pull the plug. Lock all the TVs in a room or a closet. We don't
need the government telling us what we or our children
``should''view.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's bill gives no latitude for parents to decide what their
children should read or see or hear. The government will do that
for us. If parents show any of the prohibited material to their
children, they can be fined or imprisoned. There is no parental
exception built into this proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   We're beginning to see the price we pay when we think of the
government as the Santa who will give us all we wish. When we ask
the government to help us raise our children, it will. And it will
tell us what is prohibited and what is best. It will force its
rules and regulations between parents and child. ``Government knows
best'' is the new TV show, starring Henry Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   With all the problems in H.R. 2036, no wonder that the bill is
not scheduled to have any public hearings. Not a single one. Keep
the public out. Keep parents from knowing how the Congress will
structure their lives. The House Rules Committee is expected to
send the bill to the floor of the House this week for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time for members of the public to call their
representatives to object. Later will be too late. This bill is not
only an attack on the First Amendment right of free speech and
freedom of the press, it is also an assault on parental authority _
and the family itself.

now. (Includes 1 column color sig of columnist.)
</P>

<P>
   ANCIENT MAN: Humans, armed with cellular phones and laptop

YOUNG HEDONISTS GET `REAL' ON MTV 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know it'll be a good year on ``The Real World'' when you
feel an instant dislike for the vile youths onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Say (set ital)aloha(end ital) and settle in. Off with your
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Honolulu is home base for the perversely
entertaining MTV series. The debauchery begins Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes Teck, 22, by appearances a younger version of Dennis
Rodman. He's vanning to his new beachfront digs with one of his new
housemates, Ruthie, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthie was raised in a Hawaiian foster home by a strict Filipino
family, but she's got a curvy Polynesian look going.
</P>
<P>
   Teck approves. They've just met, and he's already got action in
mind. But wait. Ruthie's got a girlfriend. A (set ital)girl(end
ital)friend, man.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthie, on Teck: ``He's got some game. He won't get it from me,
but he'll get it.''
</P>
<P>
   So Teck settles for getting naked the moment he arrives at the
``Real World'' house. Ruthie, too. They're both judicious blurs as
they strip and leap giddily into the outdoor swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Teck and Ruthie are thus occupied when their five housemates
arrive one and two at a time. Teck is forever standing in the pool
to extend his hand, which apparently outdistances his other blurred
appendage.
</P>
<P>
   Newly arrived housemate Amaya, 21, a UCLA grad from Oakland,
Calif., drops her jaw. My God, he's standing naked in the pool. Not
the low Teck introduction she had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Matt, a 22-year-old Southern Californian, is noticing Ruthie,
not Teck. When it comes time to pick roommates, Matt says, ``I want
to sleep in Ruthie's room.'' And he does, along with Amaya.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of feels like I'm living on a page of National
Geographic,'' Matt observes, thinking of all the bare bodies around
him.
</P>
<P>
   Kaia, 22, is a Chicagoan and UC Berkeley student. She gives the
impression of strength and levelheadedness.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaia, too, has a philosophical problem with attire. She
seems to regard a pair of panties as overdressed. ``I really,
really like looking at myself,'' Kaia says. ``Call it narcissistic
if you want.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. It's narcissistic.
</P>
<P>
   Justin, 21, is the brains of this year's crew. He's taking time
off from Harvard Law to be on ``The Real World.'' Justin is also
gay.
</P>
<P>
   I do not dislike Justin. But Justin has some challenging months
ahead of him. His roomie is Colin, 19, another UC Berkeley student.
Colin's just a bit perplexed by this gay thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't mind if I sleep naked, do you?'' Colin asks Justin.
Colin will take the top bunk.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens Tuesday night. Oh, there's also the matter
of the ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as they're settled in, the cast goes out partying at a
nearby bar. Ruthie promptly drinks herself into a stupor. And what
a profound stupor it is _ eyes rolled back in her head, limbs
akimbo, brain shut down for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   They get her home, stand her up in the shower and tell her to
throw up. Then they call the ambulance. Whoosh, Ruthie's off to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, it's one more season of prime American youth.

VARIETY OF PLANTS AT HOME ON DUNES &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
(Undated) Q: What can I plant on the dunes and in the garden at my
beach home? &QL; 
_ J.P.M. &QR;
<P>
   A: James Webb, an associate professor in Texas A&AMP;M University's
marine biology department, recommends various grasses to help
stabilize sandy dunes. Three found on Texas Coast dunes that top
his list are bitter panic (Panicum amarum), a common dune grass
that matures to 2 or 3 feet in height; seashore dropseed
(Sporobolus virginicus), a Bermudalike grass that prefers the lower
front area of the dune, where it traps soil and allows the dune to
grow naturally; and marshhay cordgrass (Spartina patens), which
reaches a mature height of about 2 feet.
</P>
<P>
   These three grasses are available at the Texas A&AMP;M's commercial
nursery at 200 Seawolf Parkway on Pelican Island in the Galveston
area. Call 409-740-4542 for hours and information.
</P>
<P>
   The sporadic need of dune plants fluctuates and is heavily
influenced by storms that destroy the beachfront and dunes. This
sporadic need, in turn, affects availability of plants and, not
surprisingly, these plants can be difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one native perennial grass with ornamental
seedheads on Webb's dune list is sea oats (Uniola paniculata), but
this plant is not currently available at the nursery.
</P>
<P>
   Other stabilizing vegetation includes the sand-hugging sea
purslane (Sesuvium portulacastrum) and the goats-foot morning glory
(Ipomea pes-caprae), but, again, finding these commercially is
difficult. The goats-foot morning glory is a beach plant that binds
soil above tide levels. It is rather pretty with cloven-hooflike
6-inch foliage and 2-inch pink-purple flowers. This plant is mildly
poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   The beach evening primrose (Oenothera drummondii) is attractive
and useful on the dunes, as is Indian blanket (Gaillardia
pulchella), a familiar Texas wildflower. Large-leaf pennywort
(Hydrocotyle bonariensis), a perennial, has round, shiny green
foliage that hovers above the sand.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not have any of these plants on your dunes, perhaps
you have a neighbor with one or more who could share a start with
you. It is possible that local nurseries will have supplies of the
evening primrose and gaillardia at some time.
</P>
<P>
   A great number of plants, most of which are not difficult to
find in local nurseries, can grow behind the dunes where they are
afforded some protection from the constant and drying wind and salt
spray.
</P>
<P>
   You may need to modify the sandy soil somewhat to boost moisture
retention and nutrient supply. This can be easily done by amending
the sand with compost; use a layer of mulch in flower beds to help
modify soil temperature and encourage moisture retention.
</P>
<P>
   Windbreaks _ whether you rely on the dunes themselves, your
house or even large shrubs _ can increase gardening possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Plants that serve as windbreaks or simply as larger permanent
fixtures in the garden should be low-maintenance once established,
especially if they must survive with neglect when you are away from
your house for extended periods.
</P>
<P>
   Large, low-maintenance shrubs that serve as windbreaks or simply
as evergreens include:
</P>
<P>
   Chinese palms top out at about 6 feet and are widespreading.
</P>
<P>
   Coppertone loquat is an attractive medium-size tree/shrub cross
between a loquat and a hawthorn.
</P>
<P>
   Elaeagnus, a large, billowy shrub with silvery-green foliage and
tiny but fragrant fall blooms, is one of the easiest plants in any
garden.
</P>
<P>
   Ligustrum is a bushy, tall evergreen with glossy foliage and
white, fragrant spring flowers. It can be pruned up into a small
tree so that you can grow annuals and perennials beneath its
canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Oleanders (dwarf and standard) are island favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Pineapple guava is an underused large shrub/small tree that
matures to about 12 feet in height. The white blooms with red
stamens in spring are followed by fruit that can be used to make
jelly. Foliage has gray undersides.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler dwarf green pittosporum and variegated pittosporum are
also candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Wax myrtle, an easy, native evergreen, has dense, aromatic
foliage. Birds like the berries. Mature height is around 15 feet,
width is about 12 feet. This, too, can be pruned up into a small
tree. Dwarf cultivars also are available.
</P>
<P>
   A deciduous large plant/tree that should also grow at the beach
is the vitex _ a great ornamental tree that reaches 12 or 15 feet
in height. This easy-care plant has aromatic gray-green foliage and
produces purple spikes during the summer. Remove these for extended
blooms.
</P>
<P>
   The crape myrtle also grows on Galveston Island.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget that hibiscus _ hardy or tropical _ are excellent
seashore suggestions. These will provide high color. Or plumeria, a
drought-tolerant island plant with highly fragrant blooms used in
leis.
</P>
<P>
   The spring-fall flowering Cassia corymbosa produces yellow
flowers on plants that can reach 10 feet in height. Yellow bells
(Tecoma stans) produces showers of golden-yellow, tubular blooms,
on a deciduous plant that can be used as a shrub or small tree.
</P>
<P>
   Perennials that help bring color to the beach garden include:
daylilies; firecracker plants with orange-red tubular flowers that
attract nectar-lovers and expansive tufts of ferny, green foliage;
gaura, a native, with white flowers that resemble butterflies;
lantana; lazy daisy, which has small white flowers with yellow
centers that open around midday and is an excellent candidate for
sandy soil; pentas to attract butterflies; society garlic;
spiderwort; verbena; and wedelia, a vigorous, spreading groundcover
with dark-green foliage and bright yellow, daisylike blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Ornamental grasses such as zebra grass (Miscanthus sinensis)
with its yellow-banded green foliage, and bamboo muhly
(Muhlenbergia dumosa), highly textural with clouds of feathery
foliage, are good choices. These would pair nicely with daylilies
and black-eyed Susans.
</P>

Chronicle, P.O. Box 4260, Houston, Texas 77210. The bulk of mail
prevents replies to all unpublished letters.

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court sometimes hands down a startling
decision that initially seems silly but on close examination turns
out to be a wise preemptive strike against a growing but barely
perceived cultural problem.
</P>
<P>
   The high bench produced such a decision May 24 when it ruled
that school boards may be held liable if they do nothing to stop
the sexual harassment of one student by another. It immediately
prompted loud wails that the ruling would spawn endless, expensive
lawsuits and drag school administrators into an area of childhood
behavior that is none of their business anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the four
dissenters, warned against this very prospect, grimly predicting an
``avalanche of liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also argued that local school discipline should be
capable of handling ``routine problems of adolescence'' without
invoking Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex
discrimination in educational institutions. He described the
concept of sexual harassment as behavior exclusive to adults, not
the normal conduct of youngsters ``just learning to interact with
their peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he had in mind the notorious case of a six-year-old in
North Carolina who was suspended from school for kissing a
classmate on the cheek a few years ago. Public outrage at that
ridiculous overreaction was so overwhelming that the school was
forced to renounce the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy sounded out of touch with today's reality. Nowadays
children grow up faster than they did in his youth and mine. They
are bombarded with images of explicit sex and violence. They are
not the innocents we used to be at their age.
</P>
<P>
   It does come as a shock to us older folk that the teasing and
flirting among boys and girls that is standard childhood behavior
might become so overtly offensive as to warrant a lawsuit. But that
is what happened in the case confronting the court.
</P>
<P>
   The victim was LaShonda Davis, an 11-year-old girl in the fifth
grade of an elementary school in Monroe County, Ga. She complained
repeatedly to her teachers and to the principal that a male
classmate persistently tried to touch her breasts and genital area
and pressed her to have sex with him. Her grades fell off. She
wrote a suicide note.
</P>
<P>
   School officials did not take her charges seriously and did
nothing _ after all, the boy was only 11. Her mother sued the local
school board for $500,000 in damages. Although she lost in the
lower courts, the Supreme Court has now reinstated her suit. A jury
will determine if the allegations merit a financial remedy.
</P>
<P>
   In her majority opinion, Sandra Day O'Connor tried to draw a
line between crude adolescent horseplay and serious sexual
harassment. To be illegal, she said, it must be ``so severe,
pervasive and objectively offensive that it can be said to deprive
the victims of access to the educational opportunities or benefits
provided by the school.''
</P>
<P>
   In real life, this is going to be a difficult line to draw
except in the most extreme instances. There are no clear guidelines
here. Early flirtations between the sexes are awkward and sometimes
misunderstood at any age.
</P>
<P>
   What if a child exaggerates the conduct of another? What if
officials think boys are merely being boys? What if girls don't
understand the emotions they can arouse with overt flirting? Who is
at fault when trouble arises and what can schools do about it?
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is right. This will mean a big headache for school
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's ruling was a necessary decision. Otherwise, the
justices would have signaled that anything goes in determining what
is acceptable conduct between classmates of the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   Educators now know that they cannot simply ignore behavior that
is embarrassing and hurtful beyond the psychological bumps of
routine childhood interaction. They must put up at least the
appearance of concern, no matter how imperfect their ability to
monitor what the students are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual harassment is no longer a legal problem just for adults.
Now our kids have a remedy for it too.

WANTED: DIRECTOR FOR ALBANY'S OLD JAIL ART CENTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, Texas _ The Old Jail Art Center has added a unique twist
to its profile of candidates for the next museum director's job:
It's looking for an executive who can talk cattle as well as art.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in the historic cattle and oil town of Albany _ about
an hour east of Abilene _ the Old Jail has been without an
executive director since January, when Joeliene Magoto resigned to
accept a post that would take her closer to her family in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it sometimes seems as if the Old Jail Art Center
could run on its own.
</P>
<P>
   It enjoys national exposure. Word has spread via television with
a segment on ``CBS Sunday Morning'' and in a variety of popular
publications.
</P>
<P>
   American and European tourists have responded favorably.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's professionalism is praised by art administrators
ranging from Jack Nokes, president of the Texas Association of
Museums, to Ted Pillsbury, independent consultant and former
director of the Kimbell Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Jail is almost an aberration,'' Nokes says. ``It's
such a fine gem of a museum in such a small community.''
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury points to the museum's wealth of support from patrons
throughout its region. The Old Jail is ``a community organization
in the best sense,'' he says. ``Everyone is encouraged to take part
in it, to take responsibility for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Its collection is solidly based on key groups of pre-Columbian
ceramics, Tang Dynasty tomb figures, modernist works by European
and American artists, and works by Texas artists, primarily of the
20th century. Several of the museum's key holdings _ including an
exquisite Calder mobile and a late painting by Paul Klee _ were
featured in the recent exhibition ``Bill Bomar: The Collector and
the Artist.'' Bomar, who died in 1991, and his cousin Reilly Nail
co-founded the Old Jail in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The original jail building _ which has been augmented by two
modern additions _ is a national landmark, built in 1877 of
hand-hewed local limestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a $2 million endowment and a financially prudent
board,'' Nail adds. ``And we just completed a capital campaign of
about $3.2 million in six months for the new building and its
endowment.''
</P>
<P>
   And the museum's four full-time staff members, board of 12
trustees and host of volunteers are precisely focused and
passionately dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   But as gracefully as the Old Jail flew on autopilot, Nail is
adamant about its need for a new executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing else, we need a director in order to keep our
accreditation,'' he says. Not to mention its standing as a serious
organization: The Old Jail receives unqualified support from
Albany's substantial population of wealthy, Ivy League-educated
citizens. Unmediated by professional administration, that kind of
enthusiasm can turn an institution into a patrons' plaything.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the last thing we want,'' Nail says.
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling block is the pay scale, which is in the
neighborhood of $30,000-$35,000, Nail says. It's the kind of
compensation that would only be attractive to someone starting out
(as Magoto was) or coming to the end of a career _ in other words,
someone motivated by interests other than income.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a point where we've gotten practically nowhere with
this search,'' Nail says. ``We're looking at graduate programs in
arts administration. We have people of some importance out looking
for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not desperate,'' he adds. ``But we're feeling frustrated
_ and that's frustrated in italics.''
</P>
<P>
   So if patience is one of your virtues and you know a polled
Hereford from a horned, then the Old Jail Art Center may have an
offer you can't resist.

QUITAQUE'S GUINEA DROP TRADITION IS UP IN THE AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quitaque is a small, hard-to-spell community of 500 that sits
just beneath the Caprock in Northwest Texas. For most of the year,
people don't pay much attention to the town, unless they go to
Caprock Canyon State Park to see the buffalo, or pass through on
the way to Turkey for Bob Wills Days.
</P>
<P>
   But early each June, Quitaque makes headlines with its annual
National Trails Day celebration and the controversial guinea drop
that goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, things were supposed to be relatively quiet because a
faint-hearted chamber of commerce decided to do away with the
guinea drop and have a guinea bed race instead. Folks were supposed
to sit in the middle of a bed on wheels while holding a guinea.
Teammates pushed them down the main street in town.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant owner Mary Pigg said phooey to that. She wanted a
real drop.
</P>
<P>
   The original guinea drop was the idea of Mary's husband, Roye
Pigg, who used to be a more adventuresome head of the Quitaque
Chamber of Commerce. Roye Pigg had local farmer and pilot Coy
Franks fly over town and drop a guinea out the window of his
single-engine plane. Below, kids craned their necks to see exactly
where the bird would glide.
</P>
<P>
   Guineas aren't great fliers, but they can glide like a condor.
The kids would rush to where the bird landed, capture it, take a
coupon for $100 off its leg and present the bird and coupon to Roye
Pigg. He inspected the bird for damage, then paid off.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the celebration received national attention from animal
rights groups who insisted that dropping the guinea from an
airplane was ``alien to a bird's evolutionary experience'' and
could cause the guinea to ``easily sustain unseen internal
injuries, or be killed, in the trauma of being dropped, followed by
being chased.''
</P>
<P>
   United Poultry Concerns, a Maryland-based animal rights
organization, and several humane societies threatened to send
protesters to Quitaque, but they never showed up. The birds were
not injured.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the current chamber of commerce became worried about
youngsters falling down and skinning their knees while chasing the
fleeing guineas; they worried about liability.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Pigg worried about tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Roye Pigg was killed last year and Mary Pigg wanted to honor his
memory. She insisted that she would continue the guinea drop. She
bought five guineas and wanted Franks to drop them over town. But
Franks had other commitments and couldn't oblige.
</P>
<P>
   So, Pigg decided to climb 20 feet to the top of her Sportsman
Restaurant and drop them from there. ``If we have to drop them off
the top of the Sportsman,'' she announced, ``we're going to have
the guinea drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the guineas flew away and only one swooped to the
ground as it was supposed to. Pigg had advertised three drops, so
that guinea had to make the leap three times.
</P>
<P>
   The other birds showed up at area coops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of nerve-wracking,'' Pigg told a Lubbock reporter
after the drop. ``But it went off without a hitch, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't announced plans for next year.

   My kitchen counter had never looked so good. On top of my
cutting board lay a great heap of flowers _ zucchini flowers. As
large and pristine as lilies and as alive in color as tropical
fruits, the blossoms looked like the remnants of a flower arranging
session, not the lunch they would soon become.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to believe you can eat something so beautiful,
and even more so that you can treat it like a vegetable. But you
can. I chopped the fleshy leaves, which cut like basil, and made a
frittata _ a frittata streaked with the soft orange flower petals
and filled with the flavor of zucchini without any of the wet,
mushy vegetable to weigh it down.
</P>
<P>
   Zucchini blossoms are the fragile precursor to the fruit on a
zucchini plant. They are so visually remarkable that it is easy to
see them as nothing more than decoration. But they have long been a
part of Italian, French and Mexican cooking, the leaves chopped
like an herb and sprinkled into soups and pasta dishes, or filled
with cheese and anchovies, or simply dipped into a light batter and
fried. The blossoms have a subtle flavor and a wildly beautiful
shape, which happens to make a perfect package for stuffing.
They're commonplace in Europe during the season, but have been
virtually unknown here until now, as savvy farmers' markets sell
them to eager home cooks and more chefs experiment with them.
</P>
<P>
   A single plant, which has a life cycle of about two months, will
produce about 50 flowers, some male and some female. Both are
edible. The males grow on a thin stem and are longer and generally
larger than the female flowers. The females are easily
distinguishable: as a bud appears, a tiny bulb forms at its base,
which, as the flower bud grows, expands into a zucchini.
</P>
<P>
   The female flowers are usually harvested when the zucchini is
about two inches long. If a grower has an excess of zucchini, he
will sometimes harvest the baby zucchini and the flower together,
because the flower will survive longer attached to the fruit. Some
cooking authorities, including Marcella Hazan, insist that the
female flowers are inferior to the male. But apart from the slight
difference in size, I found no reason to choose one over the other.
If anything, the males are a little better for stuffing, simply
because they tend to be a little larger.
</P>
<P>
   Some growers believe that harvesting the male blossoms, like
pruning a fruit tree, will concentrate the plant's energy into
growing the fruit. But growers do not harvest all the male flowers,
because each plant needs the males to pollinate the females.
</P>
<P>
   If a grower leaves the plant untouched and harvests just the
fruit, the flowers will shrivel up and die. Which is very likely
the reason zucchini blossoms were originally used in cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's food,'' said Fred Plotkin, the author of ``Recipes From
Paradise: Life and Food on the Italian Riviera'' (Little, Brown,
1997). ``It's not just because it's a flower. It's part of what the
Italians call `cucina di ricupero.''' Literally ``recovery food,''
it is a cooking philosophy in which nothing goes to waste.
</P>
<P>
   In France, especially in Provence, chefs fill zucchini flowers
with everything from brandade to cheese and incorporate them into
vegetable gratins. This time of year, they are always on the menu
at Provence in SoHo. Liz Arana, the chef, puts a pinch of sheep's
milk cheese, fennel and herbs in the blossoms, ties them with
chives, dips them in milk and flour and sautes them in olive oil.
Or she fills them with crab and serves them with a red pepper
aioli.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, cooking zucchini flowers has almost
nothing to do with cultural philosophy or sustenance. Chefs use
them for their flavor and as a nod to seasonal produce. But more
than anything else, the chefs like to take advantage of their
physical beauty. Zucchini flowers are a handy natural wrapper for
other foods; they have a fine papery texture and provide a
delightful visual surprise on the plate. Inspiration abounds. Chefs
tuck cheese and herbs, and sometimes whole shrimp, into the
blossoms, and then fry them.

   CHILEAN SEA BASS STEAMED IN ZUCCHINI BLOSSOMS Adapted from Alan
Tardi, Follonico Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   4 small zucchini (about 1 pound), seeded (if needed) and cut
into \-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   3 cups vegetable or fish broth
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   4 thin scallions, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup densely packed spinach
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 6-ounce pieces of skinned Chilean sea bass fillet or halibut
</P>
<P>
   16 large zucchini blossoms
</P>
<P>
   4 large chervil sprigs for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a medium saucepan, combine zucchini, broth and a pinch of
salt. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat and simmer until tender,
about 10 minutes. Turn off heat. Add scallions and let stand until
soft, about 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   2. Strain zucchini mixture and transfer to a food processor.
Reserve the broth. Add spinach and butter to food processor and
puree until a stiff, smooth sauce forms. Add a little of the
reserved broth if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place 1 cup broth in saucepan and bring to a boil. Whisk in
the zucchini puree. Sauce should have the consistency of a light
cream sauce. Add more broth if necessary. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   4. Heat a large steamer. (If you have only a small steamer,
steam the fish in batches.) Cut each fillet into 4 pieces on a
slight angle so that one end is a little narrower than the other.
Season each piece with salt and pepper. Remove stamens from
zucchini blossoms. Gently stuff the narrow end of each piece of
fish into a blossom. If blossoms are small, tear one side open,
insert fish and wrap sides of blossom around fish.
</P>
<P>
   5. Place blossoms in steamer until blossom is wilted and fish is
cooked, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, warm sauce over medium heat.
</P>
<P>
   6. To serve, spoon a little sauce onto each of 4 plates. Sauce
should make a solid green disk about 5 inches in diameter. Place 4
zucchini blossoms on top of each plate. Garnish with chervil.
</P>

THE FLOWER WAS NEVER JUST FOR THE BEE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nasturtiums in butter. Orchids in cheesecake. Rose
petals with lobster.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of eating flowers may seem effetely modern, but it's a
concept that goes back centuries. Lilacs and pansies and marigolds,
even those orchids, have always had a place on the plate, sometimes
as just a gorgeous garnish but surprisingly often as real food.
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, upscale markets and some Greenmarkets have a
whole range of edible flowers to explore in cooking. Some, with
their vivid colors and fanciful shapes but faint flavor, are best
just as eye candy, like pansies, Johnny-jump-ups, tulips,
carnations, primroses, daisies and orchids. But others have a
unique flavor and scent, from delicately floral violets, jasmine
and chamomile, to intensely perfumed elderflowers, scented
geraniums, lilacs and roses, to spicy and peppery nasturtiums and
marigolds.
</P>
<P>
   John Gottfried, an owner of Gourmet Garage, says he has noticed
an explosion of interest in edible flowers over the last few years.
Last year, the chain stocked about four kinds of organic edible
flowers, but now it carries eight to 10, including marigolds,
nasturtiums, roses, pansies, Johnny-jump-ups and orchids.
</P>
<P>
   They all have time-honored appeal in the kitchen. In medieval
Europe, roses, violets, primroses, dandelions, marigolds and fruit
tree blossoms were candied in honey, boiled into jams and syrups,
distilled for their scents, or even used fresh.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, specially bred chrysanthemums and jasmine have been
used to flavor tea and wine, and lotus petals as a garnish for soup
and salad. In India, roses flavor puddings and jams, much as they
do in Turkey and northern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Roses are used in Moroccan cooking, said Mina Newman, the chef
at Layla, a Middle Eastern restaurant in Manhattan. ``Flowers are a
sign of hospitality,'' she explained. For Mother's Day this year,
she served an all-rose dinner, including a lobster and rose petal
salad, and rose-flavored chocolate truffles.
</P>
<P>
   Roses have decidedly pronounced flavors. Their appeal in Mexican
cooking was immortalized in the movie ``Like Water for Chocolate,''
in which a sauce made with them sent everyone into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   In Ukraine and Georgia, marigolds are common in the kitchen,
said Ari Nieminen, the chef at Firebird, which serves Russian
foods. He uses them fresh in salads for their pleasantly bitter
herbal flavor, and in a stuffed tomato dish, where they contribute
a saffronlike nuance.
</P>
<P>
   Like marigolds, nasturtiums have a lively, peppery flavor. They
are ubiquitous in salads and are often sold as part of a mesclun
mix. But they can also brighten a vinaigrette or marinade. Samara
Farber, a former private chef in New York, purees the blossoms with
softened seasoned butter that she molds into a tubelike shape and
chills. When sliced and served on hot grilled fish, the flowers
leave a confetti trail of red, orange and yellow flecks as the
butter melts. And the flavor has a subtle spicy kick that is
heightened by the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Gottfried of Gourmet Garage says that orchids are particularly
good as a garnish because they are ``nature's way of showing off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Caterers love orchids because they make a great
presentation,'' he added. That's why Parker Stafford, the chef at
Merchant's on 62nd Street in Manhattan, uses orchid petals in a
ricotta cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with all fresh flowers is that their flavor is
evanescent. Just-picked roses are more potent than roses a few days
old. If they are heated too much, their color and flavor fade. So
Matthew Lake, the chef of 27 Standard on 27th Street, in Manhattan,
adds julienned petals only once the sauce for his roasted pheasant
is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Ann-Michele Andrews, the pastry chef at Judson Grill in midtown,
garnishes her rice pudding flavored with rosewater with rose petals
she candies herself. She brushes the rinsed and dried petals with
beaten egg white, then sprinkles them with extra-fine granulated
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Gourmet Garage sells a mix of edible flowers, 18 to 24 blossoms,
for $3.95. Edible flowers are also available at Balducci's and at
some Greenmarkets.

HEIDI COUNTRY, WITH FRENCH FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., June 20) 
(jt) 
 By GLENN COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great lightning summer getaway to the French Alps began as a
timeout during the dream tour, a 30th wedding anniversary trip to
France with our two sons. We reasoned that after days of
togetherness exploring Normandy last July _ examining the Bayeux
Tapestry, poking into nearly every pillbox on the Calvados coast
and standing awe-struck in the great American cemetery at
Colleville-sur-Mer _ it might be wise to separate for a while.
Then, we could appreciate one another even more when we reunited.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the plan: our sons, Brian and Alex, generously agreed to
endure four days of residence in the Paris we love, without the
inhibiting presence of their parents. They reassured Sarah and me
that this would be an acceptable sacrifice for two handsome,
unattached guys in their mid-20s.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mom and Dad, the madcap anniversary revelers, would
zoom off to the Alps in a rented Mercedes (OK, this was the big
anniversary, not the budget trip). A week later, after the older
generation marveled at snowcapped vistas, the baby boomers and the
Gen-X'ers would meet up in the eighth arrondissement with many
exciting tales to tell.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with this plan was our utter ignorance of the
French Alps, which we had never visited, and therefore were
passionate about. Friends fueled our rabid Alpinism by contending
that, in the Haute-Savoie, we'd have all the joys of Heidi country,
but with French food.
</P>
<P>
   If the French Alps at a distance seemed initially confusing to a
couple of neophytes, we had two firm but humble ambitions: we
wanted to test ourselves with some strenuous mountain hiking, and
we wanted to have the garden-variety tourist experience of riding
the Aiguille du Midi cable car to its famous 12,600-foot view of
Mont Blanc.
</P>
<P>
   But where to stay? For weeks beforehand we scouted the
guidebooks, and Sarah zapped Alpine Web sites. It seemed that
Chamonix, site of the first Olympic Winter Games in 1924, was
definitely the center of the action for nonwinter visitors. But
there were all of these other legendary towns with marquee ski
names such as Albertville, Courchevel, Megeve and Val d'Isere.
</P>
<P>
   At last we chose Megeve because the Web site pictures were
wonderfully quaint and because the town was the home of an unusual
hotel that intrigued us from its Internet presentation: Les Fermes
de Marie, an Alpine mini-hamlet that seemed to offer a country
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   And so, soon enough, we were braving suicidal Citroens in the
counterclockwise bedlam of l'Etoile during the morning rush. Within
an hour we were rolling along the A6 past field after field of
sunflowers under cloud-flecked skies.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in Megeve in late afternoon, after a 380-mile drive
and a lunch stop in Beaune. Tooling about as we quested for Les
Fermes de Marie, Megeve appeared beyond-belief picturesque: narrow,
winding cobblestone streets, village squares, weathered fountains,
ivy-covered walls of Savoy ocher and a 14th century church with a
bulbous bronze-green belltower.
</P>
<P>
   As we learned during our stay, Megeve is a curious mixture of
chic and rustic, balancing luxury boutiques and agricultural
festivals, with accommodations ranging from four-star hotels to
farmhouse rooms. Days were warm, with low humidity, and mountain
nights were refreshing; ever visible were the surrounding Alps and
the lush expanse of meadows beneath granite peaks.
</P>
<P>
   We discovered that unlike Chamonix (with its importunate
traffic, its 100,000 summer day-trippers and its hodgepodge of
hotels) and unlike Courchevel (with its planned ski developments),
Megeve is a true village, a center of commerce for 80 surrounding
farms. Thanks to the serendipities of Savoy history, many Megevan
buildings survive from the 15th and 16th centuries. Preservation
and building codes have discouraged the high-rise mania rampant in
other Alpine villages, and Megeve bans autos in the town center.
</P>
<P>
   Les Fermes de Marie turned out to be a hotel that is an ersatz
Savoy village of eight chalets on two acres, with 69 guest rooms,
virtually all of them affording a postcard view of the Rochebrune
Alp.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, Jean-Louis Sibuet and his wife, Jocelyne, are both
second-generation hoteliers who have crafted Les Fermes into their
one-of-a-kind statement, almost as if it were an interconnected
hamlet of Frenchified Joseph Cornell boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The public rooms are a charm festival of antiques, folk art and
warm plaids, seemingly arrayed by a Savoyard Ralph Lauren. In the
homey spaces of Les Fermes, visitors walk under ancient exposed
farmhouse beams on creaky floors through hallways lined with
equally ancient agricultural implements and bosky artifacts:
200-year-old Savoyard pottery, 100-year-old cheese presses, and
sheaves of wheat. There are antique prints as well as folk-art
paintings and wood carvings in a Savoyard naif style, many of them
created by both Sibuets, who have used the hotel as a gallery for
their own art. If on first view the ambiance is aggressively
hospitable, it all works somehow. So does the spa.
</P>
<P>
   Our cozy ground-floor room in a wing of the warrenlike compound
was furnished with French country pieces including a 17th century
armoire, a 200-year-old walnut table, a rose-figured rustic
bedspread; the large well-appointed bathroom was lined with glowing
tiles of rose, pink and white from Salernes.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the 10-year-old Les Fermes has not been
discovered by Americans, who form only 4 percent of the summer
clientele. ``It is famous in Italy and France, and the concept is
being much imitated in Europe,'' said Andre Seigneur, director of
the Megeve Tourist Office, when we encountered him later in the
week. But, he said, copycats have a difficult time duplicating the
Sibuets' construction techniques.
</P>
<P>
   To build Les Fermes, Sibuet spent most of a decade visiting the
farms of Megeve, surviving endless courtesies, negotiations and not
a few libations, while asking farmers if he could buy the
centuries-old wood from venerable abandoned barns and shepherd
outposts. The antique lumber collection he amassed _ some of the
wood 300 years old, from 60 barns and houses _ became his inventory
for new construction, the frame upon which he built Les Fermes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each piece of wood has a story, and each farmer told me that
story,'' said the 43-year-old Sibuet, after I introduced myself and
asked about Les Fermes. ``Ultimately the farmers would have put the
wood in the fire. But now it has a place. And now the farmers are
proud of their wood and come here to visit it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sibuet said she sees Les Fermes as an expression of
mountain life and Savoyard culture _ ``the wood, the antiques, the
artifacts, the cuisine.'' As for the last, we sampled the offerings
at the Grand Salle, the hotel's main restaurant (there are two
others), which seats 140, with its floor of worn 200-year-old
terra-cotta tiles rescued from ancient Savoy castles. We tasted
appetizers (a bacon souffle and fat little grilled bacon-wrapped
langoustines with risotto and local mushrooms) and entrees (sea
bass and pork) and accompanied it all with a robust local $20 gamay
that perfectly complemented the puissant Savoy food.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we took a stroll into town, a seven-minute
streamside walk by the River Arly. We discovered not only Hermes
and Faconnable, but also Le Comptoir, an antiques store that has a
Paris headquarters and is filled with Black Forest treasures. We
also took in the legendarily upscale Aallard ski emporium, where
stretch ski pants were pioneered and where, in winter, jet-setters
secure not just their skis but also their more essential apres-ski
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   We visited the tourist office at the Maison des Freres on Rue
Monseigneur Conseil, a former monastery and school with
three-foot-thick walls that was built in 1730. ``Our goal is to
maintain our Savoy identity and quality of life while increasing
our international clientele, and making the summer season longer,''
Seigneur said. ``But we cannot grow too much.'' Megeve has 5,000
residents but swells to 40,000 in the winter and summer tourist
seasons. Summer tourism in Megeve _ which was established in the
11th century and became a small but fashionable health resort 100
years ago _ actually preceded the winter invasions of the beautiful
people. It wasn't until 1916 that the Baroness Maurice de
Rothschild decreed that Megeve should become a French ski resort
akin to St. Moritz in Switzerland. She attracted kings, queens,
moguls, politicians and the idle rich.
</P>
<P>
   The director Roger Vadim shot ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' with
Jeanne Moreau at the Hotel Mont Blanc, which we found in the Place
de l'Eglise. Jean Cocteau, who decorated the bar in the hotel
(which the Sibuets now own, in addition to four other Megevan
hotels), named it Les Enfants Terribles. Encountering so many
Parisians, he dubbed Megeve the 21st arrondissement of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Near the tourist office, the staff of the Mountain Guide Office
at Maison de la Montagne told us that no fewer than 31 guides from
Megeve were available for personal or group mountain jaunts. Among
the recreational options are hiking, summer bobsledding, fishing,
riding, paragliding, mountain biking, rafting, cycling, rock
climbing, long-distance glacier walks and even a six-day climbing
course with a guide leading to the summit of Mont Blanc. And yes,
there is tennis and swimming and golf.
</P>
<P>
   Megeve is also a paradise for randonnees _ rambles, or
unstructured hiking _ with marked trails offering walks that flaunt
Alpine views while threading past farms and waterfalls, through
forests, extravagant wildflower meadows and cool forests of pine.
For newcomers, there are several lovely three-to-four-hour hikes
from the top stage of the cable lift at Rochebrune; these and
longer hikes are depicted on a map (available at the tourist
center) that details nearly 100 miles of walking trails.
</P>
<P>
   And then, we took time out from four days and uncounted miles of
glorious hiking to achieve our other goal. Following the directions
of Ghali Bennani, the concierge at Les Fermes, we drove 22
mountainous miles on improbably scenic roads to Chamonix, the
overcrowded Mont Blanc mecca that is the staging area for the cable
car to Aiguille du Midi, the splinter of granite that affords a
dramatic view of Mont Blanc. When we arrived, the famously long
lines had dispersed that morning because it was foggy and overcast.
We chose to take the cable car up into the fog anyway, even though
we were told at the ticket booth (round-trip tickets $32) that
there was no view of Mont Blanc.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring past the spectacular Bossons glacier as we ascended, we
hit the fog bank, as promised. Miraculously, though, near the top
of the Aiguille, we punched through the fog to the brilliant sun
above. After ascending to the terrace, we had a startling panorama
of Mont Blanc and the surrounding Alps rising from pillowy mist.
</P>
<P>
   On our last day in Megeve we visited L'Alpage du Pre Rosset, a
chalet renovated from a shepherd's barn high on Rochebrune, where
the Sibuets invite the guests from their five hotels to mingle and
meet for lunch. When we arrived, the great silence of the mountains
was broken only by the distant chime of cowbells and a burr of a
breeze. Then some 46 of us sat for a rollicking alfresco meal at a
long communal table under the Alpine sun.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, we drove back to Paris for the grand reunion. Our
celebratory toast in our room at Hotel Le Bristol was spontaneous,
and heartfelt: we vowed not to wait 30 years to return, touched our
glasses and said, ``Bonnes vacances!''
</P>
<P>
   A picture-postcard village, plus high-altitude excursions &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting There
</P>
<P>
   Megeve itself can be done on a day trip, but a minimum of four
days is advisable for those wishing to explore the town and its
hiking trails, while using it as a base to visit Chamonix, Le
Montenvers, the great Mer de Glace glacier, and the cable-car
thrills of the neighboring Alps.
</P>
<P>
   By car, Megeve is an hour from Geneva, two hours from Lyons and
six hours from Paris (with no stops). It is also possible to take
the TGV from Paris to Sallanches, which is seven miles from Megeve.
Information
</P>
<P>
   Although Megeve has 37,000 tourist beds, it is often tightly
booked in August, during the annual vacations taken by what
sometimes seems like the entire French population. But during June,
July, September and early October the crowds are gone and, except
during festivals, such as the week around July 14, there are hotel
bargains.

CABLESS IN LONDON: STRANDED AFTER DARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., June 20) 
(jt) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Eleven p.m. in London's West End: The theaters have
emptied. The movie crowd is spilling onto the streets. The pubs,
regulated by Britain's licensing laws, are about to close. The one
thing that's missing: a taxi ride home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Mae West didn't quite say: so many people, so little
transport. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For months now, an outcry has been building among Londoners and
visitors to the city about the erratic late-night behavior of the
traditional London black cab, a creature of increasingly
unpredictable nocturnal habits, particularly in the West End area
between Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus that is crammed with
pubs, clubs, theaters and cinemas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even the black-cab drivers themselves admit it. ``Virtually
every taxi driver I know now regards the West End as a no-go
area,'' said Keith White, a cabdriver, in a recent letter that was
published in the Evening Standard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The need for cabs has blossomed, according to Bob Oddy, general
secretary of London's Licensed Taxi Drivers Association. ``There's
been a dramatic upsurge in the number of pubs and clubs in the last
couple of years,'' he said. ``Demand has gone through the roof.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supply hasn't. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the official count, London has around 24,000 black
cabs _ most of them driven by their owners _ which sounds as if it
ought to be enough. But of those, around 6,000 operate through
computerized central booking systems, and do not routinely pick up
passengers who hail them on the streets. And the majority of the
rest of the black cabs, Oddy said, work days only. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the numbers is a tale of two conflicts. One pits licensed
drivers of the traditional London taxicab against the drivers of
what are called mini-cabs _ private automobiles used as cabs, with
or without a radio link to a dispatcher. The other pits the
black-cab drivers against would-be passengers who want to travel
where the driver does not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the would-be passenger is the loser. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlicensed mini-cabs are thought by the police to number some
50,000, and their drivers have no qualms about muscling into the
late-night theater crowd _ technically illegal because they are
unlicensed and thus barred from cruising for business. These are
the cars, according to many licensed black-cab drivers, that park
unlawfully, clog the streets and make it impossible for black-cab
drivers to make a living. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And since the surcharge to ride a black cab between 8 p.m. and
midnight is only $1 above the fare on the meter, said Oddy, there's
not much incentive for drivers to work nights. But taking mini-cabs
can be problematic.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mini-cabs may be uninsured. They have no meters, so the fares,
theoretically lower than black-cab fares, are a matter of
negotiation. To make things more confusing, many older black cabs
have recently been sold off to private buyers because of new laws
requiring black cabs to provide wheelchair access. That means that
what looks like a black cab to the untutored eye may in fact be a
decommissioned black cab with a mini-cab driver at the wheel. (The
only way to spot the difference is to check for a meter: unlicensed
cabs don't have them.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, mini-cab drivers are not obliged to learn what
black-cab drivers call ``the knowledge'' _ the compendiumlike
familiarity with London's highways and by-ways that is required to
secure a license. And far more chilling, there have been frequent
reports of men masquerading as mini-cab drivers in order to pick up
women passengers, drive them to secluded places and sexually
assault them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So that leaves waiting for a black cab, right?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By law, Oddy said, as soon as a black cab stops for a passenger,
the driver is obliged to take the passenger anywhere within a
six-mile radius. But it doesn't always work that way. Sometimes
black-cab drivers will turn down a passenger because it suits them
to do so _ witness the following exchange near Oxford Circus at
around 11.15 on a recent Friday night between this correspondent
and the driver of a black cab. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Highgate, please.'' ``That's north, not east. I'm going east.
Going home.'' Exit black cab.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are attempts to improve the situation. A law has been
enacted that will at some stage require mini-cabs to be licensed,
meaning that the cars will be inspected for road-worthiness and
that certain categories of driver _ including criminals, illegal
immigrants and moonlighting welfare recipients _ will be barred. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Equally, most London residents and hotel concierges know of
reputable mini-cab companies (some will provide female drivers and
carry only female passengers) or black-cab companies that can be
booked in advance to meet the passenger outside a theater. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the millennium, though, you might plan to walk.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even at New Year's in an ordinary year, only about one fifth of
black-cab drivers go to work. And on Dec. 31, 1999, according to
Oddy, black-cab drivers will demand a $40 bonus from every single
passenger if they are to work at all.

THE BATTLE TO SAVE OLD COOKBOOKS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Betty Fussell, a food writer best known for a book on
the history of corn, says she often buys books rather than trying
to use those in the New York Public Library. ``Everything is
inaccessible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, to her and other food researchers, means the books
kept in the library's annex at 521 W. 43rd St., off 10th Avenue.
The annex was closed to the public in the spring of 1994. The
library decided that it was more efficient for the public to use
annex materials at the main building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd
Street, where security is better.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, researchers have had to request volumes at the main
library and then wait days for them to be delivered. Some
researchers warn that an irreplaceable trove of culinary knowledge
is in disarray, as books are no longer delivered between floors but
across town.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Smith, who has written a history of ketchup and is
awaiting publication of ``Popped Culture: A Social History of
Popcorn'' by the University of South Carolina Press, said he flies
to Washington to use the Library of Congress in preference to
trying to get the research materials he needs from the New York
library's collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can take three days to get a book from the annex _ if
you're lucky,'' he said. ``Half the time, the books are missing or
misplaced, and the condition they're in is often a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Protests over the inaccessibility and condition of the books
have spurred the library, which acknowleges the problems, to make
changes. With some 100,000 food-related books, 20,000 of them
cookbooks, the library boasts the second-largest culinary
collection in the country after the Library of Congress. Although
some of the older books are in the rare book room at the main
library, most are stored in the annex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I routinely get calls from researchers who are frustrated and
intimidated trying to use the New York Public Library's
collection,'' said Barbara Haber, the curator of books of the
Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass., which
is known for its culinary collection. ``Food history is becoming
more serious. Many scholars are doing dissertations that are food
related. From where I sit it's a great collection, so why not take
care of it?''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Alexandra Leaf, the president of the Culinary
Historians of New York, wrote to the organization's 255 members
warning that ``a large number of books in the New York Public
Library's culinary collection have badly deteriorated: bindings are
worn, pages are crumbling or missing, and covers are chipped and
cracked.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Coe, the chairman of the group's cookbook committee,
followed up with a letter to Dr. Paul LeClerc, the library's
president, stressing the importance of the collection and
suggesting remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Bowen, the library's director of humanities, then informed
Coe that the collection would be cleaned and put in protective
boxes, and transferred to a storage center with zones of
temperature and humidity controls. The center, which the library is
building in Princeton, N.J., is expected to be completed in about
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Once the books are transferred there, they will be delivered on
request to Manhattan the next day. Though Coe wrote in his letter
that he was alarmed by ``the specter of fragile materials being
shipped back and forth on the New Jersey Turnpike,'' he offered his
group's help, including fund-raising, to preserve the culinary
collection. Some books, he said, might not survive until the new
center is finished.
</P>
<P>
   As examples, he cited a copy of ``Le Maitre d'Hotel Francais,''
a cookbook written in 1822 by Antoine Careme, some of whose foldout
illustrations are tattered or missing altogether. He also mentioned
that one volume had been lost from Careme's five-volume ``L'Art de
la Cuisine Francais au 19th Siecle,'' published 145 years ago, and
other volumes have pages torn or missing.
</P>
<P>
   On June 3 representatives of the library agreed to begin moving
17th- and 18th-century cookery volumes from the annex to the rare
book room, where they will be more accessible. A maximum of 50
books (of perhaps 80) will be moved, joining some 25,000 historic
menus, one of the world's largest collections, in the rare book
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Coe gave us a very helpful list of rare books that are in
the general collection,'' Ms. Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer, which will begin with ``Le Nouveau et Parfaict
Cuisinier'' (1668) by Pierre de Lune, is expected to take about a
year. The rest of the books will eventually be sent to Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   The library has also agreed to allow scholars wishing to consult
works catalogued as ``V'' class, which accounts for most of the
culinary collections, to do so soon in the rare book room.
</P>
<P>
   As for the group's offer to raise money to try to save the
collection, Coe said that the library's directors did not encourage
special provisions for the culinary books. But, he said, the
library's development office is exploring ways to allow the group
to raise $100,000 for a curator to repair and restore materials.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bowen, the library's humanities director, said, ``If there
are people using our collections, and they have special concerns,
I'm willing to listen.''

<P>
   A 10-Year Bet on Ken Burns  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Contortions of envy may well ripple through the documentary
filmmakers' world Thursday. That is when General Motors plans to
announce an unusual 10-year commitment to underwrite the future
film projects of Ken Burns.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors has been the sole corporate underwriter for
Burns' earlier films, like ``The Civil War,'' ``Baseball'' and one
coming out in the fall, ``Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.''
</P>
<P>
   But these have been financed on a film-by-film basis. The
arrangement being announced Thursday will commit GM to financing 35
percent of every documentary project that Burns undertakes for the
next 10 years, and to paying for 100 percent of the extensive
educational projects that accompany his films, which are produced
for public television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'd worked for 20 years and had not made a real
clunker, I thought they might take a flier on me for more than one
film at a time,'' Burns said by telephone from his editing studio
in Walpole, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The grant's dollar value cannot be specified since the films
have not yet been budgeted or even conceived. Burns' breakthrough
documentary, ``The Civil War'' in 1990, cost about $3.5 million to
produce, but it was 11 hours long. The three-hour ``Frank Lloyd
Wright,'' shown last fall, cost less than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said the deal would provide financial stability not only
for himself and his company, Florentine Films, but also for the
scores of associates who work on his films on a freelance basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a long-term commitment allows you to do some real
long-range planning,'' Burns said. ``I still have to go out and
raise the other 65 percent, and that's not a snap of the finger.
But now, if we have a good idea and it stands the test of our own
poking and prodding, at least we've got this head start on a
budget. And it gives comfort to other underwriters when we approach
them, because they can see it has a shape and a form already.''
</P>
<P>
   For General Motors, it is a chance to burnish a prestigious
relationship with an established ``cultural icon,'' as Phil
Guarascio, vice president and general manager for marketing and
advertising, the executive in charge of the arrangement, described
Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Guarascio said the company had usually spent more on promotion
and on educational programs for a Burns film than on the film
itself, providing booklets, posters, CDs and so on to schools and
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Also, General Motors also prides itself on sponsoring a
filmmaker who has trained many others. The company and Burns
calculated that 20 to 25 of those who have worked with him through
the years have ``graduated'' to decision-making creative positions
on Burns' films or on those of other documentary filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are Stephen Ives, Ric Burns ( Burns' brother) and
Michael Hill, who have gone on to make their own documentaries, and
Lynn Novick, Paul Barnes and Dayton Duncan, who have become
co-producers with Burns on his projects. Several others who began
as apprentices at Florentine Films have become renowned sound
editors, film editors or writers.
</P>
<P>
   Burns has 8 to 10 full-time employees, he said, and about 40
people at work when a major project is under way, like ``Jazz,'' a
20-hour series scheduled to be shown on PBS in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   After the Stanton-Anthony film (Nov. 7 and 8 on PBS) and the
jazz series, Burns plans to make a film about Mark Twain. He is
contemplating one about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., as
well as a series on the National Parks system.

   Financial Competitors  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wasting no time in seeking to capitalize on the departure of Lou
Dobbs from CNN's ``Moneyline'' program, CNBC announced Tuesday that
it was rushing to complete an expansion of its own evening
financial news roundup to a full hour, from 30 minutes. Starting
Monday, the program, ``Business Center,'' will begin at 6:30
weeknights, the same time as ``Moneyline.''
</P>
<P>
   CNBC left no doubt about the reason for the expansion, citing
``recent changes in the financial news arena.'' Dobbs quit as the
anchor of CNN's ``Moneyline'' last week. That program has had the
highest advertiser price-per-thousand viewers of any on CNN,
higher, in fact, than that of virtually every other news program on
any channel.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC's ``Business Center'' has been the main competitor for
``Moneyline'' for advertisers. (``The Nightly Business Report'' on
PBS competes for financial news viewers but of course does not run
commercials.) Yet ``Business Center'' attracts only about half as
many people as the CNN program.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC spokesman George Jamison said the network was ``bringing in
its big guns'' as co-anchors to try to raise the profile of
``Business Center.'' The big guns are Ron Insana and Sue Herera,
the two most prominent daily anchors for the network.
</P>
<P>
   Insana, anchor of the two-hour afternoon program ``Street
Signs,'' will cut back to one hour on that assignment. Ms. Herera
will give up her role on ``The Edge,'' which now runs from 6 to 7
p.m. but will be shortened to a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Bartiromo, the current anchor of ``Business Center,'' has
signed a new contract with CNBC that will include taking over the
first hour of the daily ``Street Signs'' and serving as the anchor
for a new program every Friday evening at 7, due to start in the
fall.

<P>
   Here's a Story ...
</P>
<P>
   Though word has leaked out all over the television industry, NBC
News refused Tuesday to make official the news that it has hired as
a co-host of its planned ``Later Today'' program no less a cultural
icon than Florence Henderson, the once and forever mother Brady of
``The Brady Bunch'' and onetime purveyor of ``Wessonality'' in a
memorable series of television commercials for Wesson Oil.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC executives confirmed unofficially Tuesday that she would
be joining the previously announced Jodi Applegate, who is leaving
``Weekend Today'' to lead the new program as host, as well as Asha
Blake, a former news anchor from NBC's station in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   If that triumvirate makes ``Later Today'' sound like NBC's
version of ABC's daily all-female talkfest, ``The View,'' NBC's
unofficial response is that its program will be more news-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ms. Henderson has news credentials, the NBC executives
pointed out. In 1959 she was one of the ``Today girls,'' as they
were known back then, doing interviews and other related work for
the ``Today'' show with Dave Garroway.
</P>
<P>
   More recently she has been a frequent contributor to
``Politically Incorrect'' on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later Today'' will start Sept. 7 at 9 a.m., part of an NBC
effort to hold onto the huge audience now commanded by ``Today,''
which has been flowing into programs not owned by the network.

 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Larry Tse, who opened his charming The House
restaurant in North Beach in 1994, characterizes his food as a
``modern and relevant expression of Asian American food.'' The
combinations he prepares are cross-cultural blends that Tse
prepared at home in his pre-restaurant days as an accountant.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most expressive dishes is his Warm Wasabi House
Noodles with Grilled Pork. The dish is a masterful study in
contrasting tastes, textures and temperature. The noodles take on
smoky nuances from being stir-fried in a hot wok; the spicy warmth
of wasabi adds even more complexity. The pork is grilled and placed
on top of cool cucumbers to create a vibrant dish.
</P>
<P>
   Naming the restaurant The House was natural for Tse because he
considers what he does to be home cooking. The interior has a
modern but comfortable feel, and the care that Tse puts into his
food is evident in the warm surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The House, 1230 Grant Ave. (near Vallejo), San Francisco; &LR; 
 &LR; (415) 986-8612. Open for lunch Monday- &LR;   &LR; Friday and dinner

   &UR; The temperature of the noodles. &LR;  The noodles are allowed to sit
after cooking so they're just warm, which intensifies the flavor
and sets up a contrast to the cool cucumbers and the hot grilled
pork.

   &UR; A hot wok. &LR;  Called ``wok hay,'' stir-frying the noodles in an
extremely hot wok adds a smoky flavor that can't be achieved any
other way. &QL;

 for the Holiday  
   
 By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  When I was a child, the Fourth of July meant
potato salad, hot dogs, upside-down cake or strawberry ice cream,
and sparklers, plus the thrill of watching fountains of colorful
fireworks shoot into the night sky.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In those long-ago days, this event took place in back yards,
where we pooled our food and fireworks so we had a lavish supply of
food and a lengthy display of fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasure and traditions of our old holidays have changed,
but we can still enjoy sharing our traditional dishes, either
outdoors picnic-style or around the table.
</P>
<P>
   The Peach Upside-down Cake is very good and simple to make. If
the idea of making a cake overwhelms you, serve a different
foolproof dessert: sugared sliced fresh strawberries in individual
bowls with a sauce of melted strawberry ice cream on top.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Marion Cunningham, Bay Area cooking teacher, is the author of &LR; 
 &LR; ``Learning to Cook,'' ``Cooking With Children,'' ``The Fannie &LR;

PEACH UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Caramel Topping
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, cut into four pieces
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   4 or 5 ripe peaches, peeled, halved and pitted (enough peach
halves to cover the bottom of a 10-inch skillet)
</P>
<P>
   Cake Batter
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   21/4 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Use either a 10-inch round
skillet, 2-inches deep, or any cake pan that size. The pan must be
able to hold 2 quarts. If you use a cake pan, dissolve and mix the
caramel topping in a small saucepan and then spread it over the
bottom of the cake pan. If you are using a skillet with other than
a metal handle, wrap the handle in 2 thicknesses of aluminum foil
so it won't burn when it is in the oven. It is also a good idea to
put a baking sheet under the skillet or pan so if the fruit juices
bubble over the edge of the pan the baking sheet will catch them.
It is easier to clean a baking sheet than the bottom of your oven.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Making the Caramel Topping:  &LR; Put the butter, brown sugar and
heavy cream into the skillet or a small saucepan pan. Put the
skillet or pan over low heat and stir the mixture until the butter
has melted and the topping is smooth. This only takes a minute or
two. If you are using a cake pan, spread the topping over the
bottom of the cake pan.
</P>
<P>
   Put the peach halves on top of the caramel, pitted-side up. The
smooth rounded part of the peach will show when the cake is turned
out onto a plate. Set aside while you prepare the cake batter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mixing the Cake Batter: &LR;  Put the vegetable shortening in a
large mixing bowl. Add the sugar and use a hand-held electric mixer
or a large spoon to mix the shortening and sugar together until
smooth. Add the eggs and vanilla and vigorously stir the mixture _
or mix with a hand-held electric mixer _ until it becomes creamy
and well blended.
</P>
<P>
   Add the flour, baking powder and salt to the shortening and
sugar. Don't worry if the mixture is rather dry and clumpy. Add the
milk all at once and stir until the batter becomes smooth and
blended.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Adding the Batter to the Pan:  &LR; Using a spatula, spread the
batter evenly over the peaches and topping. Spread it gently and
ease it to the edge of the skillet or pan. Remember, when you
finish baking the cake and turn it upside-down, the peaches that
are on the bottom will be on the top of the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Put the skillet or pan in the oven and set the timer for 30
minutes. When rings, check the cake for doneness. It should look
golden on top, but test by inserting a toothpick into the center of
the cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is done; if not, bake for
another 5 minutes and test again. When it is done, take the cake
out of the oven and let cool for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To remove the cake from the pan, run a knife around the edge of
the pan. Put a plate that is larger than the cake over the pan.
Holding the pan and the plate firmly, quickly turn the pan upside
down so the cake lands on the plate with the peaches on top.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the cake with lightly sweetened whipped cream. (Add 3
tablespoons of sugar to 1 cup of heavy cream in a mixer bowl and
beat with a rotary beater until the cream softly holds its shape.)

BI-RITE MARKET RESTORES NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING TO MISSION 
 DISTRICT OF SAN FRANCISCO  
   
  
</HEADLINE>
  
EDITORS NOTE: Bay Area Classics profiles food-related businesses
more than a half century old.    By Tara Duggan 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; From the time it opened in 1940 and through the
next few decades, Bi-Rite was the sort of market where neighborhood
housewives could do all their daily shopping and police officers
stopped by on their daily beats. But as supermarket chains
gradually took over, this Mission store went the way of some
independent grocers, relegated to offering a few cases of beer and
a handful of shriveled onions for stop-gap shopping.
<P>
   Last year, former restaurant chef Sam Mogannam took over the
store that had been in his family for decades. His renovation
restored not only Bi-Rite's classic look but also its dedication to
service and quality foods.
</P>
<P>
   Customers are welcomed by the original neon sign, which was
celebrated in Michael F. Crowe's book, ``Deco by the Bay'' (Penguin
Studio, 1995). Inside the store, farm carts overflow with fresh
produce, artisan breads and cheeses; the deli counter is stocked
with items like house-smoked lox and roast chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the staff followed Sam to the store after the closing of
Rendezvous du Monde, the family's Financial District restaurant, so
former restaurant managers work the registers and chefs cook
prepared foods.
</P>
<P>
   Ned and Jack Mogannam, Sam's father and uncle, took over the
shop in 1964. Now 31, Sam recalls stories from a childhood filled
with afternoons working at the store alongside his sister Freida
and brother Sal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I grew up in two places _ in the Mission and in
West Portal,'' says Sam, who at age six would take the streetcar
alone from his family's home to his parents' shop.
</P>
<P>
   By 1987, when Ned and Jack sold the business to an independent
operator, the store's fresh inventory had been reduced to almost
nothing. But Bi-Rite was saved from the jaws of convenience store
death in 1997, when the transitional owner gave up the store and
Sam took over with his youngest brother, Raphael. They closed the
store for eight months while they renovated it, and reopened it
last June.
</P>
<P>
   Sam's restoration included reopening two skylights and cleaning
up the original deco light fixtures. The brightly tiled facade was
retained, with new stainless steel added for a shiny edge. Sam
worked with friends to create a logo based on the original sign and
commissioned a mosaic for the entryway.
</P>
<P>
   Sam works directly with growers to get organic produce, and
hopes that customers will get used to a more European style of
shopping, planning their menu according to what's in season instead
of a fixed recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Bi-Rite is one of several businesses in this part of the Mission
to become more upscale. Other recent entries include the sleek
Dolores Park Cafe and wildly popular Delfina restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of negative press about the gentrification of
the neighborhood,'' Sam says. ``Some people question if I'm adding
to it. I feel we're just providing a great product.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite changes in the Mission, a number of customers from the
old days still frequent the store. ``Every once in a while someone
will walk in and say, `Hey, I recognize you from when you were 10
years old,''' Sam says. ``It's encouraging to know that they
continue to shop here.''

 CHRON  
EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The San Francisco Chronicle's panel of
professional tasters tries a different product available in
supermarkets.    TASTERS CHOICE: Wonder Burger Buns Come Out on Top _ Barely  
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Summertime means grilling, and although many
people make what they consider a perfect burger, few think about
the bun they put it on.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Packages suggest buns are relatively similar, varying most in
fat _ from 11/2 to 4 grams. Prices are also fairly close with most
in the $1.50-$1.75 range for eight. Some have sesame seeds; most do
not.
</P>
<P>
   Today's panel sampled nine brands of hamburger buns but the
panel couldn't reach a consensus. Different panelists had different
favorites, so no one brand dramatically outscored the others. In
fact, most of the brands were within ten points of each other.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wonder  &LR; (eight buns, 12 ounces, $1.59 at many supermarkets)
took first place. One panelist described it as ``a cute little
bun,'' while another thought it was ``very ballpark, backyard
barbecue, all-American.'' But another disliked the sweet flavor and
limp texture. Four would buy it; one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; The Cake Box &LR;  (six buns, 12 ounces, $1.59
at Andronico's), the most expensive bun tasted. All the panelists
liked the look, which one described as homemade. Two panelists
liked the flavor, and one thought it had the best balance of
acidity to sweetness. But another panelist thought the texture was
too soft, and the flavor both too sweet and too salty. Three would
buy it, one might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nature's Cupboard &LR;  (eight buns, 18.5 ounces, $1.49 at Safeway)
and  &UR; Van de Kamp's  &LR; (eight buns, 12 ounces, $.99 at Cala) tied for
third.
</P>
<P>
   Two panelists liked the look of Nature's Cupboard, but others
thought the flavor was too bland. One panelist thought it would
hold up well to a juicy burger. Two would buy it, two might buy it,
and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists loved the look of Van de Kamp's, but some
complained of a yeasty taste. One panelist described it as ``airy
as cotton candy,'' but another thought it would be good with a
burger. One would buy it, three might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rainbo  &LR; (eight buns, 12 ounces, $1.69 at Andronico's) came in
sixth. Some thought it looked like a traditional American hamburger
bun. Two panelists disliked the sweetness, but another described
the flavor as pleasant and wheaty. One would buy it, three might
buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Mrs. Wright's, Earthgrain and Columbo but
they all scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Shelley Handler,
consultant and food writer; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All
Seasons, San Francisco; Roland Passot, chef-owner of La Folie in
San Francisco and left Bank in Larkspur and Menlo Park; and Kirk
Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are
tasted blind. &UR;  &QL;  &LR;

`BOSTON MARRIAGE': VICTORIAN WOMEN FROM MAMET 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Move aside boys, with your gutter talk and
con games and slovenly ways. It's girls' night out in Mametville, a
time to give the other sex a chance to strut and fret its hour upon
the stage. And don't expect a gaggle of tough broads with
machine-gun mouths, either. These ladies are refined; they hang out
in drawing rooms. And believe it or not, they talk as pretty as
anyone out of Oscar Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother checking the credits in your program. The author
and director of ``Boston Marriage,'' the strictly feminine,
Victorian-style comedy of manners at the Hasty Pudding Theater
here, is indeed David Mamet, the man who gave the world the sweaty,
macho bumblers and back stabbers of ``American Buffalo,''
``Glengarry Glen Ross'' and ``Speed-the-Plow.''
</P>
<P>
   As though in nose-thumbing response to critics who claim this
razor-witted writer doesn't give his female characters the time of
day, Mamet has devised a filigree work that is, on the surface, the
reverse image of ``American Buffalo,'' the play that made his
reputation. The characters, once again, are a mere but extremely
verbal few. And they again are conspiring ineptly to perpetuate a
scam of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Here, however, the play's three inhabitants are not only all
women but, in the case of two of them, women who have no use for
men, except economically. Like so many of Mamet's works, ``Boston
Marriage,'' a production of the American Repertory Theater,
presents a world hermetically sealed by its dense language. But the
ripe street vernacular of early Mamet has been replaced by perfumed
locutions of improbable archness. Well, mostly anyway. Obscenities
explode every so often, rather like stink bombs at a garden party.
</P>
<P>
   As a writer Mamet has always been a bit of a showoff, and in
``Boston Marriage'' he is flamboyantly exhibiting his command of
Wildean artifice, which he sends up even as he precisely follows
its rules. It is as though a football player had decided to dance
in the ballet, pointing out as he soars through grands jetes that
the skills of the two disciplines are not all that dissimilar.
</P>
<P>
   The results are, from time to time, devastatingly funny. And the
work is truly blessed by its actresses, Felicity Huffman, Mary
McCann and Rebecca Pidgeon, all of whom have memorably worked with
Mamet (Ms. Pidgeon is also his wife) and give impeccably
disciplined comic performances here.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, ``Boston Marriage'' feels like a parlor
trick that is performed, with slight variations, over the course of
an entire evening. It is an exceptionally clever exercise, a
pastiche carried out with knowing and subversive detail.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a distancing air of contempt to the proceedings, a
faint disdain for the emptiness of posturing estheticism. Here the
characters are never much more than their rhetorical flourishes. As
a half-hour sketch ``Boston Marriage'' could be smashingly
effective. As a two-hour play it starts to look anorexic.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase of the play's title is an old-fashioned term for two
women who live together, possibly as lovers, and the comedy follows
the route to such a union. Anna (Ms. Huffman), is an elegant and
worldly sort who, though the mistress of a rich man, is really in
love with her younger protegee, Claire (Ms. Pidgeon).
</P>
<P>
   Claire, alas, has given her heart elsewhere, and she hopes to
enlist Anna's cooperation in her seduction of the young woman, whom
she has invited to Anna's house. A tangle of coincidence-woven
complications arises; Anna and Claire plot feverishly and
ridiculously to escape it with a scheme that brings to mind Mamet's
early play ``The Shawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Observing all this with bewilderment is Anna's Scottish parlor
maid, Catherine (Ms. McCann), whose name and nationality Anna can
never get right, in what turns out to be the play's funniest
running joke.
</P>
<P>
   This is all charted through fencing-match banter and elaborately
woven tropes that show a perfect satiric ear for late-19th-century
literature, plump with melodramatic invocations and Pre-Raphaelite
and biblical imagery. Mamet's upper-class women can't resist the
temptation to embroider on a metaphor, even when it means
forestalling the contrastingly plain-spoken Catherine's delivery of
essential news.
</P>
<P>
   Anna, for example, sardonically speaks of love as that thing
``which like the sea, which like religion and expensive jewelry,
conquers all.'' When she suggests serving Claire's new friend a
freshly baked pie (``Stress cannot exist in the presence of a
pie''), Claire answers: ``I am concocting a seduction. I do not
require a pastry chef.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Some of these lines sound like unmediated echoes
of ``The Importance of Being Earnest.'' Others have an explicitly
erotic content that Wilde could never have gotten away with. (``Can
you not conceive of a world above your waist?'') And every so often
Anna's and Catherine's fine webs of words are torn by descents into
vulgarity and name-calling. (``You whore.'' ``You pagan slut.'')
</P>
<P>
   A lot of this actually isn't so different from the work of many
downtown drag artists in Manhattan. In some ways it's close to what
Charles Ludlam was doing several decades ago with Theater of the
Ridiculous productions that wallowed in the conventions of period
genres even when making fun of them.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet, however, keeps a crisp intellectual distance from his
characters, a feeling underscored by the watery, Yellow Book
prettiness of the set, nicely designed by Sharon Kaitz and J.
Michael Griggs, and the use of music-hall-style signs on an easel
to herald scenes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the play is meticulous in carrying out its absurd twists
of plot, that's not what holds your attention. Instead, it is
seeing whether Mamet can keep topping himself with his
self-imploding preciousness. In the long run he cannot. What is
appealing in ``Boston Marriage'' registers early and then outstays
its welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The actresses, it should be noted, remain entertainingly stylish
throughout. Ms. Huffman (the star of ``Sports Night'' on
television) and Ms. Pidgeon look ravishingly brittle in Harriet
Voyt's wasp-waisted costumes, and their delivery exactly matches
their appearance. They are especially charming when their
characters are derailed from their trains of thought. And Ms.
McCann's Catherine is a lovely, earthy foil to the others'
affectations, while still finding sport in the parody elements of
the folk-wisdom-spouting servant.
</P>
<P>
   It should also be pointed out that Mamet has been expanding
beyond the territory traditionally defined as Mametesque for years
now. As a screenwriter he has brought rejuvenating life to
everything from the all-American cops and robbers of ``The
Untouchables'' to legal drama according to Terence Rattigan in the
current ``Winslow Boy.'' And in his recent plays ``The Cryptogram''
and ``The Old Neighborhood,'' he has brought a new, searingly
personal emotional charge to his work.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Boston Marriage'' he demonstrates anew his technical
virtuosity and flexibility. But it's a minor detour for this
indisputably major playwright, a clever, mildly diverting round of
charades in a career of far more involving dramatic games.
</P>

EVERY YEAR, 3 MILLION AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE ATTACKED BY MAN'S BEST
FRIEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When his family's pit bull destroyed the face of a 2-year-old
Tulsa, Okla., boy last fall, the entire plastic surgery department
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas
worked in shifts night and day for 39 hours on the toddler's
initial reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   His cheeks, nose, lower eyelids, facial flesh and muscles had
been torn away. Only his eyes and forehead remained when the
marathon surgery began.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, many of the same doctors were involved in
reattaching the entire scalp and rebuilding the delicate back of
the neck of a 3-year-old Austin boy, assaulted by a Rottweiler.
</P>
<P>
   Both children survived and are doing well, although they face
numerous follow-up surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   But the reconstructive surgeons who spend hours cutting,
clipping, moving skin and muscle around, reconnecting nerves and
blood vessels, and sewing children back together after savage dog
attacks don't want to talk about the surgical skills involved.
</P>
<P>
   They want to talk about dog-bite prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are truly devastating injuries for the children
involved,'' says Dr. Bill Adams, assistant professor of plastic
surgery at UT Southwestern. ``In the fortunate cases, we can repair
the injuries. However, they take multiple procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is a significant portion of the 3 million
dog attacks on children each year could be prevented with
education. That's definitely the message we want to convey,'' Adams
says.
</P>
<P>
   Adams led the surgical team that reattached the scalp sheared
off by the Rottweiler and was part of the team that rebuilt the
face devastated by the pit bull. Both children were treated at
Children's Medical Center of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two recent cases are the most spectacular, but I
probably have been involved with at least 30 people attacked by
dogs in the last nine years. At least five required extensive
multiple reconstructive procedures,'' Adams says. ``If we could
prevent just one, it would be worth any effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, 4.7 million people are bitten by dogs in this
country; 800,000 require medical treatment, and about 65 percent of
those who end up in hospital emergency rooms are young children,
according to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control,
part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995-1996, there were at least 25 deaths from dog attacks _
20 of them children, the most recent CDC statistics show. Estimates
could be low by as much as 25 percent because of incomplete
information on death certificates, CDC officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1979 and 1996, there were 304 fatalities from dog
bites reported in the United States,'' says Dr. Charles Ginsburg,
chairman of pediatrics at UT Southwestern. ``The breeds of dog
involved in the attacks on children vary; however, Rottweilers, pit
bulls and German shepherds account for more than 50 percent of all
fatal bite-related injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of dogs that attack children belong to a friend
or family member of the child and aren't strays,'' Adams says.
</P>
<P>
   Adams also points out that some breeds are notorious for vicious
attacks. Chows, pit bulls, Rottweilers and Doberman pinschers
shouldn't be around children at all, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should always monitor children when they are around
dogs, particularly dogs they don't know, and family pets should be
trained when they are very young to be more socialized,'' Adams
says.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent dog-bite tragedies, the National Center for Injury
Prevention and Control recommends:
</P>
<P>
   _Realistically evaluate your environment and lifestyle before
buying or adopting a dog. Dogs with histories of aggression are
inappropriate in households with children.
</P>
<P>
   _Be sensitive to cues that a child is fearful or apprehensive
and delay acquiring a dog until a child is comfortable with it.
</P>
<P>
   _Spend time with a dog before buying or adopting one. Use extra
caution when bringing a dog into a home with an infant or toddler.
</P>
<P>
   _Spay or neuter any family pet dog to reduce any aggressive
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   _Never leave an infant or young child alone with any dog.
</P>
<P>
   _Properly socialize and train any dog entering the household.
</P>
<P>
   _Immediately seek professional advice from a veterinarian or
animal behaviorist if a dog develops aggressive or undesirable
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   _Do not play aggressive games or wrestle with a dog.
</P>
<P>
   _Never disturb a dog that is sleeping, eating or caring for
puppies.
</P>
<P>
   _Do not pet a dog without allowing it to see you and sniff you
first.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   WHAT EVERY CHILD SHOULD KNOW ABOUT DOG BITES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most dog bites can be avoided, says Kelly Westbrook, education
officer for Fort Worth Animal Control, who often visits schools
with this message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always tell people the most important thing is to stay away
from stray animals. Never approach a dog or cat that you don't
know,'' Westbrook says. If one approaches you, stop, stand still
and watch it. Don't run. Dogs like to chase moving objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Other safety tips Westbrook shares with children include:
</P>
<P>
   _Keep your eyes on the dog, but do not make eye contact with it.
</P>
<P>
   _Talk softly and gently and try to calm it down. Just say things
like, ``It's OK, take it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   _Keep the animal in front of you and slowly back up out of the
dog's territory, if possible.
</P>
<P>
   _If you are riding a bike and a dog starts chasing you, stop,
dismount on the side opposite the dog, keeping the bike between you
and the dog while you talk softly and walk away from it.
</P>
<P>
   _Go tell an adult as soon as possible so that the loose dog can
be picked up by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   _If you are attacked, curl up with your hands locked behind your
neck and your arms and elbows up around your face _ like the duck
and cover positions taught for tornado drills.
</P>
<P>
   _If you are bitten by an animal of any kind _ dog, cat or wild
animal _ tell an adult immediately. State law requires that the
animal be quarantined and watched to make certain it is not rabid.
</P>

WANTED: DIRECTOR FOR ALBANY'S OLD JAIL ART CENTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, Texas _ The Old Jail Art Center has added a unique twist
to its profile of candidates for the next museum director's job:
It's looking for an executive who can talk cattle as well as art.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in the historic cattle and oil town of Albany _ about
an hour east of Abilene _ the Old Jail has been without an
executive director since January, when Joeliene Magoto resigned to
accept a post that would take her closer to her family in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it sometimes seems as if the Old Jail Art Center
could run on its own.
</P>
<P>
   It enjoys national exposure. Word has spread via television with
a segment on ``CBS Sunday Morning'' and in a variety of popular
publications.
</P>
<P>
   American and European tourists have responded favorably.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's professionalism is praised by art administrators
ranging from Jack Nokes, president of the Texas Association of
Museums, to Ted Pillsbury, independent consultant and former
director of the Kimbell Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Jail is almost an aberration,'' Nokes says. ``It's
such a fine gem of a museum in such a small community.''
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury points to the museum's wealth of support from patrons
throughout its region. The Old Jail is ``a community organization
in the best sense,'' he says. ``Everyone is encouraged to take part
in it, to take responsibility for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Its collection is solidly based on key groups of pre-Columbian
ceramics, Tang Dynasty tomb figures, modernist works by European
and American artists, and works by Texas artists, primarily of the
20th century. Several of the museum's key holdings _ including an
exquisite Calder mobile and a late painting by Paul Klee _ were
featured in the recent exhibition ``Bill Bomar: The Collector and
the Artist.'' Bomar, who died in 1991, and his cousin Reilly Nail
co-founded the Old Jail in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The original jail building _ which has been augmented by two
modern additions _ is a national landmark, built in 1877 of
hand-hewed local limestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a $2 million endowment and a financially prudent
board,'' Nail adds. ``And we just completed a capital campaign of
about $3.2 million in six months for the new building and its
endowment.''
</P>
<P>
   And the museum's four full-time staff members, board of 12
trustees and host of volunteers are precisely focused and
passionately dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   But as gracefully as the Old Jail flew on autopilot, Nail is
adamant about its need for a new executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing else, we need a director in order to keep our
accreditation,'' he says. Not to mention its standing as a serious
organization: The Old Jail receives unqualified support from
Albany's substantial population of wealthy, Ivy League-educated
citizens. Unmediated by professional administration, that kind of
enthusiasm can turn an institution into a patrons' plaything.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the last thing we want,'' Nail says.
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling block is the pay scale, which is in the
neighborhood of $30,000-$35,000, Nail says. It's the kind of
compensation that would only be attractive to someone starting out
(as Magoto was) or coming to the end of a career _ in other words,
someone motivated by interests other than income.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a point where we've gotten practically nowhere with
this search,'' Nail says. ``We're looking at graduate programs in
arts administration. We have people of some importance out looking
for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not desperate,'' he adds. ``But we're feeling frustrated
_ and that's frustrated in italics.''
</P>
<P>
   So if patience is one of your virtues and you know a polled
Hereford from a horned, then the Old Jail Art Center may have an
offer you can't resist.

GROOMING OF YOUNG MEN IS A MYSTERY TO BE PONDERED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Son, I am going to take you to get a haircut today AND wait,
wait, wait a minute before you start looking for someplace to hide.
I promise on your turtle's grave that I will not let them put fire
on your neck.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the script, and you have to say it just like that or the
boy will not cooperate. He hates to go to the barber. He has always
disliked the whole process of grooming. When he was younger, I
thought his fear was a result of the noise from the clippers and
the fear of falling off that high stool. Even with arm rests and a
booster seat, those barber's chairs are not really designed for
small children.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a couple of youngsters squirm their way into a ``great
fall'' like Humpty Dumpty, and it wasn't a pretty sight. I guess
that's why the barbers put that ``Stone Cold Steve Austin choke
hold'' on the back of their necks while they use the other hand to
maneuver the clippers over the boys' scalps.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until he began to express himself in complete
sentences that I learned the true reason for my son's timidity. He
finally told me, ``He puts fire on my neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not good.
</P>
<P>
   I admit that I often glance through magazines or watch
television while my son gets a trim but I didn't think that I was
looking away long enough for someone to abuse him. Fire on his
neck? For goodness' sake, how could that be?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the next time his hairline disappeared into his shirt
collar, I bribed him into going to the barber. I promised him a big
cookie from the mall and that I would absolutely, positively do
harm to anyone who tried to put fire on his sweet little neck.
</P>
<P>
   Things were going well with the scissors and the clippers so my
mind wandered a bit. I found myself wondering about my own big
cookie at the mall when I heard my son screaming, ``No! No! It's
the fire!''
</P>
<P>
   I glanced up to find the barber attempting to apply Sea Breeze
to my son's neck. He uses it as an antiseptic, I guess, but as far
as my boy was concerned, it was fire on his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the men in the barbershop got a kick out of that one. I
told the barber to skip the Sea Breeze. I'd take care of his neck
at home with some iodine or something.
</P>
<P>
   However, I forgot to tell Dad about the fire. A couple of weeks
ago, he told my son that he was going to take him to the barber but
he failed to issue the cease-fire order. In a panic, my son took
his father's mustache trimmer and tried to cut his own hair. It
must not have gone well because then he asked his brother to take
my husband's clippers and shave all of his hair off.
</P>
<P>
   The haircut wasn't so bad, but the 2-inch edge-up pushed his
hairline back to his ears. Dad was not pleased. I laughed _
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Being afraid of Sea Breeze doesn't measure high on Dad's macho
meter. Oh well.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'm pleased with what he did, but for the moment, my
bald boy is happy. That's good enough for today. Tomorrow, we'll
put out the fire.
</P>

LEARNING TO KEEP AN OPEN HEART, MIND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the winter of 1973, my mother died of a massive heart attack.
I was 15. She was 43.
</P>
<P>
   I always figured my mother died before her time, and without
time for her or those whom she loved to prepare for her passing.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 years later, I can't help but wonder if it was a
sick heart that killed her or simply a lonely and unhappy one. If
nothing else, I think my mother was just tired, the way you get
when it seems that for every move forward you make, there are two
or three in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Watching her, listening to her talk with friends, I learned
there was a lot of evil in this world. I also learned a fantastic
kindness existed as well.
</P>
<P>
   And so in a lot of ways, my mother's life explains my unfailing
compassion for people and my powerful commitment to try and help
whomever I can.
</P>
<P>
   I remember this as I sit in a waiting room overflowing with
other mothers, mostly teen-agers so ripe with life they look as if
they might burst. Because she has no one else, I am here with a
pregnant 17-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   With two children and one on the way, you'd think she were fully
grown but she looks and sounds like a scared kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I didn't want to,'' she said, explaining her
predicament. ``I told him I didn't want to get pregnant again. I
just went on and did it because I didn't want him to be mad at
me.''
</P>
<P>
   I want to scold her but I don't think that would do any good. I
was not a pregnant teen, but I know what it is to be vulnerable and
to struggle to cope in a world that you can't always control.
</P>
<P>
   While we made small talk, I remember an e-mail from a reader
named Kathleen and I wonder what she'd make of this scene. Would
she approve of my being here or would she accuse me of helping
perpetuate teen-age pregnancy? Would she accuse me of weakening
this young woman further because I dare to try to understand her,
to want to help her?
</P>
<P>
   But let me back up.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen sent me the e-mail two weeks ago after I wrote a column
questioning the motives of some white downtown businessmen who have
taken a sudden interest in Nash Elementary School, which has a
predominantly minority enrollment. Anything that improves the
quality of our schools should be applauded, but I wondered whether
the businessmen were motivated because kids who will be attending
Nash and living in the new apartments in downtown Fort Worth will
most likely be white.
</P>
<P>
   This seemed to set Kathleen off. In her estimation, it proved my
``disdain'' for whites and my willingness to continue to demean
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen went on to say that she ``just plain does not have time
to seek out things to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, am left wondering who needs me more, a
teen-age girl awaiting the birth of her third child with no means
of caring for them, or a woman too busy to care about anyone but
her own?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people whose children attend Nash Elementary are the
appropriate people to worry about their children,'' she wrote. ``I
am not going to accept the blame for what goes on there just
because I'm white.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen says she's a lawyer, but her words make me realize how
removed law and perception can be from the reality of the daily
struggle occurring in people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in that waiting room the other day, I felt like giving
up. Then in the cold company of despair, my faith and the memory of
my mother offered me hope.
</P>
<P>
   Both have taught me that with an open heart, friendship and
understanding can relieve an abundance of suffering. Not just in
words, but in deeds.

 &HT;    GATES: NOTHING TO FEAR FROM ANTITRUST LAWS
 &HT;    580&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates lauded ``the light
hand of government in the technology area'' Tuesday as being behind
``the incredible success of this industry in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Testifying to a Joint Economic Committee hearing on high
technology, Gates spurned a bid from Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., to
propose specific reforms in the nation's antitrust laws to meet the
needs of an increasingly networked society.
</P>
<P>
   As Gates spoke, Microsoft, the world's largest software firm,
remained embroiled in an antitrust case brought by the Justice
Department and 19 states that is being heard a few blocks away from
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates suggested that he wasn't worried about the outcome of
the trial, which was in recess Tuesday, telling the panel:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people who (would) dive into that, but I think
the laws as they are currently written are fine. Certainly
everything that's gone on in the technology industry has come about
because of things like integrating new features in is one of the
freedoms that all companies have.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates testified a few blocks from the federal courthouse where
his company is bitterly disputing the government's sweeping
antitrust allegations. While he has not testified in the trial,
those seated in the courtroom have watched hours of videotape in
which Gates was questioned by government lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   His upbeat testimony in Congress over the fresh wonders of
technology bore scant resemblance to his grudging videotaped
testimony last summer. And the lawmakers responded with uniform
praise, in contrast to the open scorn his deposition elicited from
antitrust prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Gates also responded to questions from three groups of high
school and college students from around the country via a
videoconference link that also could be viewed on the Internet. But
the jerky images underscored the fact that Gates's vision of ``a
new era (able to) deliver the power of the information age to
anyone, anywhere and anytime'' remained a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   In also noting both the so-called Y2K computer glitch and the
recent outbreak of computer virus assaults against Microsoft
products, Gates said: ``We need to design our systems to be far
more resilient against these attacks. We need to get on top of
these problems in advance to minimize the disruption these things
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his appearance, the Senate voted 62-37 to approve
legislation to protect companies against lawsuits stemming from the
Y2K computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Gates dismissed a warning from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, delivered Monday before the same panel, that the current
era of technology-driven productivity growth could not be sustained
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will absolutely see productivity increases coming out of
this technology for many, many years to come. We are very much at
the beginning of what can be done with these devices,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gates allowed that technology stocks could fluctuate in
value, ``underneath that, the actual efficiency and benefit for
consumers will continue to advance year by year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, a Harvard dropout whose stock holdings in Microsoft make
him the world's wealthiest man, singled out the role of education
in fostering the nation's high-tech success rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing the government has done well is support higher
education,'' he said. ``The strength of our universities in
allowing these advances to take place here can't be overstated.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Gates was treated on Capitol Hill with a deference and
a security umbrella usually reserved for heads of state, he could
not escape controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Federation of America filed a statement with the
committee accusing Microsoft of ``charging monopoly prices for its
operating system, resulting in consumer overcharges of tens of
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And, as he spoke, a group of young people stood against the wall
of the hearing room wearing white T-shirts with such messages as
``Bust the Trust'' and ``Microsoft-Intel: Corporate predators
versus Democracy.''

It's looking for an executive who can talk cattle as well as art.
Situated in the historic cattle and oil town of Albany _ about an
hour east of Abilene _ the Old Jail has been without an executive
director since January, when Joeliene Magoto resigned to accept a
post that would take her closer to her family in Ohio. By JANET

KOREAN FIREFIGHT AT SEA TURNS INTO WAR OF WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ An early morning firefight Tuesday in disputed waters in
the Yellow Sea receded into a verbal clash, as North Korea demanded
an apology and lashed out at South Korea for sinking one of its
warships.
</P>
<P>
   Each side contended that the other fired first. But the result
is not disputed. South Korean ships fired on and hit a North Korean
torpedo boat, causing it to catch fire and sink. All 17 North
Koreans aboard were killed, said the South Korean state-owned
Yonhap News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Five North Korean patrol boats were also damaged in the fight,
possibly the fiercest naval clash since the Korean War ended in
1953. One South Korean boat suffered mild damage, and no South
Koreans were seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is sure to put further strains on North Korea's
relations with the South and with the rest of the world. It also
occurs at an awkward moment as North Korea considers a United
States plan, devised by former Defense Secretary William Perry,
that could lead to a significant expansion of relations between
North Korea and the West, in exchange for concessions including an
agreement that the North end its long-range missile program.
</P>
<P>
   The clash may also be a setback for South Korean President Kim
Dae Jung, who has been pushing his ``sunshine policy'' of
engagement with the North. The South Korean government has
advocated stronger business ties and was instrumental in helping
the Hyundai Corp. set up special tours to the scenic Mount Kumgang
area in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Tours leave virtually every day, and there were scores of
tourists in North Korea, along with thousands of South Korean
business executives, when the gun battle occurred Tuesday. As South
Korean government officials tried to ensure the safety of its
citizens currently in the North, the two sides exchanged warnings
and threats, each blaming the other for the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We interpret North Korea's armed provocation as a very
significant act,'' said Hwang Won Tak, Kim's top security advisor.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts said that while there were still risks of more
skirmishes, Tuesday's confrontation was not likely to intensify.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of today's incident escalating into a full-scale
battle is low,'' an analyst at the Korea Institute for Defense
Analyses, Suh Choo Suk, said. ``The North merely wanted to turn the
area into disputed territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Others warned that there were still risks of miscalculation and
the situation was volatile.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more serious than before,'' said a South Korean
government official who works on North Korean matters and refused
to be identified by name. ``It's a buffer zone, they are fighting
with each other and there are battle ships. This is how wars
begin.''
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation began Monday of last week, when North Korean
naval vessels escorted fishing boats south of the ``northern limit
line,'' the customary line of demarcation between the two Koreas in
the Yellow Sea. The North does not recognize the line and
periodically sends ships south of it, but they normally retreat
when ordered back by South Korean patrol boats.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the North Korean vessels held their ground,
and on Friday the South began to ram the North Korean boats to
drive them north again. Tuesday was the first time there was
gunfire, however. South Korean officials say that one of its
high-speed patrol boats fired 76 millimeter rounds at the North
Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   There were about 10 North Korean vessels in the confrontation,
and by night time, they had all returned to their side of the line,
according to the Yonhap News Agency. It said that two North Korean
boats remained only about a mile north of the line, however.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's official news agency said there were a dozen South
Korean warships in Tuesday's clash and that they fired some 150
shells and more than 7,000 machine-gun bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Talks were held Tuesday at the border village of Panmunjom
between North Korea and the U.N. Command, beginning just moments
after news of the sinking North Korean ship reached negotiators.
The United Nations requested that both sides withdraw their ships
from the disputed waters, but no agreement was reached and
discussions ended after 90 minutes without any plans to resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South Koreans must immediately apologize for the serious
consequences of their armed provocations,'' said a statement issued
by the North Korea news agency. ``They must not run amok, clearly
mindful that if military provocations are continued, they will meet
a thousand-fold retaliatory blow.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash took place in a good crab fishing area, at the height
of the crab season, which is why North Korean fishing boats were in
the area. North Korea has been plagued by widespread famine, and it
particularly values crabs because it can export them for hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea is sending batches of fertilizer to North Korea, as
a condition for two-way talks that are expected to take place in
Beijing on June 21. Tuesday, however, the South Korean government
said that one ship with about 14,000 tons of fertilizer, or 14
percent of the agreed-upon amount, turned back toward the South
until its safety could be assured.
</P>
<P>
   Hwang Dong-kyu, a spokesman for the South Korean Joint Chief of
Staff, said that the United States was helping South Korea
formulate measures to respond to North Korea.

CHECKING IN WITH JERRY GARCIA FROM THE HEREAFTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES SULLIVAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jerry Garcia sends his fond regards.
</P>
<P>
   Life in the hereafter, he reports, is bliss. ``To be truly free
to express love,'' he says, ``is to be one with All That Is.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his former Grateful Dead band mate Bob Weir: ``Ask him to
drink more mineral water.''
</P>
<P>
   Mineral water, see, cleanses the synapses for better telepathic
reception. That's how Wendy Weir, Bob's sister, says she has been
contacting Garcia since his death in August 1995. The results of
their correspondence _ ``In the Spirit: Conversations With the
Spirit of Jerry Garcia'' (Harmony; $24) _ will be published later
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Contacting Jerry (or, more specifically, ``Jerry's Oversoul'')
was the easy part, Weir says. ``The hard part was, do I really put
myself on the line and say, `This is my experience, this is my
reality'? Because people can say, `Oh, you're nuts.'''
</P>
<P>
   A former savings and loan executive who says she was always a
``good little girl,'' the 49-year-old Weir suggests none of the
nutty qualities one might expect of the author of this peculiar
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is your experience,'' she reasons, ``so what you're
talking about is true, for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Spirit'' grew out of a series of personal revelations.
Weir first recognized her psychic powers in 1971, after both her
parents died of cancer within weeks of each other.
</P>
<P>
   But almost two decades passed before she devoted herself to her
muses _ psychic study, painting and environmental education. Her
inspiration came from as good a place as any: the spirit of her
brother Bob's dead dog, Otis.
</P>
<P>
   On the first anniversary of the beloved elkhound's death, Weir
writes, Otis insisted that she paint his portrait for Bob. ``Otis,
you're crazy!'' she remembers responding.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was a turning point for Weir. Soon she began
studying energetic and ``psychomotoric'' healing. In 1991, she and
Bob collaborated on the award-winning book-and-cassette package
``Panther Dreams: A Story of the African Rainforest,'' an
educational tool for kids. ``Baru Bay: Australia'' followed in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   When Garcia died, Bob Weir asked his sister to ``check in on''
the late guitarist, as she had done with Otis, the Dead's
keyboardist Brent Mydland and others close to the Weirs.
</P>
<P>
   Other than his encouragement, her brother declined to be
involved in the book, she says. ``He's too close (to the subject),
though he doesn't say that. He says he doesn't want to profit from
Jerry's friendship monetarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a very close, very deep relationship with Jerry.
Everyone that knew Jerry still misses him, and that doesn't go
away.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The author first met the young Garcia at the Weir household in
Atherton, Calif., south of San Francisco, where the jug band that
would become the Dead often rehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always the little sister,'' she says. ``It was a real
family relationship.'' In the book Jerry's Oversoul addresses her
as ``little one.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years she has had little interest in the band's music,
though she has gone to plenty of shows. ``I've got to be honest, I
don't think I have ever sat out in the audience through one whole
show in my whole life.'' She keeps the band's recorded output as
``a memento, or a file. I don't sit down and listen to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, the spirit of the avuncular Garcia speaks in lofty
New Age psychobabble. ``It is only natural,'' he says, ``to be
drawn to the lower vibrations as represented in our first, second
and third chakras or energy vortices, but it is not our purpose to
stay stuck there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry speaks to everyone in a way they can relate to him,''
Weir explains. ``I can only write down and experience what I am.
When he comes through me, that's what I experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deadheads, she says, have an important message to offer.
``They've had this bad rap all these years for being drugged-out
hippies. No one has seen the healing side, the incredible love and
joy they share, as being very healing. It's a wonderful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And Garcia, of course, is the ultimate spiritual leader. ``He's
the great Papa Bear figure,'' she says.

   TRAVEL-LASTMINUTE _ The best kind of travel is the last-minute
kind, booked online. At least that's what the Atlanta founders of
LastMinuteTravel.com soon will be trying to convince travelers
across the nation. Their fledgling web site _ now in a limited
``sneak preview'' mode _ links spur-of-the-moment travelers with

   COCACOLA-EUROPE _ ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co.'s drinks were pulled
from shelves in Luxembourg and parts of France and the Netherlands
as a health scare that began in Belgium spread across Europe, the
soft-drink maker's second-biggest market. Coca-Cola today said it
traced the contamination that sickened consumers to the carbon
dioxide used in bottles produced in a plant in Antwerp, Belgium,
and fungicide found on the outside of cans produced at a plant in
Dunkirk, France. Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is 42 percent owned
by Coca-Cola, today said it's recalling all Coke products produced
in Belgium and distributed to the Netherlands. France today banned
a batch of drinks produced at the plant in Dunkirk, Reuters said.
And Luxembourg banned the sale of all Coca-Cola products, AFP
reported, citing a government statement. (Unger, Atlanta

<P>
   RETIREMENT_SURVEY _ATLANTA _ Asian-Americans have more
confidence than the general population that they can retire
comfortably _ and more reason to think so. Blacks and Hispanics are
far behind on both counts, according to the 1999 Retirement
Confidence Survey. It was released Tuesday by two non-profit
agencies and a polling company. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   NETBANK-GROWTH _ Net.B(at)nk announced it now has 35,000
accounts, twice as many as at the start of 1999. The company also
added an electronic safety deposit box feature to its online
banking offerings. The story updates the news on them and talks to
two analysts who recently initiated coverage. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   CPI-STOCKS _ Marvin Sherman doesn't need today's Consumer Price
Index report to tell him the cost of living is going up. ``My
haircut just went up,'' he said. Still, Wall Street will pay a lot
of attention to the CPI, because its the last inflation report
before the Federal Reserve meets to consider raising interest
rates. Ahead of the report, stocks rose in early trading, with the
Dow up 61 points and the Nasdaq 18. With chart showing CPI trend.
(McNaughton, Cox News Service). 14.

<P>
   CABLE-SEX _ Some of the leading executives at top entertainment
companies striking back at critics. Labeled ``obscene'' the
criticisms of their product. Sumner Redstone says ``sex is good,
violence is bad.'' Levin also defended. Both said they couldn't
tell what's obscene or what is art until the public has a chance to
see it. Being grilled by Jeff Greenfield, veteran TV correspondent.
(Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WEB-MD _ What is the story with WebMD and the abrupt departure
of its president, Jay Gilbertson? When he was co-prez of HBOC, he
was responsible for HBOC's investment in WebMD, pumping in cash to
WebMD when it was getting underway. Then he gave WebMD cachet on
Wall Street by abandoning HBO leaping to take the helm. Meanwhile,
HBOC is under investigation for financial troubles under JG's
regime. And now WebMD is merging with Healtheon in a multi-billion
deal but JG is out. Is this a castle that is built in the air?

<P>
   HDEPOT-SUIT _ Home Depot has filed a lawsuit against James
Inglis, a former board director, for stealing trade secrets and
unfairly recruiting top-level employees in connection with a new
business venture by Inglis that's similar to Expo. Inglis, former
chief operating officer of floor-covering retailer Maxim Group, was
executive vice president of Depot and was ``instrumental in the
development'' of Expo until May 1996. Three other defendants are
named, all former employees of Home Depot who have been recruited
by Inglis. Home Depot alleges that they have placed the company's
``investment in its Expo Design Center Division and its future
business in jeopardy.'' In recent months, Home Depot has been
particularly vocal about how proud it is of the Expo concept, which
has been developing for nine years. Atlanta is set to get its
second Expo in November. (Bond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

</P>
<P>
   CAU-DONATE _ ATLANTA _Clark Atanta University has received a $1
million grant from the Lilly Endowment/United Negro College Fund to
enhance its computer technology program and develop a distance
learning center. The historically black college was one of several
that received part of the $41.7 million grant, the largest single
grant in the 61-year history of the endowment. (Joyner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-LOANS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ After the caps and gowns have
been returned, the parties thrown and the rejection letters thrown
away, the real business of being a would-be college student begins.
Call it Economics 101: Footing the Bill. The college-bound most
likely have become experts in their own right in the world of
student loans. But there's a whole new crop _ students and parents
_ who haven't a clue where to turn. If you're headed to college in
the fall and haven't started looking into student loans at all,
you're awfully late, but not without hope. (Townsend, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.

<P>
   MONEYTALK _ Long-term investing is more like staying on a
healthful diet _ it goes on forever, and it requires persistent
effort. For many people, the first step is the hardest. It is the
one in which you start saving some of your money every payday. Some
tips on making investments less painful. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   USENET-TAKEOVER _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The Usenet forum was for owners
of Chia pets, those ceramic animals from mail-order TV. And there
in the list of subjects was a query from someone desperate to keep
her dog from chasing cars. A chia dog that chases cars? That would
be worth sending a photographer, if those TV prowl vans don't beat
us to it. And there was another pottery-pet question asking whether
a mother cat would adopt a kitten from someone else's litter. And
some advice on controlling fleas (another startling problem,
considering recent advances in ceramic technology). And someone
complaining that her landlord won't let her keep a ferret.
Wondering why a landlord would object to a pottery ferret, which
after all is no noisier nor destructive to drapes than a pottery
turtle, I had to look. And I found technological kidnapping, right
there in cyberspace. (Stough, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   TRAVEL-LASTMINUTE _ The best kind of travel is the last-minute
kind, booked online. At least that's what the Atlanta founders of
LastMinuteTravel.com soon will be trying to convince travelers
across the nation. Their fledgling web site _ now in a limited
``sneak preview'' mode _ links spur-of-the-moment travelers with
airlines, hotels and other suppliers that have unsold inventory to
unload online. (Thurston, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   COCACOLA-EUROPE _ ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co.'s drinks were pulled
from shelves in Luxembourg and parts of France and the Netherlands
as a health scare that began in Belgium spread across Europe, the
soft-drink maker's second-biggest market. Coca-Cola today said it
traced the contamination that sickened consumers to the carbon
dioxide used in bottles produced in a plant in Antwerp, Belgium,
and fungicide found on the outside of cans produced at a plant in
Dunkirk, France. Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is 42 percent owned
by Coca-Cola, today said it's recalling all Coke products produced
in Belgium and distributed to the Netherlands. France today banned
a batch of drinks produced at the plant in Dunkirk, Reuters said.
And Luxembourg banned the sale of all Coca-Cola products, AFP
reported, citing a government statement. (Unger, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   RETIREMENT_SURVEY _ATLANTA _ Asian-Americans have more
confidence than the general population that they can retire
comfortably _ and more reason to think so. Blacks and Hispanics are
far behind on both counts, according to the 1999 Retirement
Confidence Survey. It was released Tuesday by two non-profit
agencies and a polling company. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   NETBANK-GROWTH _ Net.B(at)nk announced it now has 35,000
accounts, twice as many as at the start of 1999. The company also
added an electronic safety deposit box feature to its online
banking offerings. The story updates the news on them and talks to
two analysts who recently initiated coverage. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   CPI-STOCKS _ Marvin Sherman doesn't need today's Consumer Price
Index report to tell him the cost of living is going up. ``My
haircut just went up,'' he said. Still, Wall Street will pay a lot
of attention to the CPI, because its the last inflation report
before the Federal Reserve meets to consider raising interest
rates. Ahead of the report, stocks rose in early trading, with the
Dow up 61 points and the Nasdaq 18. With chart showing CPI trend.
(McNaughton, Cox News Service). 14.

<P>
   CABLE-SEX _ Some of the leading executives at top entertainment
companies striking back at critics. Labeled ``obscene'' the
criticisms of their product. Sumner Redstone says ``sex is good,
violence is bad.'' Levin also defended. Both said they couldn't
tell what's obscene or what is art until the public has a chance to
see it. Being grilled by Jeff Greenfield, veteran TV correspondent.
(Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WEB-MD _ What is the story with WebMD and the abrupt departure
of its president, Jay Gilbertson? When he was co-prez of HBOC, he
was responsible for HBOC's investment in WebMD, pumping in cash to
WebMD when it was getting underway. Then he gave WebMD cachet on
Wall Street by abandoning HBO leaping to take the helm. Meanwhile,
HBOC is under investigation for financial troubles under JG's
regime. And now WebMD is merging with Healtheon in a multi-billion
deal but JG is out. Is this a castle that is built in the air?
(Miller/Kanell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.
</P>
<P>
   HDEPOT-SUIT _ Home Depot has filed a lawsuit against James
Inglis, a former board director, for stealing trade secrets and
unfairly recruiting top-level employees in connection with a new
business venture by Inglis that's similar to Expo. Inglis, former
chief operating officer of floor-covering retailer Maxim Group, was
executive vice president of Depot and was ``instrumental in the
development'' of Expo until May 1996. Three other defendants are
named, all former employees of Home Depot who have been recruited
by Inglis. Home Depot alleges that they have placed the company's
``investment in its Expo Design Center Division and its future
business in jeopardy.'' In recent months, Home Depot has been
particularly vocal about how proud it is of the Expo concept, which
has been developing for nine years. Atlanta is set to get its
second Expo in November. (Bond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   CAU-DONATE _ ATLANTA _Clark Atanta University has received a $1
million grant from the Lilly Endowment/United Negro College Fund to
enhance its computer technology program and develop a distance
learning center. The historically black college was one of several
that received part of the $41.7 million grant, the largest single
grant in the 61-year history of the endowment. (Joyner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   COLLEGE-LOANS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ After the caps and gowns have
been returned, the parties thrown and the rejection letters thrown
away, the real business of being a would-be college student begins.
Call it Economics 101: Footing the Bill. The college-bound most
likely have become experts in their own right in the world of
student loans. But there's a whole new crop _ students and parents
_ who haven't a clue where to turn. If you're headed to college in
the fall and haven't started looking into student loans at all,
you're awfully late, but not without hope. (Townsend, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.

   MONEYTALK _ Long-term investing is more like staying on a
healthful diet _ it goes on forever, and it requires persistent
effort. For many people, the first step is the hardest. It is the
one in which you start saving some of your money every payday. Some
tips on making investments less painful. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   USENET-TAKEOVER _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The Usenet forum was for owners
of Chia pets, those ceramic animals from mail-order TV. And there
in the list of subjects was a query from someone desperate to keep
her dog from chasing cars. A chia dog that chases cars? That would
be worth sending a photographer, if those TV prowl vans don't beat
us to it. And there was another pottery-pet question asking whether
a mother cat would adopt a kitten from someone else's litter. And
some advice on controlling fleas (another startling problem,
considering recent advances in ceramic technology). And someone
complaining that her landlord won't let her keep a ferret.
Wondering why a landlord would object to a pottery ferret, which
after all is no noisier nor destructive to drapes than a pottery
turtle, I had to look. And I found technological kidnapping, right
there in cyberspace. (Stough, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   KOSOVO-KLA _ STARIE KACANEK, Kosovo _ The KLA flexes its mucle.
Hundreds of Serb civilians, fearing for their lives, fled this town
Tuesday after it was taken over by Kosovo Liberation Army rebels
who discovered a mass grave. The KLA fighters, angered by
eyewitness accounts of how Serb soldiers had executed Kosovar
residents, began firing their weapons in the air and ordered the
Serb residents to leave. About 30 carloads of Serbs soon fled. It
may be the first documented case of ethnic cleansing by ethnic
Albanians and illustrates the difficulty NATO peacekeepers will
have in preventing acts of revenge. And for the first time in a
year, KLA commander Drini was able to come into town, have coffe
and along the way declare that this is the first city that the KLA
controls ``100 percent.'' He said the KLA will cooperate with the
Military-Technical Agreement but are not prepared de-militarize.
The German NATO commanders in the area say that they are not going
to crack down on the rebel fighters at this point.

   KOSOVO-SERBS _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The first phase of the
11-day withdrawal of Serb-led Yugoslav troops from Kosovo province
looked as though it would wrap up right on schedule Tuesday _ with
little incident. It's what the Serb troops are leaving behind
that's causing concern and consternation. Ethnic Albanians are
coming down from the mountains to return to their homes and finding
looted, burned-out husks. They watch as they wait for the Serb
troops to depart, and see them taking their belongings, throwing
appliances out the door, clothes ripped up and their property
defecated on. Developing. (Kunstel, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

   DETAIN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Two years ago, Ralph Richardson
was a small businessman who coached his church soccer team and
dreamed of turning his commercial cleaning firm in suburban Atlanta
into a big success. An unlucky convergence of a new immigration
law, a weekend trip to Haiti and a 7-year-old cocaine-trafficking
charge doomed the 33-year-old immigrant's plans. He's spent the
last 20 months at Krome Detention Center near Miami as a criminally
tainted immigrant, awaiting deportation. Richardson's luck could be
changing. Converging in his favor are a growing dissent over the
1996 immigration law and a favorable June 1 ruling by the U.S.
Supreme Court in his lawsuit, Richardson vs. the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service. (Douthat, Palm Beach Post) 38''. MOVED.

   BLACK-FARMERS _ PAHOKEE, Fla. _ Being a small farmer is hard and
being a small black farmer is nearly impossible. When a crop is
lost, credit is the only way to survive and credit can be hard to
come by. Black farmers for years have struggled with the USDA,
their government loans delayed past planting time or inexplicably
rejected. At last count in 1997, only 18,000 of America's 1.9
million farms were owned by blacks. Over the years, as small farms
collapsed under the weight of competition from mega growers, black
farms perished at nearly twice the rate of white farms. Black
farmers understood why it was so difficult. But it wasn't until
April that the rest of the world learned: A federal class-action
lawsuit initiated by a third generation North Carolina farmer
against the USDA was settled for an estimated $2.25 billion, the
largest civil rights settlement in history Farmers are now
beginning to file claims. (Staletovich, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

investment is worth it. (Gelbart, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

POPE, AILING, CANCELS APPEARANCES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KRAKOW, Poland _ Stunning the 1 million Poles who were waiting
for him in a rain-soaked meadow, Pope John Paul II canceled all his
planned appearances on Tuesday, sick with what the Vatican said was
a temperature of 100.4.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of the evening of June 14, 1999, the Holy Father has had a
slightly raised temperature, likely to be connected with a viral
infection,'' the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said in
a statement shortly after Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican
secretary of state, began saying the morning Mass in the pope's
place. ``Because of this, John Paul II has been advised to cancel
all activities scheduled for Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Valls later said the pope was treated for influenza by
his personal doctor and would stay in bed in the bishop's residence
all day. Navarro-Valls said that it was too soon to determine
whether the pope could proceed with his freshly made plans to stop
in Armenia after Poland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the pope has to obey someone,'' Navarro-Valls said, ``and
in this case it is his doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old pope has canceled Vatican events for health
reasons before, and in 1994 was forced to postpone a trip to the
United States after falling and breaking his thigh bone. In 1985,
he canceled a planned appearance in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope, who is on his 87th foreign trip, has very rarely
failed to show up at a public event abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The news was particularly disappointing to Krakow's residents.
The ancient city, the spiritual capital of Poland, is where the
young Karol Wojtila secretly studied for the priesthood during the
Nazi occupation and where he was the archbishop from 1963 until his
election to become pope in Rome in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   He considers Krakow home and would not easily give up
celebrating Mass there. ``It 's a rather difficult thing for him,''
Navarro-Valls said. ``But there was no other choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mass was covered live by Polish state television. When the
news was announced on the air, a news announcer told viewers ``to
pray for the health of the Holy Father.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Mass had ended, hundreds left early and began
lining up behind police barricades surrounding the bishop's house,
silently praying and craning their heads for signs of activity from
inside the silent yellow building. A white ambulance stood parked
opposite the main entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just waiting, I cannot say for what,'' said Kazimiera
Witek, 48, a social worker in Krakow. ``I don't expect him to
appear. It's better for him to rest.'' Then-Archbishop Wojtila
officiated at her confirmation in 1965, and like so many other
Krakow natives, she feels like she knows him personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to be here and communicate to him that we are
all with him, and let him know that he is not alone,'' she said.
``I hope he can feel our presence.''
</P>
<P>
   She had first heard the news at the Mass, when it was announced
over a loudspeaker. ``It was raining so hard I couldn't hear the
announcement _people whispered it to each other from group to
group,'' she recalled. ``It was such a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, who replaced John Paul II as
archbishop of Krakow, delivered the pope's homily, adding ``Now let
us turn to the archbishop's house and the pope, who at this moment
is praying in a little chapel there while we are here,'' he told
the congregation, who listened silently under a sea of umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   Since he arrived in Poland for a grueling 13-day visit, the
longest stay in Poland of his papacy, the ailing pope, who usually
walks with a cane, has looked tired but has spoken in a firm voice,
often straying from his prepared remarks to make puns and homey
jokes in his native language.
</P>
<P>
   He slipped last Saturday morning and cut his head, requiring
three stitches that the Vatican said were administered by his
personal doctor, Renato Buzzonetti. Asked if the pope's fever were
connected to the fall, Navarro-Valls said, ``absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time the pope has caught the flu, but the
Vatican has never given out detailed information about the exact
state of health of the pope, who never fully recovered from the
1981 assassination attempt. He was operated on in 1992 for a benign
intestinal tumor, and had an appendectomy in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He broke his shoulder in a fall in November 1993 and broke his
thigh bone after slipping in the bathroom in April 1994, postponing
a trip to the United States until October 1995. On Christmas Day of
that year, he suddenly interrupted his traditional blessing,
broadcast live worldwide from Saint Peter's, when he was overcome
by nausea. Last February 3, he canceled his Wednesday general
audience. The Vatican said he had the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, the pope has shown increasing
difficulty walking; and other symptoms, most notably the trembling
of his left hand, have become obvious. Vatican officials say
privately that he is suffering from Parkinson's disease, but the
Vatican has never confirmed it officially. The pope does not like
to be coddled, and on this trip, as on others, has brushed off
aides who try to help him up from a chair.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the pope braved gray skies and chill winds at a
prayer service in Sosnowiec, a mining town in northeast Poland. He
spoke in a firm voice but looked weary. As the Vatican revealed on
Tuesday, he was already running a fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed very, very tired,'' said Tomasz Budzyn, 19, who
worked as a volunteer security aide at the service. ``I noticed
that he seemed almost asleep in his Popemobile.''
</P>
<P>
   Others began worrying late Monday night, when the pope failed to
address waiting crowds at his window, as he has on all other trips.
A local bishop came out and explained that the pope was ``too
tired'' to appear. ``I felt something was wrong, because it is such
a tradition with us,'' said Jagna Sobala, 45, a shop owner. ``He
always checks in with us there.''

DESPITE GAINS BY OPPOSITION, INDONESIAN RACE IS UNCERTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Even as the main opposition party appeared
to be solidly ahead in the slow vote count one week after the
parliamentary election, analysts Tuesday predicted a hard-fought
battle for Indonesia's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer than 50 percent of the votes counted in the June 7
election, the party of Megawati Sukarnoputri maintained a
commanding lead. The governing party, Golkar, hovered between
second and third in the crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   But no party is expected to win a majority and the victor in
last week's vote may not take the big prize, the presidency.
Coalition-building is already under way, and 238 unelected members
are yet to be named to the 700-seat assembly that will choose the
president and will include the newly elected members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The unelected group will comprise 38 members of the military, 65
members of professional and other groups and 135 members of
provincial assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say it's going to be a very tight election
process, which could in turn be potentially very dangerous,'' said
a Western diplomat, commenting on continuing fears of violence
despite the largely peaceful conduct of the campaign and the vote.
</P>
<P>
   A hard fight over the presidency could create a renewed sense of
instability here, said Hidayat Jati, a political analyst at the
Castle Group, a consulting company for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of polarization is less comforting to
investors,'' he said. ``Investors don't have favorites, but they
are looking for a clear winner to limit the risks of instability.
That hope is becoming less of a reality because the margin is not
going to be that big.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The presidential election will be conducted by 700
people behind closed doors. They are not really your average Joe.
They will have different interests and different loyalties.''
</P>
<P>
   One crucial question is whether the presidential vote in the
assembly will be secret. If it is, political analysts say, the
chances of vote-buying will increase along with the chances of an
outcome that does not reflect the popular will.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these steps go smoothly, the electoral timetable itself
invites uncertainty, said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, an adviser to
President B.J. Habibie, at a public forum on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The new parliament is to meet in August, then expand with its
additional members to form an electoral assembly, then choose the
president in November. ``During those three months there will be no
president and that creates a power vacuum,'' Ms. Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pitfalls, Hidayat Jati said, there is reason for
cautious optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, so good,'' he said. ``Each negative fear or concern
that one may have had in this delicate political process has so far
not materialized.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Rain with embedded thunderstorms will douse portions of the
Carolinas and southern Virginia Wednesday as a flow of humid air
rises up and over a slow-moving front draped across the region. The
lifting of the moist air will be augmented later Wednesday
afternoon by a jet stream disturbance passing overhead. As a
result, the rain will turn heavy for a time which will lead to
localized flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered strong thunderstorms will surround the slow-moving
front from southern Alabama to Georgia with some flooding also
likely. Farther south, Florida will stay partly sunny and very
humid. Towering cumulus clouds will spawn isolated afternoon
storms, especially just inland from the coast where developing sea
breeze fronts undercut and lift the sultry air.
</P>
<P>
   The day will dawn clear and chilly across most of the Northeast.
During the afternoon, however, middle and high clouds will streak
eastward from the Ohio Valley, dimming the sunshine across the
region. The waning sunshine will be a harbinger of inclement
weather with rain expected to arrive over the northern Middle
Atlantic and southern New England States Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Moist winds from the east will further moisten upon ascending
the sloping terrain of the west-central Plains, setting the stage
for locally heavy showers and thunderstorms from central New Mexico
to Colorado. Generally dry conditions will cover the remainder of
the West, though isolated thundershowers will form near the higher
peaks of the western Rockies. Searing heat will persist in the
Southwest deserts.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Tiny Target
</P>
<P>
   A tropical storm watch was issued for Bermuda late Monday as
Arlene drifted northwest toward the tiny nation. The tropical storm
came as close as 250 miles to the southeast of Hamilton at
midafternoon on Tuesday with gale force winds only 100 miles off
the eastern shore. Bermuda has a remarkable proclivity to being a
target for tropical storms. Its location in the southwest Atlantic
is near the point where most storms from the tropics make a
sweeping turn back into the open North Atlantic. Fortunately,
Arlene will make this turn before getting any closer to Bermuda on
Wednesday.

SEATTLE MUSEUM TO RETURN LOOTED WORK  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICIA R. LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Seattle Art Museum will return a painting by Matisse to the
heirs of a French Jewish art dealer from whom it was confiscated by
the Nazis in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's board of trustees voted unanimously to return the
painting, ``Odalisque,'' on Monday afternoon, less than a year
after descendants of the prominent dealer Paul Rosenberg filed suit
in federal district court in Seattle to recover the work. The
lawsuit was the first against an American museum concerning
ownership of art looted by Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's decision was based on a report on the painting's
provenance by the Holocaust Art Restitution Project of B'nai
B'rith, which investigates Jewish cultural losses, said Linda
Williams, a museum spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the Matisse was hailed as an important victory on
Tuesday by the Rosenberg family and others involved in claims,
potential and pending, to artworks plundered during World War II
that found their way into American museums. Since last year,
museums have begun reviewing their collections to identify works
stolen by the Nazis and have pledged to resolve claims quickly if
they arise.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Feliciano, author of ``The Lost Museum: the Nazi
Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works of Art,'' said there
were an estimated 20,000 to 100,000 art objects worldwide that the
Nazis stole from Jewish families and whose whereabouts are unknown.
He traced the provenance of ``Odalisque'' for his book, and said
that documents from the 1930s showed that the painting, dating from
in 1927 or 1928, belonged to Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The whereabouts of ``Odalisque'' were unknown to the Rosenbergs
until the summer of 1997, after a grandchild of the couple who had
come to own it and had donated it to the museum read about it in
Feliciano's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extraordinary,'' Feliciano said of the museum's
decision. He said that it was one of the first cases of an American
museum's returning a Nazi-looted painting. He said the only other
case he could think of was the Detroit Institute of Art's return
return of a Monet to a Jewish family in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   When Rosenberg fled the Nazi invasion, he left behind numerous
paintings in a bank vault in Libourne, France.
</P>
<P>
   Ori Z. Soltes, chairman of the Holocaust Art Restitution
Project, said it now seemed likely that most major museums
possessed works of art with a tainted provenance. ``The most
flourishing point of the market during the war was New York,'' he
said. ``People turned a blind eye to what came through and how it
got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg's heirs made the claim to the painting in October
1997. The Seattle museum began researching the painting and
essentially asked the family to sue so that it could reach a
settlement that would include Knoedler &AMP; Co., the New York City art
dealer, which purchased the painting in Paris in 1954. Knoedler
sold the painting to Virginia and Prentice Bloedel, both now dead,
who donated it to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, the museum sued Knoedler. The suit, which is
still pending, claims that Knoedler committed fraud, negligent
misrepresentation and breach of warranty of title when it sold the
work to the Bloedels. The museum requested compensation for the
painting's market value, which may now exceed $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe they have a claim against us,'' said Lewis B.
Clayton of Paul, Weiss, Wharton &AMP; Garrison, the attorney for
Knoedler. ``The gallery did not act wrongfully in any way.'' He
said the gallery never dealt with the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Rosenberg, the widow of Paul Rosenberg's son, Alexandre,
said on Tuesday that the return of the painting meant that ``the
wind is blowing in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for my father-in-law, who was trying to retrieve
them one by one,'' Mrs. Rosenberg said of the lost paintings. ``His
children are finally coming home.''

THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS: ON FILM, THE WEB AND TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Linnell answered the door of his bandmate John
Flansburgh's work space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, on Sunday with
the slightly dazed grin of someone caught in the middle of the
creative process. The two Johns, who make up the bravely offbeat
pop duo They Might Be Giants, had been mixing songs in the room
they call the kitchen, not because they think it is a cool rock
name for a recording studio, but because that's where the stove was
when Flansburgh lived there.
</P>
<P>
   Over 18 years, the Giants have passed through many Brooklyn
apartments, from the Park Slope tenement with the hole in the
ceiling to the duplex over the Fort Greene barbecue joint where
they could play really loud. They have gone from releasing their
songs via Flansburgh's answering machine (they dubbed the call-in
service Dial-a-Song) to becoming stars of the college circuit with
seven albums and a touring band. Now each John has a separate
residence and rehearsal space, reflecting not only the needs of
married men but a prosperity that exceeds what most pop
nonconformists can expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love your air conditioner, Flans,'' said Linnell as he sat
between a xylophone and a bank of recording equipment. ``Mine just
blows hot air.''
</P>
<P>
   As the vintage contraption cooled the room, the conversation
drifted through various happy topics. There was the Los Angeles
premiere of ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' whose
brilliantly Bond-like opening theme, ``Dr. Evil,'' was composed by
the Giants and sung by Flansburgh's wife, Robin Goldwasser. Then
there were the five musical segments they created for ``Brave New
World,'' a science-and-technology series that will be broadcast on
ABC this summer. And their recent work with hit-making producers
and the former Ruffhouse Records co-owners Joe and Phil Nicolo, as
well as their appearance at Central Park Summerstage, headlining a
show that starts at 3 p.m. on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Flansburgh popped one tape after another into his stereo. ``This
is a theme we've done for a new Nickelodeon series, ``Stewy the
Dogboy,'' he said as human barking filled the room. He switched to
the exhilarating ``It's so Loud in Here,'' from the Nicolo
sessions. Next came ``She Thinks She's Edith Head,'' a witty
portrait of a woman with delusions of being ``an obscure cultural
figure,'' which appears on ``Long Tall Weekend,'' the Giants'
forthcoming album and the first to be available only on MP3, the
digital audio compression format.
</P>
<P>
   This sampler was impressive, but it overlooked some things, like
the duo's recent appearances on public radio's ``This American
Life.'' Not to mention the children's album they plan to release on
Rounder next year, the theme they composed for the new Fox
television sitcom pilot ``Malcolm in the Middle'' and the song on
Disney Home Video's forthcoming sequel to ``Peter Pan.'' Knee-deep
in movies, television and the Web, the Giants are riding a
multimedia wave.
</P>
<P>
   Especially exciting is the attention connected with the heavily
promoted ``Austin Powers.'' After the premiere, the Giants had 20
meetings with film and television representatives in two days. ``It
was interesting to see how many people involved in the creative
side of the film industry are genuine fans of what we do,''
Flansburgh said.
</P>
<P>
   They Might Be Giants is a classic cult band with an
unconventional approach to music and business. Fans spend hours
dissecting their lyrics and posting interpretations on the
Internet, discussing whether ``Ana Ng'' might be a critique of the
Vietnam War or whether ``S-E-X-X-Y'' has something to do with a sex
chromosome disorder. Aspiring individualists are attracted to the
Giants' blithely idiosyncratic sound, and they have helped the band
thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably have the highest-selling downloadable album of
all time,'' said Gene Hoffman, president and chief executive of
Emusic, formerly Goodnoise, the online company distributing ``Long
Tall Weekend.'' ``The Giants have never been afraid of trying new
things and they have an adventuresome fan base. That combination
makes it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the entertainment business brought by technologically
driven entrepreneurship are pushing the Giants beyond their
familiar realm in the margins. From another perspective, the
margins themselves are proving increasingly important, offering
antidotes to an overbearing mainstream of Backstreet Boys. New
outlets like MP3 and cable television are allowing discerning
consumers like Giants fans to choose their niches.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the cultural center is raiding the edges for
novelty at an ever increasing speed. And Generation X, a cohort
that grew up negotiating its supposed irrelevance, now fills those
entertainment industry cubicles in Hollywood and New York, not to
mention producing some of today's biggest stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can confirm that I've seen Mike Myers wearing a They Might
Be Giants T-shirt lounging around the house,'' said John Houlihan,
the music director for both Austin Powers films. Houlihan was one
of many show-business players to relay his devotion in phone
interviews. Joe Nicolo, the producer, called himself a devotee.
Hoffman said that the band's connection to Emusic was ``born of my
own appreciation; I'm a lifelong fan.'' So is Sarah Vowell, who
brought the musicians to ``This American Life'' through her feature
on Dial-a-Song.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel a shared sensibility with them, and not just because
of their songs,'' she said of the staff members of ``This American
Life,'' for which she is a contributing editor. ``It's because
every aspect of their project is done with purpose and humor and
love. Every album cover, every coffee mug, and the songs, too, are
all considered. They treat everything as art.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Flansburgh and Linnell, who grew up together in suburban Boston
and reconnected in Brooklyn after college, made their first demos,
powered by drum machines, in 1982. ``I couldn't sing and play the
guitar at the same time,'' Flansburgh recalled. ``We were not
calculating a career path.'' They were, however, steadfastly
developing their sound and sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``All through the 1980's and early 1990's we did two shows a
week and had this strangely rigorous routine where we would
rehearse for exactly one hour every single night,'' Flansburgh
said. ``It was like a homework assignment or going to the gym. We
got a lot of material together and had a really tight show.''
</P>
<P>
   Linnell added, ``It wasn't that we were technically that good.''
The two are now adept multi-instrumentalists. ``We were very
mediocre singers, but it didn't really matter. As far as the
audience was concerned it was a fun show.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s quirky bands ruled pop, empowered by punk's
anarchistic spirit and the trendy marriage of high art and rock
hi-jinks. The Giants felt free to pun with abandon and explore
endlessly arcane subjects in songs like ``Youth Culture Killed My
Dog.'' With their science-fair style, confidently nasal voices and
perverse talent for catchy melodies, they became the idols of young
brains and wallflowers.
</P>
<P>
   But pop soon grew out of this awkward phase, and most bands who
suited it changed or faded away. The Giants persisted, going from
the independent label Bar/None to a major, Elektra. They scored a
couple of modern-rock hits; one, ``Birdhouse in Your Soul,'' was
written from the perspective of a night light. The eight years the
Giants spent on Elektra were a fairly long run; they were not
surprised when the company cut them loose after a series of
corporate power shifts in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   By then the Giants had firmly established themselves as
innovative marketers as well as musicians. Their Dial-a-Song
gimmick added to their reputation as self-starters, as did the
Hello Music Club, a subscription service run by Flansburgh from
1993 to 1997 that released 10 CD singles a year by the Giants and
other bands. Promotional items like T-shirts and bumper stickers
featured either the work of renowned comic book artists or a
postwar Americana look that reflected the duo's fascination with
subjects like the 1964 World's Fair. Their videos further developed
a kitsch-savvy visual esthetic.
</P>
<P>
   Flansburgh stumbled into a second career when he directed a few
Giants videos. He now can list clips featuring Frank Black, Harvey
Danger, Edwyn Collins and others on his resume. Flansburgh also has
a side band, Mono Puff, which includes Ms. Goldwasser, and Linnell
is completing his first solo album, ``State Songs,'' to be released
on Rounder Records later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mono Puff and `State Songs' are things we get to do without
looking over each other's shoulder,'' Linnell said. ``They're what
we call `the Ringo walk,'' like the part of the movie ``Hard Day's
Night'' where Ringo Starr is walking around by himself, just
wrapped up in his own Ringo-ness. They also feed back into what
we're doing. We get to define They Might Be Giants better, and it
helps our songwriting.''
</P>
<P>
   A more conventional rock album is in the Giants' future,
possibly on a new label headed by Nicolo. ``We would like to make
this a creative statement and a financial statement,'' Nicolo said.
``We're not going to sacrifice quality, but it would be great for a
lot of people to rediscover them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to ``Dr. Evil,'' hordes of moviegoers already are. Like
so many of their lucky breaks, the Giants' ``Austin Powers'' theme
song came about because of their relentless productivity. Before
Houlihan had made a decision on whether the Giants should be
involved in the film, ``the band just took action and wrote a very
inspired song,'' he said. ``It was intended to be a demo, but when
we got it we just loved it and we put it in the very first frame of
the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Flansburgh and Linnell admit that they did ``Dr. Evil'' without
instruction. But they are delighted that it may lead to more
Hollywood assignments, especially because they are starting
families and would like to reduce their touring. There is one
catch, however. They have to be able to follow their recipe for
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who do commercial work are calculating about their
relationship to their audience,'' Flansburgh said. ``We've chosen
to assume that people listening to our songs are as smart as we
are, or smarter. I think that's why people like us.''

SENATE PASSES BILL TO LIMIT Y2K LAWSUITS LIABILITY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Aiming to limit lawsuits stemming from Year 2000
computer glitches, the Senate voted 62 to 37 Tuesday to give
businesses a chance to fix problems before customers can sue them.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation argued that it was needed to
protect the high tech industry against a potential litigation
avalanche arising from the Y2K glitch, referring to the possibility
that some computer micro-chips may read 2000 next Jan. 1 as 1900
and malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has threatened to veto the legislation because
administration officials say it doesn't offer enough protection to
consumers and small businesses. The Senate would need 67 votes to
override any veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope the president would not veto this bill,'' said
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., one of the bill's sponsors. ``It's
too important for California. You've got about one-third of the
high tech industry and 20 percent of the jobs concentrated in one
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 80 Y2K-related lawsuits have been filed to date, but
supporters of the bill say there may be many more after Jan. 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Mark Yarsike, a grocery-store owner in Warren,
Mich., sued when the $100,000 computer system that ran the store's
cash registers crashed because it couldn't handle a credit card
with an expiration date of 2000 or later.
</P>
<P>
   After unsuccessfully trying to get the system's manufacturer,
TEC America Inc., to fix it, Yarsike installed another one and took
TEC to court. He later settled his lawsuit for $260,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a supporter of the bill, said
``trillions of dollars'' worth of lawsuits could be filed, hurting
the high-tech industry and ultimately the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The measure calls for a 90-day ``cooling-off'' period that would
allow businesses to remedy any Y2K problems before a lawsuit is
filed.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day period begins when a business is notified by a
customer that they have a problem. The bill also would cap punitive
damages at $250,000 against businesses with 50 or fewer employees
or a net worth of $500,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
   The bill contains provisions that would make companies
responsible only for the portion of any Y2K-related damages they
caused. That limitation responds to concerns that large companies
like Microsoft or Intel could end up paying 100 percent of the
damages even if they were found to have caused only a portion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It eliminates the incentive to sue the deep pockets who may
not be a direct cause of the problem,'' said Sen. John McCain, the
bill's author.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, including Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., opposed
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill goes too far,'' Boxer said, explaining that it
covers people who shouldn't be given special protection. ``Why
should we protect a person who sells a computer or software in the
year 1999?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., another opponent, said it ``makes
sense to pass a moderate, thoughtful bill to protect the computer
industry,'' but that the bill was unfair to small businesses
because of the limits on damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some innocent man is put out of business he can only
recover the cost of his computer,'' said Edwards, a former trial
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators objected to any special treatment for the
computer industry because the potential problem has been known
about for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Y2K bug is not something that just fell out of the sky,''
said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. ``The Y2K problem is a result of
conscious choices that people did or didn't make...to fix a wiring
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   During debate on the Y2K legislation many supporters pointed to
a class-action lawsuit recently filed in California as an example
of the type of case the legislation is attempting to limit.
</P>
<P>
   In that case Circuit City, CompUSA, Office Max and Staples,
among others, are being sued for not warning consumers about
potential Y2K problems in computers and software they sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clear intent of this litigation is a large settlement,''
McCain said. ``It's not to remedy any injury or failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation will be reconciled with a similar House
bill that was passed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she will work with the administration to make the
measure more acceptable to the White House.

 &HT;    Online services 'the next step' in banking
 &HT;    (EDS: Replace 'a' in 'Net.Bank' with ampersand. Story not sent
to wires with ampersand to avoid garble.)By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few argue about whether the future of banking belongs
to the Internet: Web transactions are cheaper than paper ones, and
it costs a lot less to expand a bank's Web site than to build new
branches.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is who will dominate Web banking, the
traditional banks or the upstarts, like Alpharetta, Ga.'s Net.Bank?
And will the Internet-only banks share of online banking customers
ever be a significant amount compared to traditional banks?
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Runnfeldt, an analyst with First Security Van Kasper,
initiated coverage of Net.Bank with a ``sell'' rating last month.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Runnfeldt does not question the idea of banking
on the Web. He said he realizes online banking is taking off _ the
numbers of users is expected to triple to 25 million by 2001. He
also knows that major banks like Wells Fargo and BankAmerica are
continuing to develop Web sites, further validating the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But he questions whether the banks that operate mostly on the
Internet, such as Net.Bank, will have wide appeal despite their
high yields on deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Branchless banks such as Net.Bank have 1.3 percent of all online
banking customers, so far, according to the Online Banking Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view, the appeal of these new banks will remain
severely limited to a relatively small, niche group of highly
rate-sensitive customers who are willing to accept certain
inconveniences and do not have sophisticated loan and/or service
requirements,'' Runnfeldt said.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bank shares closed Tuesday at $29.37 1/2, up 9.8 percent.
Net.Bank is up 220 percent for 1999, but down 8.02 percent over the
last five trading sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Runnfeldt said banks are actively developing Web services.
Between 750 and 1,000 U.S. banks will offer Internet services by
the end of 1999, according to Online Banking Report. About 400
banks offer them now.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Runnfeldt does not see online banking being much
more than the next step in the evolution of telephone banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our view that most customers will look to the Internet
as just an additional delivery channel to complement the way they
currently access their bank's services, much like they already
treat ATMs and telephone banking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BancBoston Robertson Stephens thinks investors should buy shares
of Net.Bank. With last month's announcement that ETrade plans to
buy Telebanc, Net.Bank is the last branchless, pure Internet bank
that can grow.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Bryan Keane said Net.Bank has established itself as the
brand name in online banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When consumers think of online brokerage, they think of
ETrade, not Merrill Lynch,'' he said. ``If consumers want to buy a
book, they think Amazon.com, not Barnes and Noble. If I'm a
consumer, when I think of Internet banking will I think Wells Fargo
or Net.Bank? Net.Bank has the clear brand name creating a
competitive advantage over its competitors.''

 &HT;    Wired travellers reap benefits of online booking

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The best kind of travel is the last-minute kind,
booked online.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what the Atlanta founders of
LastMinuteTravel.com plan to convince travelers across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Their fledgling web site _ now in a ``sneak preview'' mode _
promises to link spur-of-the-moment travelers with airlines, hotels
and other suppliers that have unsold inventory to unload online.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive and founder David Miranda, a former Holiday Inn
Worldwide vice president, said the Internet has created a ``new jet
set.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The two week vacation is almost a thing of the past. Now, it's
'When can I get away,' `` he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to own the last-minute mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   Based in a small office, Miranda's start-up plans a national
marketing campaign this summer aimed at making LastMinuteTravel.com
the hottest new travel website.
</P>
<P>
   Getting consumers' attention will be key, as the Internet
already is a burgeoning bazaar of travel sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of sites is mushrooming and so is their importance
to consumers,'' said James Cammisa, publisher of Travel Industry
Indicators.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people use established, all-purpose giants like
Travelocity.com or PreviewTravel.com to check airfares and rates
for rental cars, hotel rooms, cruises and other products. They can
click into myriad specialty pages with bargains, and sign up for
e-mail alerts when sales arise.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, such as the heavily-advertised Priceline.com, have
a narrower focus or employ a twist. Priceline, for instance,
invites users to ``name their price'' for a flight and then tries
to meet it.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines, car rental companies and hotels also have their own
sites, many featuring weekly short-notice specials that also can be
e-mailed to potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, travel websites account for a small proportion of
bookings. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, for instance, says
Internet reservations still account for less than two percent of
its sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the genie is out of the bottle, experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a proliferation of sites and probably a
shakeout, but without question the consumer acceptance will keep
rising along with all forms of e-commerce,'' Cammisa said.
</P>
<P>
   LastMinuteTravel.com hopes to position itself as a ``stock
exchange'' for travel suppliers with unsold inventory and travelers
looking for last-minute seats, rooms or condos.
</P>
<P>
   The site promises offerings from a variety of suppliers,
including airlines, hotels, cruise lines and bed-and-breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   That comprehensiveness is why travelers will come to the site
rather than use others, Miranda said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone trying to go from Atlanta to, say, Washington, on short
notice could check last-minute fares from several airlines, not
just one. Without switching sites they also could check for hotel
rooms and a rental car.
</P>
<P>
   The site will also display event tickets and even tee times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if you're looking at airline tickets to San Francisco,
a window could pop up and tell you the Giants are playing the
Braves while you're in town and here's how to get tickets. Or
there's a concert or play and you can get tickets here,'' Miranda
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way those San Francisco businesses, unless they
are sitting in the baggage claim area, can get that information to
those potential consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although such offers often involve discounts,
LastMinuteTravel.com doesn't sell itself as a cheap travel site.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't see the words bargain or discount anywhere because
we don't know it will be,'' Miranda said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because LastMinuteTravel.com provides only an Internet
sales window; participating suppliers retain total control over how
much inventory is offered and at what price. They process bookings
through links to their own sites.
</P>
<P>
   Suppliers pay a fee to post their offerings on
LastMinuteTravel.com, which also gets revenue from advertising and
``data mining,'' or the sale of market statistics.
</P>
<P>
   So far, United, Continental and Midwest Express airlines have
agreed to list on the site, along with Hilton, Radisson, Westin
Sheraton and Swissotel hotels; Carnival, Norwegian and Renaissance
cruise lines; and Avis and Alamo car rentals.
</P>
<P>
   The site also will have an e-mail service, called TravelMinder,
to alert users to specific offers.
</P>
<P>
   With his hotel background, Miranda knew that unsold inventory is
the most perishable commodity in the travel industry. He's
convinced the Internet provides the ideal forum for selling it.
</P>
<P>
   As LastMinuteTravel marketing chief Jack Arogeti puts it, ``If
you've got vacant rooms today or tonight, you can't even market
that in a newspaper. How do you get to the potential customer?
Skywriting? Well, what you do is come to LastMinuteTravel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is not to maximize sales,'' said Miranda, ``it's to
minimize vacancies.''
</P>
<P>
   Miranda launched the company last winter, with financial and
technical backing from Atlanta-based iXL Enterprises Inc., a
minority owner. The company also took its idea to the Red Herring
venture capital show, where it was one of a handful invited to give
the one-minute ``elevator pitch,'' a sign of enthusiasm for the
business plan, Miranda said.
</P>
<P>
   He's confident LastMinuteTravel.com can carve out a niche in a
crowded market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is timing and a little luck. When I first had this
idea the critical mass wasn't there. Now the acceptance of
e-commerce has created that critical mass.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In Act II of ``Spinning Into Butter,'' the new play by
Rebecca Gilman at the Goodman Theater here, the protagonist
delivers a speech that has been stunning audiences into silence.
The character, a well-meaning college dean named Sarah Daniels, has
been unable to parse the tricky grammar of race relations in
academia. At last her frustration explodes into an anguished
monologue about her failure to accept black people, even after
years of immersion in the doctrine of inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fully aware that black people have agency and are
responsible and can help themselves,'' she tells an astonished
friend at one point in her 20-minute harangue. ``But I think they
don't do it because they're lazy and stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a speech full of lines like that, that make theatergoers
whisper, ``Did she just say what I think she said?'' But by the
time Sarah, almost exuberantly dismissing her self-editor,
confesses that she would rather remain standing than sit next to a
black man on the Chicago el, the audience is generally reduced to
squirmy silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having to deliver it is very unnerving,'' said Mary Beth
Fisher, who plays Sarah. ``The first preview I was dripping sweat.
I've gotten mostly over it, but I'd be lying if I said my blood
pressure doesn't go up just a little bit as I approach the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing is that Sarah, whose sins are far more of thought than
deed and whose self-scrutiny is clearly to be seen as a virtue, is
the most sympathetic character in the play, which is about _ well,
not to mince words _ white guilt. And it has been evident, from the
atmosphere in the theater and the comments in the post-performance
discussions the Goodman is holding nightly, that many in the
audience recognize themselves. That's not entirely surprising; the
Goodman audience is overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here because I was looking for answers, and now I find
all I have is more questions,'' one woman moaned on a recent
evening, sounding very much like Sarah herself. And also perhaps
not surprisingly, several black theatergoers had a different
reaction; they did not share in the discomfort or the shock at
Sarah's revelations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised by that soliloquy,'' said Stephanie
Williams, 34, a writer for The Chicago Reporter, a local monthly
that focuses on racial issues. ``And I don't think most of my peers
would be. We know what white people think.'' She added: ``It is
intended, I think, to make white people feel OK about some of their
suppressed feelings, so they don't feel guilty about admitting
them. You can't be afraid to ask yourself those questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams and others made the point that when Sarah explodes,
well, it's about time someone did; catharsis is a necessary step.
``The thing I greatly appreciated, more than anything, was that a
white person verbally acknowledged that they do consciously behave
differently around African-Americans,'' said Carley Smelser, 38, a
former phone company engineer who is about to start law school.
``I've been on the bus. I see them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah judges herself a racist, and though many of the black
audience members interviewed would not let her off the hook, they
forgave her for it. ``She's still trying to purge herself of racist
viewpoints,'' said Marti Worell, 45, a risk-management executive,
who is black. ``But it's her reactive nature, not her reasoning
nature, that she's dealing with. The only way you can kill a demon
is face it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gilman, who is white, acknowledged that ``quite a bit'' of
Sarah's speech drew on her own experience. She said there were
moments when she considered pulling her punches, softening Sarah's
mea culpa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think yes, she is a racist, but if there's a good kind of
racist to be, that's what she is,'' she said. ``I took it to an
extreme on purpose for dramatic reasons, but I chose to keep going
because I trusted I wasn't alone, that I wouldn't come off as some
freak. I knew I wanted to write a character who was a thoughtful,
educated and articulate racist. You never get to see that. The
racists you see on screen or in plays are almost always
dismissible.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``Spinning Into Butter'' concerns what happens when
a troubled teen-ager named Simon Brick, one of a handful of black
freshman at a small, mostly white college in Vermont, starts
receiving hostile notes. This turns the subject of discussion among
the onstage characters, mostly college faculty members, to racism
in their midst, who is at fault and what they ought to do about it.
The twist, from the dramatic perspective, is that none of those
characters are black. One secondary character is Hispanic (or
Nuyorican, as he prefers to call himself), but the only black
presence in the play is Simon, who never appears onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Whites talking about blacks; it is, in conception, a thumb in
the eye to the contemporary instinct toward inclusion (read:
political correctness). It is provocative enough that its run has
already been extended three times, through June 27. Reviews have
been largely enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Every person interviewed for this article responded positively
to the play's stimulus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really caught off guard by it, and I loved it that it
made me feel hopeful that we can get past the issue of how we hide
racism from ourselves,'' said Ms. Worell. ``You know, sometimes we
like to feel as black people we're not racist. And we are.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The playwright, a woman of placid demeanor who is quietly
forthright in conversation, defies the expectation of a
provocateur. She is a native of Trussville, Ala., a small town
outside Birmingham known for producing fire extinguishers. She
still speaks with a bit of a drawl that is particularly noticeable
here in Chicago, where she has been living since 1994, after
finishing a graduate degree in theater at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The central event of ``Spinning Into Butter,'' the anonymous
persecution of Simon Brick, derives from a similar episode at
Middlebury College in Vermont in the early 1980s, when Ms. Gilman
was briefly a student there.
</P>
<P>
   Her career is gathering momentum. After, by her estimate, some
150 rejections of her plays by nonprofit theaters all over the
country, Circle Theater, a tiny company outside Chicago, took a
chance on her grim look at two youthful serial killers, ``The Glory
of Living.'' The sterling reviews drew the attention of, among
others, the Royal Court Theater in London, whose production opened
in January to critical praise.
</P>
<P>
   That also resulted in a commission from the Goodman for its
smaller stage, the 135-seat Studio Theater, which turned into
``Spinning Into Butter.'' The Goodman subsequently commissioned a
second play, and she wrote ``Boy Meets Girl,'' about a young woman
who is stalked by a man with whom she has one date; it is scheduled
for the Goodman's main stage next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of `Spinning' and `Boy' as two sides of the same
coin,'' Ms. Gilman said. ``One is about what it is to objectify
people, and the other is about what it is to be objectified. I
guess the theme of objectification runs throughout my work.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``objectification isn't all bad,'' she said. ``It's how
we forge our identities, separate ourselves from other people. You
say, `There's a handsome guy!' That's objectification. It's how you
find out who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every night the first question asked at the post-play
discussion is why Simon never appears. Ms. Gilman's explanation was
twofold. One was the strategy of a dramatist: the play is about how
others view Simon, she said, not about Simon himself, and to show
him onstage would undermine that.
</P>
<P>
   But the other reason is the strategy of a white woman; she felt
uneasy, she said, putting words in the mouth of a black man. She
did, however, put words in the mouth of a Hispanic character, a
student whose prickly racial pride spurs Sarah to her excruciating
self-examination. Ms. Gilman said she could not explain the
inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the Goodman invited several classes of students from
Chicago public schools to a special matinee. Among other things, it
brought the play its first largely black audience. The teen-agers,
a generally restless bunch, absorbed Sarah's second-act speech in
ever enveloping silence, listening as she described, and decried
her experience of taking a job at an all-black school in Chicago.
(The following transcription omits a few expletives.)
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still thought I could do a good job,'' Sarah says. ``And
then I met the students. And they were all black. Of course. And
some of them were great, and some of them were OK, and some of them
were pains, and some of them were awful. Which is how the world is,
except that the ones who were awful seemed, really, exceptionally
awful. They were loud and belligerent, and they walked down the
hall in packs, and they were so loud. . . . They were so rude and
loud and stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an extraordinary moment, or so it seemed: a real group of
people being objectified by a fictional character on the stage. The
silence persisted. The play came to an end. In the discussion that
followed, the moderator, a white man, asked, How many of you think
Sarah is a racist? Not a single student raised a hand. Not one.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the least racist of all of them,'' one student said, at
last. ``Because she's talking about it.''

 &HT;    Teenagers under arrest for lemonade stand heist
 &HT;    By Rachel Kipp
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Police have arrested two Butler County teen-agers
based on a description of their getaway truck provided by a
9-year-old boy, who says the pair robbed his lemonade stand of
nearly $10 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Aaron Faughn, said Monday that he just wants them to
apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I think it's wrong what they did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police, however, charged the juveniles with delinquency by
reason of complicity to theft. They are accused of being present
when the robbery occurred, said Toni Pagano, administrative
coordinator for the Butler County Juvenile Courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now (the suspects) are blaming each other,'' Pagano
said. ``(Who actually committed the robbery) is being left up to
the court to decide after receiving all of the evidence and
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said they located the teen-agers with information
provided by Aaron and neighbors in the Lakota Pointe Town Homes
development in southern Butler County.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron was running his lemonade stand Thursday afternoon when two
males driving a red and gray Blazer asked him for change for $10.
When he attempted to give them the change, the pair took all of his
money.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Faughn, Aaron's mother, said her son didn't know either
of the robbers and that she would like an apology for her son.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Debbie Brannigan said the sheriff's deputy who
identified the vehicle based on Aaron's description is an officer
who works in Liberty Twp. and recognized the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Pagano said one of the teen-agers is in the Butler County
Juvenile Detention Center and one was released to his parents. A
court date has been scheduled for June 22 at the Butler County
Juvenile Court.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's office offered a cash reward for information
leading to an arrest and conviction of lemonade stand robbery.
Deputies received more than 30 tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has been very generous in terms of offering
information. Other people have called wanting to know if they could
do something for the boy,'' said Brad Kraemer, a sheriff's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron went out and set up his lemonade stand the day after the
robbery under the supervision of his mother, her boyfriend, and his
14-year-old sister, who helped fill out the police report the day
before. The police also drove by during the day. Debbie Faughn said
she thinks her son feels safe enough to continue his neighborhood
business. set up the stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Aaron) knows this was an isolated incident and that
these kind of things don't happen everyday,'' she said.

 &HT;    Entertainment execs share controversial opinions at convention
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Angry with their critics, two leading entertainment
moguls fumed Tuesday that they can't tell how violent is too
violent when it comes to television programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to be ashamed of,'' said Viacom Chairman Sumner
Redstone, whose company owns the Paramount TV and movie studios.
``I'm outraged by the media criticism of us. We run the same movies
in Europe as we do here and people in Europe don't go out and kill
one another.''
</P>
<P>
   His heated comments came as part of a panel at the annual
convention of the National Cable Television Association, which runs
here through Wednesday. The other panelists included Time Warner
Chief Executive Officer Gerald Levin, billionaire media investor
Paul Allen and Comcast President Brian Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, who heads the world's largest entertainment company, said
his company tried to act responsibly, but he added, it is often
hard to determine the difference between art and offensive
material.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unrealistic to think that we can determine what's obscene
and what's artistic. That's up to the viewer. I mean, is 'Saving
Private Ryan' obscene in its level of graphic violence?
</P>
<P>
   ``And let's distinguish between sex and violence,'' continued
the 73-year-old Redstone. ``Sex is good. Violence is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Redstone's comments earned a big laugh from the audience of
several thousand cable executives, but the issue is no laughing
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Since the student massacre at Littleton, Colo., the
entertainment industry has been under heavy attack by several
prominent Congressmen and other critics. They decry the high number
of violent and sexually explicit shows.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's panel, however, the entertainment executives tried
to turn the tables on those who would censor their violent or
sexually explicit programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obscene what the political system is doing with media
criticism of violent programming,'' said Levin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are drawing attention away from the real issues of
gun control and drug awareness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who heads one of the country's largest cable operators,
said he too was uncomfortable with censuring shows. ``It's tough as
an operator to say block this show or that channel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided early on to leave those decisions to families and
support the technology that would let them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That technology, which is now widely available, includes the
V-Chip and software such as SurfWatch.

</P>
<P>
   SURREALISM-GUGGENHEIM (New York) _ Surrealism, generally thought
of as melting watches and men in bowler hats descending from the
sky, began as a literary movement. The movement in its heyday
always had a literary bent _ a wide angle, in fact, to judge by the
large number of remarkable book illustrations and covers on view in
``Surrealism: Two Private Eyes,'' an exhibition at the Guggenheim
Museum running through Sept. 12. By Vicki Goldberg.

ascendance in 2002 to music director of the Cleveland Orchestra is
hopeful news. Conductors and orchestras are sometimes about
individual and collective personalities, but in some places,
Cleveland among them, the subject is chemistry. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-DISKS (Undated) _ For 20 years home video has thrived on a
simple process: choose a movie, watch it, engage in some thought
and discussion, move on. Now, though, operating on the principle
that nothing gets simpler, along comes the digital video disk (DVD)
to immerse one in films to a degree that will intrigue some and
repel others. DVD invites the average viewer to become a film buff,
defined as one who wants to know all about how the movie was made
and by whom. By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   CHOPIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Music history has its myths and its
debunkers of myths. Beethoven wasn't quite the political idealist
he seems in the story about tearing up the ``Eroica'' dedication
when Napoleon crowned himself Emperor; Schubert wasn't a cheerful
bohemian who died unknown. In the case of Chopin, it is so obvious
that his melodies and arabesques sound like the `bel canto'' opera
of his day that the conventional wisdom has him ``influenced'' by
opera. By Will Crutchfield.

 &HT;    CAU receives $1 million grant
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Clark Atlanta University has received a $1 million
grant from the Lilly Endowment/United Negro College Fund to enhance
its computer technology program and develop a distance-learning
center.
</P>
<P>
   The historically black college was one of several that received
part of a $41.7 million grant, the largest single grant in the
61-year history of the endowment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improved technology gives the university the opportunity to
improve its services and academic programs,'' said Clark Atlanta
President Thomas Cole Jr., also chairman of the UNCF Council of
Presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The money will enable the school to make improvements to its
interactive computer labs and extend the reach of the school's
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   The Lilly endowment also will enable the school to set up a
Distance Learning Center that will teach faculty and staff about
various multimedia technology _ the Web, videotape and interactive
videoconferencing _ used in distance learning.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, schools are using distance learning to extend
programs outside their geographic area.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the grant will help the school complete its
installation of BANNER, an integrated computer system that will
replace the three software systems now used at the university.
</P>
<P>
   The project is expected to be completed by spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, separate computer systems serve finance and payroll,
student accounts and registration, and alumni functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to take a student's application from
acceptance to registration and enrollment, maintain grades and
financial information through graduation and beyond,'' said Winfred
Harris, provost and vice president of academic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a student's information is put into the BANNER database,
it will remain for a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilly Endowment is an Indianapolis-based, private philanthropic
foundation created in 1937.

 &HT;    Georgia-based tech stocks slumping, with few exceptions
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Technology stocks in general have taken a beating
recently, but the worm might have softened the blow for ISS Group,
an Atlanta company that makes software that protects computer
networks.
</P>
<P>
   News of the latest computer virus, the Worm.Explore.Zip, raised
awareness of the vulnerability of computers and computer networks,
which might have had some residual benefit on the stock of
companies that protect against viruses, said David Breiner, an
analyst with Volpe Brown Whelan.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of ISS Group are up 1.4 percent over the last five
trading sessions, a modest increase, but significantly higher than
other local technology stocks. ISS is down 39 percent from its
52-week high March 18, but up 2.3 percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Powers, who covers ISS Group for BancBoston Robertson
Stephens, upgraded ISS Group this month to a ``buy.'' Powers said
ISS' business is going well, and, at about half the price of its
52-week high, its shares are a relative bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is great there, both in success in marketing and
selling and in having interesting products,'' he said. ``They
consistently lead their market sector.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock of some of Georgia's more well-known technology
companies have been slumping along with the rest of the nation's
publicly traded technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Alpharetta, Ga.'s Net.Bank is down 11.5 percent the last five
days. Net.Bank shares have dropped 66 percent since hitting a
52-week high of $83 April 14. But Net.Bank is still up 208.2
percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Security First Technologies, a maker of software that lets banks
put their banking services on the Internet, is down 22.5 percent
over the last five trading sessions. Security First is down 61.5
percent from its 52-week high April 14. Overall, Security First
shares have doubled in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of MindSpring Enterprises, the Atlanta Internet Service
Provider, are down 16.2 percent the last five days. MindSpring's
stock price has dropped 54.7 percent from a 52-week high April 13
and is down 1.3 percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree, the leader of the electronic bill paying and bill
presenting market, has seen its shares drop 1.1 percent the last
five days. For 1999, CheckFree is up 51.2 percent.

 &HT;    Fifty big-screen actors and actresses named Tuesday to the
American Film Institute's newest list
 &HT;    EDs: List is embargoed for newspapers until Wednesday. For
internet use: List cannot be posted until 11 p.m. Tuesday June 15.
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You must remember them: Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Fred
Astaire, Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn and Greta Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   They are just six of the 50 big-screen actors and actresses
named Tuesday to the American Film Institute's newest list: the
greatest American screen legends.
</P>
<P>
   Bogart topped the list of 25 male screen legends while four-time
Oscar winner Hepburn led the 25 actresses.
</P>
<P>
   Who else made the grade? Most of the usual suspects: Cary Grant,
James Stewart, Bette Davis, Audrey Hepburn, Shirley Temple and John
Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Poitier was the only African-American chosen.
</P>
<P>
   The star lists, announced Tuesday night during a three-hour AFI
special on CBS, follow last year's selections by the film
organization of the 100 greatest American films. That list touted
such classics as ``Citizen Kane,'' ``Casablanca'' and ``Gone With
The Wind'' as well as more modern-day hits ``Star Wars'' and
``Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   AFI expects its star lists ``to ignite passions, spark debate
and invite criticism, all of which we welcome as a means of
engaging the nation in a discussion of American movie history and
bringing movie fans back to the classics,'' said Jean Picker
Firstenberg, AFI director and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Left off the star rosters were such big names as Richard Burton,
Charlton Heston, Rock Hudson, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Olivia de
Havilland, Helen Hayes and Susan Hayward.
</P>
<P>
   AFI's rules eliminated many current big-name stars such as
three-time Oscar winner Jack Nicholson, two-time winner Meryl
Streep, Paul Newman, Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Clint Eastwood,
Tom Hanks and Jodie Foster.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the AFI defined an American screen legend as ``an
actor or team of actors with significant screen presence in
American feature-length films whose screen debut occurred in or
before 1950, or whose screen debut occurred after 1950 but whose
death has marked a completed body of work.''
</P>
<P>
   An AFI panel offered up 500 stars as list nominees and the
finalists were chosen in ballots sent to roughly 1,800 industry
celebrities, technicians, historians, critics and other cultural
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen stars chosen for the two lists were born outside the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Four of those selected _ Henry Fonda, Ginger Rogers, Rita
Hayworth and Edward G. Robinson _ were once in the same movie:
1942's ``Tales of Manhattan.'' Buster Keaton, also named to the
male legend list, was an uncredited writer on the film.

Hannibal 
Thomas Harris (Delacorte, $27.95) 
 
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've been waiting for him to resurface for more than 10 years.
Now, he's back, and he is, for a while at least, everything you
want him to be.
</P>
<P>
   Serial killer Hannibal Lecter makes his entrance on Page 30 of
Thomas Harris' new novel, ``Hannibal'' (Delacorte, $27.95), after a
rather contrived first chapter in which FBI agent Clarice Starling
gets caught in a botched drug raid and kills five people to the
sound of ``La Macarena''on a boom box.
</P>
<P>
   Television cameras record the debacle and send Clarice's career
into a nose dive. Seven years after he made his grisly escape from
authorities, the brilliant and ever-informed Lecter writes from his
hiding place in Italy to taunt and, in his own withering way,
encourage Clarice during her professional humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   As she reads his letter, she hears Lecter's voice in her head,
just as we hear the voice of Anthony Hopkins _ a measure of how
indistinguishable the novel/film phenomenon of ``The Silence of the
Lambs'' has become. But does this new book measure up to Harris'
1988 blockbuster?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no. And yet ``Hannibal'' is still a tantalizing
mix of the ridiculous and the sublime.
</P>
<P>
   The book is deeply gruesome, a whole new level of gore even for
Harris. Although ``Lambs'' was efficiently told, with no
distracting literary tactics to stall its story, the writing in``
Hannibal'' is slowed by changes in tense and in the flow of its
narrative voice. And what happens to Lecter and Clarice at the end
of the novel is amazing _ but surely not in the way the author
intended it to be. It does not take your breath away so much as it
leaves you staring incredulously at the page. I will not give it
away, and I'm not sure you would believe me if I did.
</P>
<P>
   But we are dealing with Thomas Harris here, and he is so far
above other writers in his genre that you can quibble with entire
endings and still admit you couldn't put the book down.
</P>
<P>
   Like his villains, he displays flashes of intelligence and humor
that are exhilarating. He is not predictable. He is not amateurish.
And whether you like the ending or not, he always gives you your
money's worth in suspense and blood-flinging entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   His specialty, of course, is his villains, the weirdos he makes
mesmerizing by endowing them with brilliance or superb taste or a
remorseless predilection for flamboyant violence. In Hannibal
Lecter, he has managed to combine cannibalism and charm so
seamlessly that we actually find ourselves a bit baffled by
Lecter's fascination with Clarice Starling. She is young,
attractive, courageous and capable. He eats his enemy's brains for
breakfast, and we wonder what he sees in her.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hannibal,'' there are two main villains: Lecter himself and
one of his previous victims, a millionaire named Mason Verger.
Verger has survived a nasty encounter with Lecter, although he did
not survive it well. In an incident involving two starving dogs, a
mirror and a mere suggestion from Lecter (the same easy influence
he exerted over Miggs, the asylum inmate who threw semen at
Starling in ``''``Silence of the Lambs ''and later committed
suicide by swallowing his tongue), Verger has relieved himself of
his face _ he has no lips, nose or eyelids, is paralyzed (Lecter
broke his neck for good measure) and breathes through a respirator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mason Verger, noseless and lipless, with no soft tissue on his
face, was all teeth, like a creature of the deep, deep ocean,''
Harris writes. ``Inured as we are to masks, the shock in seeing him
is delayed. Shock comes with the recognition that this is a human
face with a mind behind it. It churns you with its movement, the
articulation of the jaw, the turning of the eye to see you. To see
your normal face.''
</P>
<P>
   Verger lives in a wing of his family mansion, where he keeps a
huge eel in an aquarium by his bed and inflicts sadistic mental
torture on poor children he has brought in from the slums (before
he was rendered immobile, he liked to rape his sister and molest
boys at a Christian camp). But Verger's main interest is plotting
his revenge against Lecter.
</P>
<P>
   After much thought, he has chosen a method: He will capture
Lecter and feed him alive to pigs that eat human flesh. And, yes,
in Thomas Harris' world, there are people who raise animals for
that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   What ensues is your basic cat-and-mouse game. There is a side
trip to Italy, where Lecter has been living as Dr. Fell, the
scholarly curator of the Palazzo Capponi, a man of great education,
breeding and taste. Things go sour there when a hapless Italian
detective named Pazzi suspects Dr. Fell's true identity and
contacts Mason Verger about the huge reward he has offered for
Lecter's capture alive.
</P>
<P>
   We know the detective is not long for this world, but he
provides many opportunities to show off Harris' eye for detail
(spying on Lecter's apartment, Pazzi ``backed into the shadow
across the street, his nose the last to disappear''). Lecter
disembowels him and hangs him from a Tuscan wall, then endures a
laughable flight back to the United States as part of a package
tour, during which he contemplates airline food and the prattle of
children.
</P>
<P>
   It's when he gets home that Harris' intentions go awry. In
Italy, Lecter was still the magnificent villain of ``Lambs,'' evil
incarnate contained in an impeccable package. But when he returns
to America for a showdown with Verger and his long-awaited reunion
with Starling, Lecter turns into something altogether different.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Harris endows him with a past. There were a mother and
father, killed by the Nazis when Hannibal was 6. There was a
sister, Mischa, whose subsequent death at the hands of deserters
provides some insight into Lecter's taste for human flesh.
</P>
<P>
   And there is, of course, Clarice Starling. At the end of``
Hannibal,'' her association with Lecter travels in new directions.
Without giving too much away, I'll just say that it is a rather
wacky way to go with these characters, one that contradicts so much
of what we know about them from ``Lambs'' and Harris' previous
book, ``Red Dragon.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a move could be fatal to a lesser novel. But ``Hannibal''
survives its flaws. It is gory and self-conscious and frequently
over the top. Its writing is occasionally clumsy and its ending is
bizarre. And I'll tell you this: I couldn't put it down. &QL;

FETISHIST? BEATLEMANIAC? JUST CALL ME A COLLECTOR.

<P>
   I did not attend Sir George Martin's recent lecture on the
making of ``Sgt. Pepper,'' but not because I don't find the details
of the Beatles' recordings thoroughly fascinating. Quite the
contrary. But I had heard and read Sir George's account several
times, and reports from earlier stops on his tour indicated that
his talk, entertaining though it was, covered no new ground.
Mainly, I was confident that the excerpts he played from the
session tapes were already safely in my collection.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I admit it: if I weren't reviewing another concert, I might
have gone on the prospect that Sir George's playlist included a
snippet that had eluded me. Is $50 too much for that? Not for those
of us who happily commit time and money to the search for, say, the
Australian 45 rpm reissue of ``I Want to Hold Your Hand,'' for its
stereo mix with centered vocals (the British and American mixes put
the vocals to one side), or the latest rarity, a British mono
pressing of ``Revolver'' with the matrix number XEX 606-1 printed
into the runout groove of side two. That disk includes an otherwise
unavailable mix of ``Tomorrow Never Knows,'' which was replaced
with the common version only a few hours into the press run.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a steep tariff for those of us who regularly buy
bootleg disks for the sake of a few new minutes of previously
unheard session tape. Is this fetishism? Fetishism, I guess, is in
the eye of the beholder: if I collect something you regard as
manifestly trivial, you will write me off as a fetishist; if you
see the point of my collection, you'll regard it as high
appreciation, perhaps even scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Your view, moreover, will be colored by whether you collect
anything yourself. There is a respect among collectors akin to the
honor among thieves. We recognize kindred spirits in those who seek
not only to amass a particular thing _ whatever it may be _ but to
know the history of each item in minute detail.
</P>
<P>
   I am not a serious jazz collector, but when I listen to Phil
Schaap's radio show on WKCR-FM and hear him introduce a four-minute
disk with a 15-minute rundown of session dates and locations, the
producer, soloists, sidemen, take and matrix numbers and the
history of the recording's permutations on disk, I know that this
is my kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, respectability has come late to Beatles collecting. Early
on, it seemed just another example of the adulation of rock
musicians and movie stars, something that those of a serious bent
have always regarded with a combination of amusement and disdain.
Even so, someone who collected Beatles gum cards, wigs, dolls, ice
cream wrappers and fan magazines in the 1960s would not have been
called a fetishist: in those days, pop culture was less
self-consciously analyzed, and the language was less fraught with
pop psychologizing. Beatlemania was a ``fad,'' a ``craze,'' terms
that carried the sense that such ephemera was not worthy of
chin-stroking analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, someone who kept such a collection intact and in good
shape is now sitting on a small fortune, and if the people who now
shell out for those items can be called fetishists, they can point
out, soberingly, that a picture sleeve for ``Can't Buy Me Love''
that cost 59 cents (with the record) in 1964 can now fetch $450
(without the record); that a set of the smiling, instrument-bearing
Remco Beatle dolls that sold for a couple of dollars apiece now
command $500 and that a near-mint stereo copy of the 1966 album
``Yesterday and Today,'' with its original cover, which was
withdrawn _ the Beatles in butcher smocks, draped with raw meat and
broken baby dolls _ is listed in collectors guides for as much as
$20,000, a spectacular return on the original $2.99.
</P>
<P>
   In the Beatles-collecting circles I travel in, though,
investment isn't the point. Nor is adulation, for that matter, and
the amassing of 1960s trinkets, though fun in a kitschy way, is
incidental. It's about the music. The fact is, nearly 30 years
after they broke up, the Beatles' music endures for its musical
strength, not its nostalgia value. That the group's music evolved
from simplicity to sophistication with such rapidity is itself a
matter of fascination: in musical terms, the distance from ``I Want
to Hold Your Hand'' to ``Strawberry Fields Forever'' is vast. The
Beatles traversed it in three years. How they did it is a
legitimate subject of musical inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   If you visit the Beethoven Geburtshaus, in Bonn, you can peer
into glass display cases at ear trumpets, eyeglasses and personal
effects preserved with fetishistic care. You can also examine
manuscript pages full of ink blots and crossed-out sections. In
these, and in Beethoven's sketchbooks, one can follow surprisingly
mundane themes as they are reworked and transformed into the
``Eroica'' and other titanic works.
</P>
<P>
   For the Beatles, alternative mixes and unreleased recordings _
concerts, BBC radio performances and raw session tape, traded
clandestinely or sold on bootlegs _ are the sketches that fill out
their creative history. Granted, some mixing oddities are
interesting merely because they have an extra ``woo'' before the
fadeout (the stereo ``Slow Down'' . . . never mind). Mostly,
though, the attraction of these recordings is that they let us in
on the choices that went into creating some of the greatest pop
recordings ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Those choices are most dramatic in the later sessions. The group
was coining money for its label, EMI, and therefore had unlimited
studio time, so John Lennon and Paul McCartney often brought in
works-in-progress, which they fleshed out during the sessions. But
even the early sessions illuminate the compositional process.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The entire March 5, 1963, session at which they recorded their
third single, ``From Me to You,'' is available on bootlegs. The
song had been written only days before the session, and in the
first few takes, there is no provision for an instrumental break.
With take 5, they added the bit where they play two lines of the
verse melody, singing ``from me'' and ``to you'' as vocal
punctuation _ an addition they are heard discussing before they
begin playing. With take 7 they had the basic track, upon which
they overdubbed vocal embellishments (the ``da-da-da, da-da dum-dum
da'' introduction) and a harmonica (on both the newly devised
instrumental break and the ending) to create take 8.
</P>
<P>
   The tape also includes ``edit pieces,'' fragments that could be
spliced onto the body of the song if they proved sufficiently
interesting. Mainly, these were alternative versions of the
introduction. One has them humming instead of singing. Another has
a harmonica but no vocals. In a third, they double the ``da-da-da''
vocals of take 8 in falsetto, an octave higher. All those notions
were rejected _ sort of. Actually, the stereo mix is take 8,
unadorned, but the mono mix has both the ``da-da-da'' vocal and the
harmonica _ a permutation that is neither heard on the session tape
nor mentioned in the logs in which the session is documented. Even
with the materials at hand, the mysteries never end.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, bootleggers have been muddying the historical waters by
using such components to make new alternative versions. In this
they are taking a cue from the ``Anthology'' sets, in which several
outtakes were combined to create a new version in a triumph of
cosmetics over historicity.
</P>
<P>
   These concoctions, which collectors call ``outfakes,'' support
the notion that the ``Sgt. Pepper'' we know is only one possible
``Sgt. Pepper.'' A collector, though, would put it differently: the
``Sgt. Pepper'' we hear on CD is one of the  &UR; two &LR;  ``Sgt. Pepper''
albums the Beatles released in 1967. The mono mix, long out of
print, was different in some details. In ``Lucy in the Sky With
Diamonds,'' an electronic phasing effect gives Lennon's voice a
spacey, psychedelic quality lost in stereo. ``She's Leaving Home''
runs faster and at a higher pitch in mono, and sounds immensely
better for it. And the reprise of the title song has an extra bar
of drum introduction in mono.
</P>
<P>
   I once pointed out these differences to Sir George, whose first
reaction was slightly testy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to do an awful lot of changing our minds at the last
moment, and doing different things, mainly because we didn't think
it was that important to be consistent,'' he said. ``I don't think
it's all that significant. But I can see that it does cause a
certain amount of consternation from people who devote their lives
to analyzing the differences.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a matter of consternation, I told him, just the kind
of details that make collecting interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand that,'' Sir George said. ``It's rather like
finding a rare coin, and finding that the milled edge is missing a
point _ that kind of thing?''
</P>
<P>
   A milled edge, a missing point? The telltale jargon of a
collector! No wonder Sir George's tone changed so quickly.

 &HT;    FLEEING SERBIAN VILLAGERS TELL OF ETHNIC CLEANSING IN REVERSE
 &HT;    EDS: Optional trim at 800
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STARI KACANIK, Yugoslavia _ Scores of terrified Serbian
civilians fled this village Tuesday, 24 hours after armed Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas returned from the hills and discovered a
mass grave that they blamed on Serbian troops and the local ethnic
Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA fired many shots in the air. They told us, 'We don't
want to see any of you left in this village in the morning,''' said
Sasha Janicivich, 30, an ethnic Serb from this verdant farm village
20 miles south of the Kosovo capital Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Another frightened Kosovar Serb from the village, Goran Simic,
42, said, ``The KLA came to my neighbor's house and said, 'It's not
safe for you to stay here.' We decided to leave because it was
better to save our own skins.''
</P>
<P>
   Janicivich and Simic maintained they were not members of any
Serbian paramilitary group, just peace-loving Serbian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like brothers with the Albanians,'' said Simic, one of
about 150 Serbians from Stari Kacanik who were joining uncounted
thousands of Serbian civilians driving north out of Kosovo in cars
crammed with family members and random possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Janicivich and Simic were among six Serbians from different
families in Stari Kacanik who told a brutal tale Tuesday of reverse
ethnic cleansing at the hands of the triumphant KLA. They were
interviewed along a roadside as they headed to Serbia in a
slow-moving caravan of 30 automobiles and horse-drawn carts.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, a correspondent reached the village. The KLA
soldier manning the first KLA checkpoint led the way down a grassy
hillside. There in a corner of a field was what appeared to be a
recently dug mass grave site, so fresh that the grass had not begun
to grow on the dirt covering the 17 mounds in the shape of corpses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many bodies here,'' said the KLA soldier,
23-year-old Sadiq Alieu. ``This town was a place the Serbian Army
had a headquarters. But we don't exactly know who did this
massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   A crew from CNN had driven into the village minutes earlier, and
a CNN cameraman was videotaping the gravesite.
</P>
<P>
   Shkurte Deda, a 16-year-old ethnic Albanian, showed up to watch.
She described how she had watched about a month and a half ago from
her house just across the road as the mass burial took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soldiers came here about 9 o'clock one evening with a
tractor full of bodies,'' she said. The next morning about 10 a.m.,
she said she saw Yugoslav troops digging holes for the bodies with
what she described as a ``big machine.'' From the way she gestured
with her hands, the machine could have been a backhoe.
</P>
<P>
   The Stari Kacanik suspected burial site is located roughly ten
miles from another mass grave that was discovered in a town called
Kacanik (cq) by British peacekeepers several days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Stari Kacanik is being played out, in varying
degrees, throughout Kosovo as KLA rebels emerge triumphantly from
forests and mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In Prizren Tuesday, a high-ranking rebel official sauntered into
a cafe and declared that Kosovo's second largest city was the first
one under complete KLA control.
</P>
<P>
   Mobbed by photographers and residents, the KLA's Rexha(cq) Ekram
sipped coffee as the cafe owner placed a bouquet on the table next
to his Kalashnikov rifle. A few days ago, Serb troops would have
killed him if he showed up here, but Tuesday he bantered with
reporters in good English and made an impromptu announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``From today, the city is in KLA hands 100 percent,'' said
Ekram, known around Prizren by his war name, Commander Drini.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA, a force of an estimated 15,000 troops, seeks
independence from Yugoslavia for Kosovo and its majority ethnic
Albanian population. The army and its provisional government became
a defacto ally of NATO during its 78 days of air strikes against
Yugoslavia. It helped supply targeting information and, eventually,
may have helped bring Serbian troops into the open where NATO bombs
could kill them.
</P>
<P>
   But the newly emboldened KLA is now presenting a problem for
NATO as its peacekeepers seek to prevent acts of revenge like that
which took place in Stari Kacanik.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, it was a peaceful farming village with about 300
ethnic Albanian families and about 30 ethnic Serb or Croatian
families. Some of the non-Albanians had been resettled here in the
mid-1990s. It was part of a Yugoslavian government program by which
some Serbs and Croatians forced to leave Croatia in 1995 were
assigned four-acre plots to farm in some Kosovar villages.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday morning, the Albanians had the village all to
themselves. But as they re-entered the houses that Serbian soldiers
had occupied for at least the last three months, they noticed that
their closets had been ransacked and their TV sets, VCRs, tools and
best clothes had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall of one Albanian house was scrawled what appeared to
be the name of a Serbian Army unit that camped in this village:
Niski Number 8.
</P>
<P>
   Littered around the living room were beer bottles and coffee
cups and a tally sheet for a card game the Yugoslav soldiers may
have played before departing Sunday under the NATO-imposed peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Outside on the courtyard wall was a chalked slogan in Serbian:
``Death to Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked how they felt about seeing the Serbian
civilians follow the troops and police in departing Stari Kacanik,
a half-dozen Albanians interviewed were unanimous in saying they
were happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I am angry with the Serbs,'' said Shkurte's sister,
Melvide Deda, 18. ``But now I am safe, maybe I will forget.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Story can end here. Optional add follows &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovar Albanians living here said they considered many _
perhaps all _ of their former Serbian neighbors accomplices of the
departed Yugoslav soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   One family leader, Hamdi Deda, 43, said: ``The Albanians are not
the people who don't want to live together with the Serbs. Nobody
said they had to leave. But they know what was done, so they
decided they couldn't stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no independent verification of exactly what the
returning KLA rebels told the Serbian villagers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, one fact in the Serbian villagers' version can be
confirmed: on Monday, the KLA moved in on the heels of the
departing Yugoslavian Army contingent and soon fired repeated
bursts of Kalashnikov bullets into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy about NATO coming to rescue our country, so we
celebrated by firing,'' said KLA soldier Sadiq Alieu, one of three
KLA soldiers who acknowledged that at least a few shots were fired
into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest American peacekeeper, Sgt. Allen McDonald, 29, of
Jonesboro, Ark., was stationed on a tank of the First Armored
Division guarding a highway intersection about one mile from the
village.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were multiple bursts of shooting throughout the day
(Monday),'' said McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the participants, perhaps the most forlorn were the ten
members of a Croatian-origin farm family who were found huddled on
their horse-drawn cart as part of the northbound convoy from Stari
Kacanik to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the second or third time we have become refugees,''
said Milan Pajic, 43. ``My father was driven out of his home at the
time of Hitler. In 1946, he returned to Croatia to make a new
family. But then in 1995, authorities in Croatia deported our
family to Kosovo. And now the KLA wants to deport all Serbs from
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about his predicament, Pajic said, ``My heart
is very much destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   (Albright reported from Stari Kacanik. Kaplow reported from
Prizren).

BURROUGHS WOULD LIKE ANIMATED `TARZAN' 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There have been 48 Tarzan movies, but the
rollicking new version from Disney is the first to ever take the
Lord of the Jungle into the world of animation. Edgar Rice
Burroughs, the character's creator, apparently dreamed of an
animated Tarzan, going so far as to tell his son in a letter, ``The
cartoon must be good. It must approximate Disney excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least, that's the version according to Disney.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Tarzan,'' the studio's 37th feature-length effort, does
approach Uncle Walt's cartoon excellence for much of its 88
minutes, particularly in the way it imagines its legendary title
character. This is a Tarzan that Burroughs would love, one who
moves like an animal (a visiting hunter mistakes him for the
``missing link'') and slides through the jungle like a surfer
riding a wave. It's the most fully realized Tarzan we've ever seen,
if only because Johnny Weissmuller simply wasn't physically capable
of performing the sort of feats that Burroughs described in his
books.
</P>
<P>
   This being an animated film, the Disney Tarzan can also do one
other important thing that Weissmuller never could _ talk to the
animals. And they talk back. Of course, for better or worse, that
means that this movie follows the Disney formula of having cute
animal sidekicks on board as comic sidekicks (and merchandising
gold mines). Thus we have Tarzan's obnoxious little ape pal, Terk
(gratingly voiced by Rosie O'Donnell) and a mischievous elephant
named Tantor (``Seinfeld's'' Wayne Knight).
</P>
<P>
   And this being a Disney animated film, we have the requisite
Important Lessons to be learned, themes that once again revolve
around family, acceptance and self-worth. Unfortunately, these
issues are explored so quickly and superficially that their
resolution will likely only resonate with the younger set, who will
no doubt appreciate having everything spelled out for them right
down to the smallest detail.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``Tarzan'' marks a triumphant return to the type of
``Lion King'' accessibility that parents of smaller children will
undoubtedly appreciate. Unlike, say, the sexually charged
``Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' this is not a movie that will prompt
many questions revolving around the birds and the bees. (Unless
they happen to pop up in the movie's emerald green jungle.)
</P>
<P>
   The film's first half-hour finds Tarzan in the jungle as an
orphaned young infant. (Be warned: Disney scores the hat trick in
killing off parental figures in this feature.) A female gorilla,
Kala (tenderly voiced by Glenn Close), who has recently lost her
own child, adopts him _ much to the dismay of her mate, Kerchak
(Lance Henriksen), the leader of the gorillas. ``He's not our
kind,'' Kerchak protests.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, as Tarzan (Alex Linz handles the vocal chores for
the young Tarzan; Tony Goldwyn voices the older version) grows up,
he wonders why he's so different from the others. This doesn't stop
him from learning to swing (through the jungle) and commune as an
equal with the animals, though.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing he doesn't do is break out in song. Directors
Kevin Lima and Chris Buck have wisely decided to use Phil Collins'
songs as background to the story rather than have the ape man do a
soft shoe in his loincloth. There's a particularly effective
sequence where we watch Tarzan the tyke become Lord of the Jungle
to the propulsive and melodic beat of Collins' ``Son of Man.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's conflict comes when the humans arrive. There's Jane,
of course, (deftly voiced by Minnie Driver), her professor father
(Nigel Hawthorne) and a one-note villain (Brian Blessed) who shoots
first and asks questions later. Tarzan finds himself strangely
attracted to these creatures, particularly Jane, and soon enough
finds himself dreaming up monkey business that has nothing to do
with his gorilla buddies. Eventually, he must choose camps _ apes
or humans.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's chief pleasure is the animation, particularly the
sequences that show Tarzan's perspective as he flies through the
jungle. (Think of the front-row view from a roller coaster, and you
get the sensation.) Tarzan himself is remarkably drawn by artist
Glen Keane as a compelling jumble of chin, shoulders and thighs.
He's one of the most vivid characters ever to appear in a Disney
animated film.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Burroughs deserves much of the credit for that.
Tarzan, for good reason, remains one of the most permanently fixed
characters in movie history. If this Tarzan doesn't quite measure
up to the Lord of the Jungle legend, he comes close enough. He'll
certainly be lord of your child's toy chest for the rest of the
summer. &UR;  &QL;

DVD MAY MAKE FILM SCHOLARS OF US ALL
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 20)  
(nk) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 20 years home video has thrived on a simple process: choose
a movie, watch it, engage in some thought and discussion, move on.
(What else do most people do with a movie?) Now, though, operating
on the principle that nothing gets simpler, along comes the digital
video disk (DVD) to immerse one in films to a degree that will
intrigue some and repel others.
</P>
<P>
   DVD invites the average viewer to become a film buff, defined as
one who wants to know all about how the movie was made and by whom.
Before DVD, enthusiasts in want of that kind of information relied
on the stately 12-inch laser disk, which often included sidebar
material about a film. At roughly 5 inches, the DVD is the same
size as a compact disk, but being a digital video medium (laser is
analog) it has vastly larger amounts of space for such extras:
feature-length commentary by filmmakers presented as a sort of
play-by-play as the movie runs, deleted scenes and alternative
endings discarded by the director, cast biographies and interviews
with actors, documentaries about the making of the film, trailers,
scripts, storyboards, production notes, set designs and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Not all DVD's have all of these items, or anywhere near all, but
most disks have at least a couple. The new reigning added-features
champion appears to be ``Ghostbusters,'' to be released June 29 by
Columbia Tri-Star. On that disk the director Ivan Reitman, the
actor Harold Ramis and the producer Joe Medjuck appear in
silhouette as they deliver a commentary. There will also be a
split-screen comparison of the film with its original storyboards,
a separate version of the film annotated with subtitles drawn from
a book about the making of ``Ghostbusters'' and ``animated 3-D
menus.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of all this, the disks work in newer computers equipped
with DVD-ROM drive (not be confused with the CD-ROM drive in most
machines). Plug in the DVD and connect to the Web for even more
features like chat rooms and live events organized around the film.
At the ``Ghostbusters'' site, the original shooting script will be
``hyperlinked'' to the film to allow viewers to jump from one to
the other and compare every little detail.
</P>
<P>
   But who has the interest or time for this kind of thing? Of
course, one remains free to ignore all the added features and just
watch the movie. But including these extras presupposes an audience
for them, and the question becomes to what extent is the general
public as obsessive about cinematographic trivia as the true
collector, scholar or fan? Except the film fetishist, who has the
motivation for endless rumination and reconsideration of what
usually is, after all, a pop-culture product?
</P>
<P>
   In any event, all of this is a far cry from lugging home a
couple of videos. The reasons are mercantile: DVD is video's great
leap forward, with a more up-to-date packaged product to counter an
expected rush of movies into the home from cable, satellite and
other broad band services. Whether consumers avail themselves of
all the features may not matter much. ``People like the fact that
they're available,'' said Benjamin Feingold, president of Columbia
Tri-Star Home Video.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that most people are perfectly satisfied with their
tapes and VCR's. It is also true, however, that after a sputtering
start in 1997, DVD has had a faster rate of growth than the audio
CD or the VCR had when they were introduced in the early '80s, and
that DVD is expected to be in four million households by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   To date, though, the disk owes its success not to extras but to
sharpness and clarity of image. DVD is strikingly superior to
videotape and outdoes the laser disk, which was also far better
than tape. That helps with big visual films _ action movies are the
biggest sellers _ especially when they're played on newer and
larger television sets. The sound, depending on one's equipment,
can be fuller and richer. Production people say it is better than
in many movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who never before noticed or cared much about clarity and
sharpness of image are beginning to appreciate a good picture when
they see one. ``In our minds, 75 percent of the appeal is title and
audio and video quality, not the extra features,'' said David
Miller, director of DVD development at MGM.
</P>
<P>
   Title supply is critical. If it hopes to enter the mainstream,
DVD needs to have big movies available as soon as they appear on
cassette. About 2,900 titles are out on DVD (some mail order
sources list 60,000 tapes or more), with about 250 a month being
added. For the most part, studios are releasing new movies quickly,
but now and then some of the biggest films are delayed.
``Titanic,'' for example, won't appear until September, a year
after its release on tape. ``Saving Private Ryan'' is now out on
cassette, but there has been no announcement about DVD. Reasons are
various, but some studios and directors (including Steven
Spielberg, director of ``Saving Private Ryan'') are said to have
withheld films to see whether DVD would catch on sufficiently to
warrant their release.
</P>
<P>
   Older films are another proposition. It has always been supposed
that the studios would embrace DVD as another means of selling
their libraries all over again. While that spirit prevails to some
extent, the supply of old movies has been selective. MGM, for
instance, concentrates on the big action and sci-fi epics, from
James Bond to ``The Great Escape,'' and the best-known classics,
from ``Singin' in the Rain'' to ``Raging Bull.'' The reason, Miller
said, is that the DVD audience has spread beyond enthusiasts who
collect everything on laser disk to include people who appreciate
quality but aren't buffs or collectors. ``They like good-looking,
good-sounding movies, but they aren't library builders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Extra features add another layer of selectivity. Not every great
old film warrants them.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Key Largo,' for example, is a must for serious collectors,
but not for others despite what you do,'' Miller said. On the other
hand, ``Thelma and Louise,'' about two women on a fatal ride to
Pyrrhic liberation, has enough broad appeal to warrant a
full-length commentary by the director, Ridley Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Producers say the extras will become an acquired taste once DVD
has been around for a while. ``The average DVD viewer has just
traded up from a VCR,'' said David Goodman, president of DVD
International, a disk producer in New Jersey. ``On tape the color
red was purple or the color blue was green. It didn't matter.
Quality was never an issue. Now people are still getting over how
good video can be. The next phase will be, let's explore it and see
what it does.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Extras may not yet excite the mainstream, but they can be fun
and instructive. In the thriller ``Ronin,'' a best seller on
digital video disk, two carloads of mercenaries barrel over a
divider and scream off at speeds approaching 100 mph. That's
stepping on it, all right, and there's a complication. Having
landed on the wrong side of the highway, they are going against
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 300 stunt drivers coming at us,'' says John
Frankenheimer, the film's director, in his full-length commentary.
``You can see with the suspensions working on these cars, nothing's
fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer, whose films range from from ``The Manchurian
Candidate'' to ``French Connection II,'' drove race cars himself
once and specializes in the car chase. This one was staged in
Paris. The French, he says on the disk, closed off large portions
of the city for the film. Most of the drivers had experience at Le
Mans.
</P>
<P>
   At the wheel of the pursuing vehicle, looking determined but
definitely as if he wished he were elsewhere, is Robert De Niro.
Actually, Frankenheimer explains, in many of the chase shots the
wheel is a dummy. The real wheel is on the other side of the car
and in the hands of a French Grand Prix driver. Car chases, and
there are several hair-raising ones in ``Ronin,'' are plotted
painstakingly on storyboards and shot once, using several cameras.
No retakes. Actors are expected to be in the cars and have been
sent to race school to see what it will be like.
</P>
<P>
   British commandos advised on the gun battles. Frankenheimer
talks about quick, clean transitions in dramatic scenes. No
dissolves. And no slow motion in the action sequences. ``Violence
happens fast,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Commentaries by directors can be pedestrian _ particularly when
larding on effusive praise of movie stars _ but they are often
fascinating. Recently DVD International released a fine two-disk
edition of Armistead Maupin's ``More Tales of the City,'' the
acclaimed six-hour mini-series that appeared on Showtime last June.
If a film like ``Ronin'' demonstrates how DVD enhances the big
action movie, ``More Tales'' shows how the format can add insight
into an intimate drama.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Tales of the City,'' its noted and controversial
predecessor on PBS, the series is drawn from Maupin's novels about
life emanating from 28 Barbary Lane, the San Francisco
boardinghouse run by the deeply intuitive transsexual Anna Madrigal
(Olympia Dukakis). During a four-and-a-half-hour commentary spread
across six one-hour episodes, Maupin and others discuss everything
from the show's literary roots to its political difficulties over
sexual content. Three cast members _ Ms. Dukakis, Laura Linney and
Barbara Garrick _ reflect on their characters and the feelings of
family, both fictionally and on the set, that emerged during the
course of two long projects.
</P>
<P>
   Lengthy commentary works well for titles with large followings.
Fans of the show will surely want to watch the series once without
the commentary and then again with it, and take in all the other
extras, which run from deleted scenes to correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to hear the footnotes as to what went on,'' Maupin
said in an interview. ``Until now only books provided that for
people who cared about film.''

REPUBLICAN URGES QUICK BIPARTISAN ACTION ON SOCIAL SECURITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who chairs the House's
chief tax-writing committee, urged his congressional colleagues
Tuesday to forget their partisan ties and work to rescue Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's comments followed the release of a survey Tuesday
revealing that most Americans want quick action by Congress to
preserve Social Security, the federal retirement program that also
provides money to disabled people and surviving dependents.
Republicans and Democrats, fearing political fallout from
constituents, have historically refused to tamper with Social
Security, which faces financial trouble in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to act now,'' said Archer, chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee. ``Every Congress that we wait makes the job
more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   As the baby-boom generation reaches retirement, the system will
begin to pay out more than it collects and faces depletion in 2034,
reported the bipartisan group Americans Discuss Social Security,
which conducted the survey last month.
</P>
<P>
   Privately funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the survey of
1,003 Americans showed 58 percent of U.S. citizens want Congress to
reform Social Security before the 2000 elections. Survey results
also revealed that rescuing Social Security is a top priority of
Americans, trailing only enhancing education and improving health
care.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the findings, Archer pressed lawmakers to ``put principle
above politics and ideas above ambition.'' The Houston Republican
said he will meet privately with GOP and Democratic committee
members Thursday to discuss their proposals for a long-term
solution to the retirement system's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on the ways
and means panel, echoed Archer's call for quick bipartisan action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be an American, congressional plan that's accepted
by the president of the United States,'' Rangel said of a proposed
solution. ``If we can change the (partisan) climate ... I think we
can really get something done.''
</P>
<P>
   In a note of good news for Archer, 58 percent of survey
respondents welcomed his proposal to allow employees to invest some
of their Social Security tax privately rather than pay it all to
the government. Meanwhile, 52 percent of the respondents rejected
President Clinton's counter-proposal that the federal government _
and not employees _ invest Social Security tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential remedy to the looming shortfall _ politically
controversial but popular among survey respondents _ is ``means
testing,'' or reducing the amount of Social Security funds paid to
retirees who receive lucrative private pensions of more than
$60,000 annually. This proposal garnered the support of 58 percent
of the respondents.
</P>
<P>
   A third proposal, favored by 61 percent, would end the payment
exemption for workers receiving annual salaries of more than
$72,600 and require these well-paid employees to begin paying
toward Social Security. But 74 percent of respondents rejected
proposals that would gradually increase the full-benefit retirement
age from 65 to 70.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years, Americans Discuss Social Security
examined the views of a cross section of U.S. citizens regarding
the federal retirement system. The group's May survey revealed that
68 percent of the population believes that everyone will have to
forgo some Social Security benefits to ensure that the program
continues.

 &HT;    Spurs try to keep confidence in check; Knicks' best hope is
getting early lead
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ If you listen to the pundits, it's only a
matter of time before the Spurs are celebrating an NBA championship
at the Alamo. But if you look at what the New York Knicks have done
this postseason, such widespread thinking would be irresponsible at
worst, premature at best.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Finals begin tonight, with many people anticipating
dominance by the San Antonio Spurs. Not to be overlooked is that
the Knicks have displayed a propensity for playing their best when
least expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everyone around here knows we have to go out and win
this championship,'' Spurs center David Robinson said. ``The Knicks
didn't just show up here. They earned the right to be here by
beating some pretty good teams. For us to be overconfident when
you're playing for the NBA championship would be crazy. It'd be a
big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have a formidable chore in front of them. The Spurs
have won 42 of their last 48 games. They swept the Los Angeles
Lakers and the Portland Trailblazers. And they are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   New York's best hope _other than playing outstanding basketball
_- is jumping ahead 1-0 in the series against a team that has
developed some rust from nine days off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't simulate game conditions, especially game conditions
in the finals,'' said Spurs guard Steve Kerr, who experienced the
challenge while playing with the Bulls. ``So, the time off could be
a factor. We've practiced hard. It's just a matter of seeing how we
respond to a game that's far more important than any game most of
the guys have ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Knicks, only backup center Herb Williams, 41, has played
in the finals; the 1994 Knicks lost in seven games to Houston. The
seldom-used Williams, 41, stands to receive playing time tonight if
forward Larry Johnson's sprained right knee keeps him sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has not tried to run or play basketball since going down
in the second quarter of New York's decisive Game 6 of the Eastern
Conference finals against Indiana. His availability figures to be a
significant factor for a team already shorthanded by a
season-ending injury to center Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better today than I did yesterday,'' Johnson said
Tuesday. ``It's a tough situation. To get to the NBA Finals and
then have to watch from the sidelines, to not even be able to
practice _ it's tough. And then if I do come back, I'll be wearing
a bulky brace after five days off, out of rhythm and a little out
of shape. So, all the way around, it's just tough.''
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson's status a game-time decision, coach Jeff Van Gundy
probably will start former regular Kurt Thomas up front with center
Chris Dudley and Latrell Sprewell. Not exactly an imposing trio
against Robinson, Tim Duncan and Sean Elliott _ all former or
current all-stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we still have to play the games,'' said energetic Marcus
Camby, who figures to be a key for the Knicks. ``I don't think
we're a team of destiny; we've just gone out and won the games we
needed to. It's a great story to get where we are after so much
craziness going on, on the court and off it. But we're here, and we
have a chance to add to our great story.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the craziness has been the controversialSprewell, who was
signed and then steamed over his backup role in the regular season;
general manager Ernie Grunfeld, who was fired; and coach Jeff Van
Gundy, whose job has been insecure all year.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' biggest challenge is coping with San Antonio's
peerless inside tandem of Duncan and Robinson. Van Gundy observed
that they usually deter dribble penetration, so he expects outside
shots to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They reduce teams to be jump-shooting teams,'' he said. ``And
then you'll be an inconsistent team, which is why they go on big
runs against teams. So, we're going to have to make some open
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're here. We'll play our game and we'll take our best
shot.''

 &HT;    Anderson, new deal out of Reeves' reach
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves said Tuesday he tried to call
All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson, but the two sides remain far
from an agreement on a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's agent, Jim Sims, said Monday he and Anderson were
looking for signs that talks were ``moving forward'' before the
player attends voluntary passing camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons consider their five-year, $26 million contract offer
as proof their intentions are earnest. That's $1 million shy of the
franchise-record five-year, $27 million contract quarterback Chris
Chandler got last season.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, though, wants more money, and is believed to be
seeking a signing bonus of at least $10 million. The franchise
record is the $6 million bonus Chandler got.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to renegotiate . . . but we're a ways apart,''
Reeves said after a 75-minute session on the second day of the
two-week camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did leave a message, and hopefully I'll talk to him soon.
Whether that will change Jamal's thinking . . . we'll just coach
the ones we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Anderson Tuesday in Salt Lake City failed.
</P>
<P>
   But on his Web site Monday night, he wrote, ``In case anyone
wants to know, the contract situation is going in the right
direction, and I expect to be back in camp any day now.''
</P>
<P>
   Money matters
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons sign Anderson to an extension, the team will have
more cap room available to consider extending some of the other
nine starters who are potential unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is to earn $1.6 million in salary this season and more
than $1 million in incentives earned last season. His charge
against the salary cap, however, is about $3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Because his salary-cap charge already is so high, an extension
probably would drop that number and create more than $1 million in
cap room.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other potential unrestricted free agents have cap
charges low enough that extensions would increase their charges.
</P>
<P>
   Beefing up
</P>
<P>
   Second-year player Bob Hallen continues to work with the first
unit at right guard because of the absence of Gene Williams.
Williams is missing workouts because he is unhappy the team won't
tell him if it plans to extend his contract.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4 Hallen, the team's second-round draft choice in
1998, has added 12-15 pounds and weighs ``about 300 to 305,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Ben Huff, who was on the practice squad last
year, has bulked up about 15 pounds to 300.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are pleased that running backs Byron Hanspard and
Bob Christian are participating in camp while they recover from
knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard tore the anterior cruciate ligament and patellar tendon
in his left knee in the final preseason game last summer.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie in 1997, Hanspard averaged 6.3 yards and had three
of the 12 longest carries in franchise history _ 77, 57 and 53
yards. He also returned two kickoffs for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling a lot better. The Lord has blessed me with great
trainers and strength coaches,'' said Hanspard, who appears to have
no problems changing directions.
</P>
<P>
   Christian partially tore the ACL in his left knee in a Dec. 13
game at New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob appears to have built up the strength in his leg,'' Reeves
said. ``He looks really good.''
</P>

 &HT;    Montgomerie ready to conquer U.S. Open for Europe
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Scotland's Colin Montgomerie brings a new
mindset this week to the U.S. Open, where he often has felt the
heat on both sides of the ropes. After three near-misses in the
major championship he enjoys more than any other, the dominant
player of Europe is calling on help from all challengers on his
side of the pond.
</P>
<P>
   No U.S. Open has been won by a European player since England's
Tony Jacklin in 1971. With that fact in mind, after his initial
tour of Pinehurst No. 2 Tuesday, the 35-year-old Montgomerie seemed
all but ready to hoist a European flag over the Carolina Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The runoffs (of the greens) are quite similar to (the Masters
in) Augusta in many ways,'' Montgomerie said, ``and we've won 11
out of the last 20 of them, so it might well favor the European
player here for the first time in many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie's comments came with a touch of playfulness, but
they were delivered with authority. While there's really no
explaining how Montgomerie can win six consecutive money titles on
the European Tour but go totally winless in America, it's equally
puzzling why the U.S. Open has not been as pleasant as Augusta
National for the Europeans. And enough is enough, Monty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's motivation for every British golfer and also
every European golfer to try and emulate that feat (by Jacklin),''
he said. ``I think it's been too long, really. It's almost 30 years
now. (Nick) Faldo has lost in playoffs, and so have I, so we've
been quite close. It's just a matter of being patient and trying to
walk through when that door is half ajar. It's the point of walking
through it and not finishing second.''
</P>
<P>
   This year could be different. The rough is manageable by USGA
standards, and with creativity around the greens at Pinehurst No. 2
more crucial than driving the ball long and straight, the European
factor could be more noticeable. For those who doubt, remember the
Ryder Cup at Valderrama. And while chipping and putting might not
be Montgomerie's strong suit, it surely finds itself on the resume
of Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of course brings in the possibility of a win for the
likes of a player like Olazabal,'' Montgomerie said, ``who might
not hit the ball as straight off some of the tees. These fairways
are giving him more of a chance of doing that, and to use his
enormous talent around the greens, and his imagination, which this
will take.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Montgomerie's chances could again depend on outside
forces. American crowds have never warmed to him, unfortunately,
and on several occasions they have shouted insults. Last year,
David Duval and Jim Furyk said they were embarrassed by fan
comments to the Scot, who actually is one of the more likeable
players around.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Monty does not let the crowd get to him,'' Olazabal
said, ``he's got to have a great chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he is perceived by American audiences and why they
have not warmed to him, Montgomerie played dumb to the question,
but he recognized it as a no-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really thought about it, to be honest,'' he said,
smiling. ``Such a good question, you've stumped me. . . . I really
do feel I get similar treatment to any other European or foreign
player that comes over to America.''
</P>
<P>
   For certain, Montgomerie's game could not be much sharper. He
won twice in three weeks in Europe, including a smashing Sunday at
the Volvo PGA Championship with a closing 64.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colin is probably playing the best he has ever played, and
that's saying a lot,'' Ernie Els said. ``He is just lapping the
field, and the way he is playing now he will probably win a major.
``
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie came into Congressional two years ago on a similar
run and opened with a 65, eventually finishing second to Els.
Although much has been made of the seven-footer for par that
Montgomerie missed at the 71st hole, after a long wait because of
rowdy fans, his real demise that week was a second-round 76. He
calls the opening 65 ``as good as I can play,'' but he termed the
64 two weeks ago at Wentworth nearly as fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just haven't managed to find the necessary form for four
days,'' Monty said. ``I did it for three at Congressional and threw
in a 76 in the second round. You can't afford to do that. . . .
It's just a matter of trying to maintain form and confidence,
because the game is there. I've just got to go out with the same
belief that I take into the European tournaments, and hopefully it
will work out.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, Montgomerie's putting will have to be near-perfect. When
he tied Steve Elkington in the 1995 PGA at Riviera, eventually
losing the playoff, he had used 17 putts more than the Australian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never blamed my long game,'' Monty said. ``I just haven't
holed out as well as the winner has.

GEORGES HUGNET, SURREALIST OF MANY TALENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 20)  
(mk) 
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Surrealism, generally thought of as melting watches
and men in bowler hats descending from the sky, began as a literary
movement. In 1924, when the writer Andre Breton published his
``Manifeste du Surrealisme,'' he didn't bother to mention visual
artists until he got to the footnotes. This was troubling. Some in
the movement were not certain that painting could match Breton's
``pure psychic automatism'' of verbal expression, which he
described as going beyond the constraints of reason and ``beyond
any aesthetic or moral preoccupation.''
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of years, painting that engaged in automatism and
courted dreams squeaked through the Surrealist door as well. Today
the painters _ Salvador Dali, Rene Magritte, Max Ernst, Joan Miro
and Yves Tanguey, among others _ are thought to have stolen the
movement away and run off with the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the group around Breton had several talents, and they
collaborated with one another just about every other Wednesday,
photographing one another, making films and founding magazines
together, writing articles for their friends, illustrating one
another's books. Lots of books. The movement in its heyday always
had a literary bent _ a wide angle, in fact, to judge by the large
number of remarkable book illustrations and covers on view in
``Surrealism: Two Private Eyes,'' an exhibition at the Guggenheim
Museum running through Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   For a more concentrated view of the literary/artistic side of
the movement, the Zabriskie Gallery on 57th Street is offering,
through July 16, ``Georges Hugnet (1906-1974): Collages,'' a show
of 37 collages made by Hugnet between 1936 and 1961 plus multiple
copies of three of his books, enabling both the covers and some of
the illustrations to be shown.
</P>
<P>
   Both the published and the unpublished collages reveal a tasty
sense of humor, the standard Surrealist obsession with naked women
and the required Surrealist penchant for highly improbable
meetings. Hugnet also had a positively saucy sense of naughtiness.
Put him next to the French Surrealist Pierre Molinier or the Czech
Jindrich Styrsky at the Guggenheim (not to mention Robert
Mapplethorpe or Nan Goldin more recently), and Hugnet's petites
scandales begin to look faintly Victorian.
</P>
<P>
   In his visions, there are goats that pursue a nude who is trying
to squeeze through the window of a cottage, a penguin that appears
to lift the skirt of a woman whose head is a metal disk with bunny
ears of fabric, and a bra and half slip that proudly stand in the
air before an erupting volcano. In the 1940s, Hugnet was rather
more explicit in a project called ``La Vie Amoureuse des
Spumifieres'' (``The Love Life of the Spumifieres''), in which he
used risque Victorian postcards, drawing over them strange little
creatures, half insect and wholly libidinous.
</P>
<P>
   His 1936 book, ``Septieme Face du De'' (``Seventh Face of the
Die''), scatters across a page cutouts of photographs and printed
phrases from magazines, making a kind of collage poetry. The words
form a kind of ``exquisite corpse,'' a game best known for the mad
drawings that resulted when a piece of paper was folded in three
and three people then drew pictures on it of adjoining parts of the
body, from the head down, without knowing what the previous part
looked like.
</P>
<P>
   The game had actually begun as a word game, with three or four
people completing sentences without knowing how they started.
Hugnet cut his words and phrases from periodicals and assembled
them as if they were the babblings of a poet after a particularly
delicate dose of peyote: ``Will someone elucidate a rainbow?''
``Because it's the sun that's wrong Because a heel can be compared
to a young woman who dreams of love.''
</P>
<P>
   This method involved more rational choice _ something the
Surrealists claimed not to value highly _ than a true exquisite
corpse does. Hugnet knew what came before. Well, maybe he threw a
lot of phrases into the air and let chance take them wandering, but
if so, he cheated afterward. Chance is seldom so poetic, or so
grammatical. Whichever, the result is a kind of free association
that would drive an analyst to drink or, worse yet, to
deconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   In the book ``Huit Jours a Trebaumec'' (``Eight Days in
Trebaumec''), Hugnet spoofed both the Guide Michelin and
traditional travel diaries. He recounted a trip that Lewis Carroll
might have booked: When their hostess danced an ancient Celtic
dance called the Hair-do on the beach, he illustrated it with a
``snapshot'' of two heads of hair atop one pair of legs that seem
to have misplaced their torso and arms yet can gaily dance in high
heels at the edge of the surf.
</P>
<P>
   Hugnet designed a choice book cover _ it's on display at the
Guggenheim _ for Hans Bellmer's photographs of his notorious doll,
a female mannequin with removable parts that Bellmer removed or
multiplied to sinister effect. Both the front and back covers of
this book sport an actual pink garter with a bit of white lace
above and a bit of black stocking below. In one of his own
collages, Hugnet used a favorite form of Bellmer's: two pairs of
female legs atop each other, one right side up, the other upside
down.
</P>
<P>
   Bellmer's doubled legs _ women without bodies, defiantly
artificial in Mary Janes _ seem severed, slightly monstrous,
borderline schizophrenic. Hugnet's leg-women _ full-color
photographs clipped from magazines _ have downright perky
personalities in comparison; they're sweet, they're cute, they wear
taffeta skirts. Bellmer and Hugnet deserve a certain dubious amount
of credit for discovering that legs have personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil Thomson described Hugnet as ``small, truculent and
sentimental,'' a man of outrageous and, if you liked outrage,
hilarious conversation. Sounds like just the personality for that
febrile group of artists in the '30s. He will probably not be
remembered as a major player in Surrealism, partly because he was
not a painter, but he had plenty of talent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of talents, actually. A poet, at age 14 he so impressed
the writer Max Jacob that Jacob introduced him to Cocteau, Picasso,
Duchamp, Ernst, Calder and the rest of his group. Duchamp later did
covers for two editions of a Hugnet book, and Dali did a
frontispiece for another. Hugnet wrote early and widely on
contemporary art, including the preface to the Museum of Modern
Art's 1936 show ``Fantastic Art, Dada, and Surrealism.'' He is
probably assured his own firm place in the history of art as a
historian of Dada and Surrealism, and a minor place in the history
of Surrealism for the charm of his art as well.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote the script for a 1929 film called ``La Perle'' and
starred in it, wrote plays, translated Gertrude Stein into French,
founded his own publishing house and his own literary review,
collected art and popular objects, was an art dealer for a while
and a rare book dealer for another, designed book covers and made a
multitude of collages. Virgil Thomson set some of his poems to
music.
</P>
<P>
   Visual collage seems like child's play now, as do mobiles, which
once upon a time, before Alexander Calder made them look easy, were
not made by elementary school children. Photographic collage, which
goes back to the 19th century, is embedded in 20th-century life.
The art critic Harold Rosenberg once remarked that the photographic
esthetic of finding _ the photographer combing the world for
subjects worth dignifying _ had had an immense influence on
contemporary culture, from the spread of insatiable collecting to
the massive revision of art through incorporation of real-world
objects and representations in collage and assemblage.
</P>
<P>
   He might have noted that the commercial districts of modern
cities, and modern highways that have not yet retired their
billboards, present variations on collage, with phrases on one sign
abutting unrelated phrases on the next, and photographs and
drawings in wildly disparate styles cut into appropriate shapes for
display, then pasted on the sides of buildings and buses, phone
booths, newsstands and store windows.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know what to call a collage that moves, but we have
that too, as people wearing photographic portraits and logos and
cartoon heroes on their T-shirts pass one another on the street,
and stacked television sets showing the same program perform their
Nam June Paik imitations in the aisles of Nobody Beats the Wiz.
Times Square is simply an overgrown collage that blinks. The
computer has made cutting and pasting so easy that everyone may yet
be Georges Hugnet.
</P>
<P>
   The Surrealist impulse (which goes beyond collage but which
collage readily satisfies) has been unusually tenacious because
even during working hours our streets are full of sewing machines,
umbrellas and dissecting tables. Lost souls cry for spare change in
front of boutiques selling diamonds as big as the Ritz. A woman
covered head to foot with blue makeup brushes her hair in a store
window on Fifth Avenue. Not to mention the great TV surfing
experience, where the click of a button transports you from cartoon
rabbits with big teeth to threatening lady preachers, from Serb
atrocities to Ricky Martin kissing passionately even as he sings in
the background.
</P>
<P>
   Television really ought to have put Surrealism to bed, but
instead it has kept it awake for 24 hours at a time, and
computer-driven special effects have pumped up the remains of that
literary and artistic movement with infusions of grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Hugnet was more modest _ and more amusing. The Surrealists may
not have been any more ambitious than other artists (which is
ambitious enough), but they succeeded even beyond their own daft
dreams, by infiltrating the environment and leaving their impress
on the whole of modern life.

TEXAS GOVERNOR WINDS UP FIRST CAMPAIGN SWING WITH RAVE REVIEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DERRY, N.H. _ The welcome sign outside Madden's Family
Restaurant on Tuesday pretty well summed up the campaign debut of
Gov. George W. Bush: ``Wow! What a start!''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush's opponents acknowledged that the Texas Republican's
initial foray to Iowa and New Hampshire confirmed his front-runner
status in the race for the GOP presidential nomination. It wasn't a
flawless performance, but Bush's four-day campaign blitz did not
disappoint supporters with sky-high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   At stop after stop, the first-time presidential candidate
generated the kind of enthusiasm and media attention that typically
occurs in the closing days of a primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One New Hampshire newspaper dubbed the governor's whirlwind tour
``Hurricane Bush.'' His GOP rivals can only hope that the winds die
down before they get flattened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the Second Coming, but I don't think so,'' said
Keith Fortmann, who is directing former Vice President Dan Quayle's
Iowa campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After a final day of campaigning in New Hampshire, Bush ended
his first outing with side trips to fund-raisers in Boston and
Greenwich, Conn. Organizers said the Boston event raised more than
$800,000, a record for a Republican in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But the real point of Bush's trip was to test his appeal to
voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, the traditional leadoff states
for presidential politics. Bush ended his New Hampshire visit with
the kind of one-on-one campaigning that the state is known for.
</P>
<P>
   Although his Texas drawl may sound foreign to New Hampshire
ears, Bush's hands-on campaign style seemed to impress shift
workers at HADCO Corp., a circuit board manufacturing plant in
Derry. The media horde following Bush complicated his efforts to
meet face-to-face with voters, but it also added to the feeling
that he is not just another presidential long-shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems like a down-to-earth kind of guy,'' worker Bill Brown
said after Bush joined Brown and some friends at a picnic table
just before shift change. ``I really didn't expect him to come sit
down with us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the nearby Madden's restaurant, Bush grabbed a coffee pot and
filled diners' cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only governor I've had pour coffee for me,'' said a
delighted Jerry Muzzey of Hooksett.
</P>
<P>
   But many of Bush's fans conceded that they know little about his
political views. Bush deliberately avoided specifics on his first
trip, saying that he wanted to focus on broad concepts.
</P>
<P>
   On one issue that he did address head-on, abortion, the governor
may have hurt his standing with some anti-abortion activists. Bush
said he would not use an anti-abortion litmus test in selecting
Supreme Court nominees.
</P>

 &HT;    Clinton calls on Congress to pass tougher gun legislation
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the House set to open an emotional debate on
teens and violence today, President Clinton on Tuesday pleaded with
Congress to enact new laws to keep guns out of the hands of
juveniles and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In a Rose Garden ceremony attended by families of children
killed in gun violence, Clinton urged members of Congress to reject
the strong-arm tactics of the gun lobby and strengthen the 1993
Brady bill, requiring criminal background checks for handgun
purchases, to also include gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has another vitally important choice before it,''
Clinton said. ``Are they going to strengthen the Brady bill or
weaken it? The Brady law has worked. It's worked so well, in fact,
that criminals now have to buy their weapons at places not fully
covered by the gun laws, like gun shows and flea markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton released new Justice Department figures showing that the
Brady bill and subsequent instant background checks system that
went into effect last year had prevented more than 400,000 firearms
from falling into the hands of people barred by law from having
them. Two-third of those denied guns had felony convictions or
indictments, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Republican leaders wrestled with how
to structure the floor debate on the proposed gun control measures
and a raft of other proposals geared toward dismantling the
``culture of violence'' that young people are exposed to in movies,
television shows and video games.
</P>
<P>
   The House will debate the gun control provisions, including
requirements that guns be sold with trigger locks and a new ban on
large ammunition clips, either today or Thursday. Members will vote
on scores of amendments, but the bulk of the debate will be focused
on how best to close the so-called gun show loophole.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment offered by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.), whose
husband was gunned down in a train shooting in 1993, would closely
mirror language adopted by the Senate, giving law enforcement three
business days to conduct criminal background checks at gun shows.
It would also require sellers to collect information on buyers that
could be used to trace the guns sold. Clinton and many other
Democrats back this language.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and Rep. Bill McCollum
(R-Fla.) have another alternative that would require background
checks, but allow law enforcement three consecutive days to do
them. It would also exempt small gatherings of gun sellers from the
requirements and allow dealers to ship guns across state lines,
which they have been barred from doing since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   A third option, sponsored by Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) and
other conservative Democrats, would weaken the Hyde bill even
further by reducing the 72 hour time for checks to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   With the deep ideological divisions in the House, few House
leaders were willing to predict the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell where the votes will be,'' said Rep. Dick
Armey (R-Texas), the House majority leader, adding he might support
the Dingell alternative. ``Neither side is going to win. Everybody
understands that every individual member has got to come to terms
with themselves and their district on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also acknowledged that it will be tough for the House to
vote for new gun control, even though most Americans support new
restrictions in the wake of the shootings at high schools in
Colorado and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our members who desperately want to vote for this bill
come from congressional districts which are less populous than
almost all states, and where the influence of the NRA and their
ability to promote scare tactics and misinformation is relatively
greater,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents and proponents of new restrictions on the types of
movies, video games and literature available to juveniles also
geared up for today's floor debate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) and several other GOP lawmakers
pushed a sense of Congress resolution calling on the entertainment
industry to stop portrayals of ``gratuitous violence in movies,
television, music and video games.''
</P>
<P>
   Displaying a graphic ad for a game called, ``You're gonna die,''
Kingston chided Congress for focusing on guns at the exclusion of
other societal pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate has been focused on the National Rifle
Association...and sidestepped the issue of violence on
television,'' said Kingston, who opposes new gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.), meanwhile, assailed Hyde for his
proposal to hold the distributors of violent video games and movies
responsible for distributing the material to juveniles 17 and
younger. Hyde's proposal calls for five year sentences for those
who knowingly break the law, and would also require music stores to
provide copies of song lyrics to parents who want to see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Republican, I thought our party was committed to
lessening government interference in the affairs of commerce and
our personal lives,'' said Foley, chairman of the Republican
Entertainment Task Force. ``This reckless proposal would
dramatically increase the power of the federal government in far
too many areas.''

 &HT;    ROSA PARKS AWARDED CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hailed as the ``mother of the civil rights
movement,'' Rosa Parks received the Congressional Gold Medal on
Tuesday in a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   Parks's activism during the civil rights movement and in the
years since were recounted by a panoply of leaders that included
President Clinton, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and the
Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Julia Carson, D-Ind., recalled Parks's famous refusal to
give up her bus seat to a white man in December 1955, which sparked
the Montgomery bus boycott and lent a major impetus to the civil
rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Parks to the biblical Job, ``unmovable and
unshakable,'' Carson said the medal is a celebration of Parks's
life, and she is grateful that it could be presented ``while she
can still feel it and while she can still see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson introduced the measure honoring Parks on Feb. 4. It was
approved unanimously by the Senate and by a vote of 424-1 in the
House, where Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, said he opposed spending
federal funds on such awards.
</P>
<P>
   Parks, 86, who now lives in Detroit, thanked all of the people
who participated in the bus boycott nearly 44 years ago and urged
everyone to ``continue until all people have equal rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., said that Parks's arrest was
intended to show that Alabama would not tolerate defiance against
its segregationist laws, but instead sent an entirely different
message _ ``that people would no longer tolerate second-class
citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that he was 9 when Parks committed her act of
defiance, and that he and some of his friends were so impressed
that ``we began to sit on the back of the bus when we got on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor the country can
bestow on a civilian, has in recent years been awarded to Mother
Teresa, Frank Sinatra, Winston Churchill and most recently, Nelson
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said it is only
fitting that Parks follow Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   ``She helped break the same chains that held back millions of
Americans simply because of the color of their skin,'' Gephardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., recalled that rays
of sunlight shone upon the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in
the Rotunda as Mandela began to speak after receiving his medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked, for an instant, like Dr. King had come back to life
and was smiling at what he was seeing,'' Daschle said. ``I believe
Dr. King is smiling again today.''

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ In Silicon Valley, these are the days of
miracles and wonder.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the longest sustained boom in the nation's
high-technology heartland, there is a palpable air of unreality
that has come to color the outlook of the computer engineers,
venture capitalists and software hackers who make up the valley's
rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Wage rates in the region are about 60 percent above the national
average and are growing far more quickly than average. Driven by
the vast new wealth created by a wave of Internet-related start-up
companies and the increasingly vast inflows of venture capital,
good times have arrived with a vengeance and have stayed longer
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The good times have led so many valley workers to sports car
showrooms that Raymond Lane, the president of Oracle, the giant
data base company, complained recently that he could not find the
new Porsche he wanted in Northern California; one local dealership
had a six-month waiting list. (He ordered one from a Southern
California dealer through the Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   And in meetings at power breakfast spots in Palo Alto like Il
Fornaio or Bucks in Woodside, executives shake their heads over
stories such as the one about the home in a comfortable Palo Alto
neighborhood that sold in April for $1 million more than the $2.4
million asking price.
</P>
<P>
   But indicators like those have in turn led to a growing sense of
unease among many valley longtimers who oscillate between a faith
in what has been called the ``long boom'' and the knowledge that
each of the valley's booms in the last half-century has inevitably
been followed by a bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valley is now divided into two camps,'' said John Shoch, a
partner at Alloy Ventures, a venture capital firm based in Palo
Alto. ``There are those people who are firmly inside a
reality-distortion field and there are the rest of us who realize
that this is going to end but who can't help going along for the
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk at the restaurants and sports clubs is frequently of
the power of ``Yahoo dollars'' or ``Weimar currencies,'' the fruits
of a stock market that seems to have a bottomless appetite for
Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, stock certificates have in many ways become the
currency of the valley _ to such an extent that the Menlo Park
Presbyterian Church receives a significant share of its tithing in
stock instead of money. And St. Joseph's, a Roman Catholic school
in Atherton, devotes part of its endowment to its own venture
capital fund.
</P>
<P>
   While the booming stock values have allowed companies to attract
and retain the best and brightest employees and acquire other
companies, there is also a growing perception that the excesses of
the Internet commerce boom may have permanently undermined the
valley's traditional no-nonsense, utilitarian, engineering-driven
culture.
</P>
<P>
   At the Palo Alto office of R.R. Donnelley, the venerable
printing company that publishes the financial documents known as
``red herrings'' that are a key part of the rite of going public,
the valet parking, the pool table and the cigars in a thermidor
occasion more than one raised eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   And such is the cash rattling around that an editor at the
high-speed Internet service At Home recently purchased a new
$625,000 home on his debit card.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one consensus is that this unrivaled wealth creation has
led to a stock market bubble that will certainly end, but nobody
knows when or how.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who are making the case that the
Internet has changed the law of physics,'' said Fred Hoar, a
longtime Silicon Valley publicist. ``But this is still a Newtonian
world, and when you throw something up in this world, it's going to
come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring that point, the book that is on everyone's lips is
not a Silicon Valley best seller like Geoffrey Moore's ``Crossing
the Chasm,'' but rather Charles MacKay's 1841 book ``Extraordinary
Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds,'' which among other
events described the Dutch tulip speculative craze of the 1600s, a
legendary example of a market mania.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what has made the current boom so unusual is that it
has gone on for so long. It has been more than six years since the
valley has seen tough times, a fact that has caused memories here
to grow hazy and has led some longtimers here to look for ways to
cling to a past that seems increasingly distant.
</P>
<P>
   Roger McNamee, a fund manager at Interval Partners in Menlo
Park, has followed the valley's ups and downs since the beginning
of the PC era. Now he points across a parking lot at his Toyota
Camry, a modest car contrasting with the more typical turbo-charged
luxury cars. He says he hangs onto the car as a touchstone to a
world he is in danger of losing contact with.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and researchers who are trying to understand the
apparent disappearance of the valley's boom-and-bust cycle point to
the convergence of two separate trends that set the economy into a
sustained period of overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   The semiconductor industry, which has long been the bedrock of
the Silicon Valley economy, was just beginning to recover in 1993
when the demand for Internet communications gear started its rapid
acceleration. Then in 1995 the Web economy kicked in, creating a
remarkable business spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it was coincident with the commercialization of the
Internet,'' said Douglas Henton, president of Collaborative
Economics, a consulting firm in Palo Alto. ``But the real growth in
jobs has been in computer networking.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet, although there have been booms before, this one has
permanently altered the valley's entrepreneurial culture, in ways
that are viewed as negative by many of the region's longtimers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a corrosive effect on the valley parallel to Wall Street
in the mid-1980's,'' said Eric Schmidt, who was the chief
technology officer at Sun Microsystems before decamping to Utah two
years ago as president and chief executive of Novell. ``The level
of expectation is well beyond the norm, even in Silicon Valley.
People have very short attention spans when it comes to their
careers. It is a youth phenomenon, a new generation of
entrepreneurs who have not had to concentrate on building
institutions that endure. Moreover, the venture industry has no
longer had to build a long-term business. The corrosive effect is
in creating a short-term versus long-term way of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   And the wild successes of Stanford students like Jerry Yang of
Yahoo or Joe Kraus of Excite have now made it common for graduates
to choose Silicon Valley start-ups first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today 75 percent of my students are joining emerging
companies,'' said John Hennessey, the dean of the school of
engineering at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   That is a sharp turn from the days when the normal career
pattern was to join an established high-technology company like
Hewlett-Packard or Intel before setting out on a start-up venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got this funny psychology in which the reality and the
unreality coexist,'' said Michael Borrus, a managing director at
Petkovich &AMP; Partners, a San Francisco investment firm. ``These kids
really believe they're going to get wealthy and this youthful
optimism is overriding the fact that maybe 9 out of 10 of them
won't have an IPO in their lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, an economy in which several generations of new
workers have never known anything but explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the semiconductor, we've known historically that every four
years we get hit cross the lip,'' said Hoar, the publicist, who was
an early employee at Fairchild Semiconductor, a pioneering chip
maker. ``There is one group that has seen it all and they have the
scars. On the other hand you have this group that says, `Every
breath I take is golden.''' That latter view rankles some valley
pioneers like Andrew Grove, a founder of Intel, and Steve Jobs,
Apple Computer's co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   Grove said that only in the recent past had he begun to hear the
phrase ``exit strategy'' _ do we want to be acquired or aim to go
public? _ which is now routinely part of the planning for tiny
start-up ventures that may not yet have sold their first product.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not reality,'' Jobs said. When Apple started, he said,
his role models were William Hewlett and David Packard, who had set
out to build an institution rather than an overnight gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   And ignoring that reality will ultimately bring its own
reckoning, Hoar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one chapter that keeps repeating itself in this
valley, and that's Chapter 11,'' he said.

 &HT;    Lawmakers want fourth 'R' _ 'Respect' _ taught in schools
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ If kids talk like their grandparents did, maybe
they'll act like them.
</P>
<P>
   That's the logic behind Louisiana legislation requiring public
school students to address teachers and other school employees as
``sir'' and ``ma'am.'' That means this fall, students will have a
fourth ``R'' to learn: Respect.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sailed through the Senate and then passed the House
this week on an 81-19 vote. Pending some discussion of minor
amendments and the governor's signature, it will become law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill is intended to encourage courtesy and respect and to
help people learn good habits of civility,'' said state Rep.
Charles Hudson, a Democrat from Opelousas. ``I think it will make
students better behaved. When you practice the Golden Rule, it
becomes a habit.'' But Dennis Boudreaux, a teacher and a parent
from Erath, thinks the law is useless. ``I have kids who never
misbehave and never told me `yes sir' or `no sir,' and I have kids
who are very polite and very bad,'' he said. ``I'd rather have a
law that gives me more power to discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the ``sir'' and ``ma'am'' bill requires only elementary
school students to use the terms of respect. But it will expand to
include middle and high schools.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier versions, the bill was even stricter: It would have
forced students to stand every time a principal entered the room,
and teachers would have addressed students as ``Mr.'' and
``Ms.''Anne Rochell Konigsmark writes for the Atlanta

 &HT;    FROM GHOST-TOWN TO GHOST-CITY, ALBANIANS MISSING FROM WESTERN
KOSOVO
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-KLA; KOSOVO-SERBS.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

<P>
   PEC, Kosovo _ With hundreds of people missing and thousands of
homes destroyed, southwestern Kosovo looks like the scene of a
natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But it was nearly three months of ethnic cleansing that pounded
this region, and in the eye of the storm was the city of Pec, today
eerily still and abandoned by its Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Pec revolves around a central square, a 10-story bank
building, a shopping center and a park. But the only signs of life
there Tuesday, four days after NATO troops began overseeing a Serb
troop withdrawal from Kosovo, were a dozen Serb men lounging on
park benches and the occasional passing NATO vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the first visits from foreign journalists and while
life is slowly being rebuilt in other Kosovo cities, Pec was still
a shell of a city. NATO troops sometimes walk back-to-back to keep
an eye out for snipers. Women on the outskirts furtively seek
information about family members who have been arrested by Serb
police.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic still stand in
the window of a downtown store, but all the stores are closed. Dogs
wander the streets and, outside town, cattle wander through the
broken windows of greenhouses for grazing space.
</P>
<P>
   As the home of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Pec is a central
element to the claim Serbs make for Kosovo. The partriarchate was
the bastion of Serb identity when the Serbs faced rule by the
Ottoman Muslims for nearly 500 years. Currently, thanks largely to
a campaign of Serbian repression that intensified with NATO bombing
of Yugoslavia, that church is the home to some of the city's few
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-aged Serb men sharing park benches and bottle of
brandy in the central square Tuesday say they are sleeping in the
patriarchate because they fear what the ethnic Albanian majority
would do to them. The men's families are already elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This partriarchate is our own and the land is our own,'' said
Serb Mishko Milonovic, 47.
</P>
<P>
   In words that rang somewhat hollow coming in an abandoned public
square, these men said they wanted to live in peace with ethnic
Albanians and that they were just afraid of the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA), which they called a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   They blamed ``extremist elements'' among their fellow Serbs for
the burning of Kosovar Albanian homes and note that some of the
damage on the nearby roads was caused by NATO airstrikes, which had
touched off the intense Serb terror.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, the grim details of Serb atrocities were being
revealed. In Velika Krusa, an abandoned village of red-block homes
that once housed 6,000 ethnic Albanians, KLA troops showed their
NATO counterparts a home with the charred remains of 20 Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites were being unearthed throughout the region, exposing
body parts and personal affects.
</P>
<P>
   But, it was the broad sweep of the devastation in the region,
possibly the hardest hit in the province, that showed the effect of
Serb efforts to remove ethnic Albanians. In most Albanian villages,
it seemed that more than half the homes were burned. Meanwhile, a
new development of cookie-cutter white Serb homes stood untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Albanians have fled either to neighboring Montenegro
or Albania and are still there in refugee camps. But, even for
those who stayed, the misery did not end with the entrance of NATO
troops.
</P>
<P>
   In the city of Djakovica, there was widespread destruction. In
the city's historic Ottoman bazaar section, block after block of
shops were burned and strewn with rubble. There was no merchandise
visible, indicating that looting preceded the arsons. A mineret at
a mosque had its top blown off.
</P>
<P>
   On the main street, residents swarmed foreign reporters to ask
for word of hundreds of relatives they say were arrested by Serbs
and still not released.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs arrested six young men from the home of electrician
Muharem Kumnova, 56. The missing include his son and son-in-law. As
the withdrawal became inevitable last week, they returned to take
his property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking about my car or my furniture. I don't give a
damn about that,'' he said. ``I just worry about my son and my
people.''

LATEST DEALS CONSOLIDATE N.E.'S UTILITY SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The consolidation of New England's power industry accelerated
Tuesday, with announcements that a New York utility is buying
Central Maine Power for $1.2 billion and Northeast Utilities is
merging with Connecticut's largest gas distributor.
</P>
<P>
   The moves raise new questions about how Boston Edison's parent
company can reach its stated goal of adding another 700,000
customers by the end of next year to reach the size it thinks it
needs to stay efficient and independent.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Tuesday's deals and several other pending utility
mergers are approved by regulators, Edison's parent, BEC Energy, is
looking at a very short list of New England utilities smaller than
itself to buy or merge with _ and it might increasingly look like a
prime takeover candidate, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view these announcements as anything close to the end
of the transaction chain,'' said John Reed, president of the Reed
Consulting Group, who has advised Edison and several other
utilities on power plant sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that is left is a target,'' said industry analyst
Ethan L. Cohen of the Yankee Group, and Edison itself increasingly
looks like ``an ideal acquisition target.''
</P>
<P>
   In the larger of Tuesday's deals, Energy East Corp., which has 1
million gas and electric customers in upstate New York, said it
will buy Central Maine for $957 million in cash, plus another $271
million in assumed debt and preferred stock.
</P>
<P>
   The $29.50 offered for each CMP share outstanding is a 43
percent premium over CMP's Monday closing price. Energy East's
moves follows its April merger with Connecticut Energy Corp., which
has 160,000 gas customers.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Northeast Utilities, which has 2.3 million electric
customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, said it
will merge with Yankee Energy System Inc. in a deal worth $679
million. Yankee, spun off from NU in 1989, has 183,000 customers in
68 cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee shareholders will get $45 a share, paid 45 percent in NU
stock and 55 percent in cash, with individual shareholders able to
ask for more or less cash or stock subject to proration.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Tuesday, Central Maine stock soared 5 11/16 to close
at 25 3/4, and Yankee stock jumped 7 7/16 to 39 15/16. Energy East
rose 1/16 to 26 5/16. Northeast slipped 1/16 to 17 1/4, and BEC was
up 1/2 to 42 7/8. All five trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The moves fuel what has been a frenzied rush among utilities to
combine into ever-larger units as state-level deregulation pushes
them to sell off power plants and grow into larger distribution
companies.
</P>
<P>
   BEC Energy chairman Thomas J. May has set a goal of growing to 2
million customers by the end of next year. May has said that in the
new world of power distribution, ``bigger is better'' to achieve
BEC's goal of becoming a premier New England ``wires and pipes''
company also involved in telecommunications through a venture with
RCN Corp. Edison had no comment on Tuesday's deals.
</P>
<P>
   Edison shareholders later this month are expected to consummate
a $4 billion-plus merger with Commonwealth Energy System, which has
600,000 gas and electric customers in Cambridge, New Bedford, Cape
Cod and elsewhere. That would bring the combined company to 1.3
million customers and get Edison into gas distribution for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   One senior advisor to a Massachusetts generating company said
the Central Maine and Yankee deals complicate May's plans to grow
his firm to the 2 million customer mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to eat or be eaten, and arguably he has to go outside
the region to do acquisitions or he gets eaten here,'' said the
advisor, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's moves further shrink the list of companies smaller
than the Edison-ComEnergy combination that might be acquisition or
merger candidates, including United Illuminating in Connecticut,
Fitchburg Gas and Electric, and Bangor Hydro-Electric in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   One plausible partner might be Eastern Enterprises, parent of
Boston Gas, which last fall announced deals to buy Colonial Gas and
Essex Gas for $600 million to grow to 725,000 customers. Such a
combination, though, could raise antitrust concerns among
Massachusetts regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, Edison would fit well with New England Electric
System, which has 1.3 million customers in Central Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. New England Electric is in the
process of taking over the parent company of Eastern Edison and
Nantucket and Rhode Island utilities and in turn becoming a
subsidiary of British energy giant National Grid Group plc.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculate that the rush to consolidate could soon
include takeovers of some municipal electric departments in
Massachusetts. Vermont utilities, such as Central Vermont Power and
Green Mountain Power, are seen as less attractive takeover
candidates because of delays in the state working out industry
restructuring and deregulation issues.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who advised Edison on its sale of the Pilgrim nuclear
plant and units in Everett, Mass. and South Boston, said, ``BEC is
going to be looking at every other property in the region, and I'm
sure others are looking at them.''

   Getting started on eBay is frighteningly simple.
</P>
<P>
   Type www.ebay.com to get the site. If you want to window-shop,
simply type your particular interest in the Search bar and press
Enter.
</P>
<P>
   For a full explanation of the site, go to the New User section
and click. If you want to bid, you'll have to go to the Register
area, also on the home page.
</P>
<P>
   To register, you must be at least 18 years old. The form will
ask for your e-mail address, your name and street address. A
primary phone number is also required. No credit card information
is required.
</P>
<P>
   If you wish, you can supply such information as your sex, age,
education and income level.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours, eBay will e-mail you a confirmation code, and
you're ready to bid dot com.

   Safety first
</P>
<P>
   A 13-year-old New Jersey boy had his Internet privileges yanked
after he racked up almost $3 million in eBay bids on a red 1955
Ford convertible, a van Gogh painting, an antique bed, a copy of a
Viking ship and a Superman comic book.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a stern ``You must be 18 years old'' reminder (in red)
on the top of the auction site's registration form, he went ahead
and registered. And bid, and bid, and bid.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Pursglove, eBay spokesman, said the company has a strict
policy against bidding by anyone younger than 18. But he said eBay
mostly works on the honor system; it's up to users to report
deadbeat bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The number of consumers complaining that they were defrauded
online went from 1,280 in 1997 to 7,752 in 1998, according to
Internet Fraud Watch, an online fraud reporting system created by
the National Consumers League.
</P>
<P>
   But as e-commerce mushrooms, the Internet companies are coming
up with options to protect the mostly honest shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   On eBay, there's payback if buyer or seller is less than honest
or prompt. The ``Feedback'' forum allows buyers and sellers to
leave messages about their transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company offers i-Escrow, a service that acts as
the third-party agent in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. The buyer and seller agree on a price. The
buyer sends credit-card information (MasterCard, Visa, American
Express, Discover, Diners or Carte Blanche) or a check or money
order, to i-Escrow. Meanwhile the seller sends the item to the
buyers. When the buyer lets i-Escrow know the item has arrived and
is as advertised, i-Escrow forwards the money to the seller.
</P>
<P>
   This service costs the buyer 5 percent of the purchase price
(with a $5 minimum) for objects up to $5,000. Items priced at more
than $5,000 get a discount rate.

RAYTHEON TEAM WINS $1.3 BILLION BRITISH RADAR CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team led by Raytheon Co. received a $1.3 billion order to
build a British military radar system, a boost for the Lexington
defense contractor as it consolidates recent acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the 10-year agreement announced by the United
Kingdom Ministry of Defense Tuesday, the Raytheon team will build
and maintain a system known as the Airborne Standoff Radar, or
ASTOR, for joint use by the country's army and air forces starting
in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon beat out teams led by Lockheed Martin Corp. and
Northrop Grumman Corp. Peter McKee, managing director of Raytheon's
London-based subsidiary, said it expects to add about 2,500 jobs
connected to the program, mainly in Northern Ireland, Scotland, and
Wales where trade union members lobbied heavily for the work.
</P>
<P>
   ASTOR uses sensors carried as high as 50,000 feet on modified
commercial jets, providing military officers with images of ground
activities over hundreds of kilometers. ASTOR is built around radar
technologies Raytheon acquired from General Motors' Hughes Aircraft
unit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Raytheon to win the award after
unconfirmed reports appeared in British newspapers. Still, the
company's widely traded class B shares rose 2 1/16 to close at 74
1/16 in New York Stock exchange trading after Tuesday's formal
announcement. Class A shares added 1 13/16 to 72 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good win for them, and certainly it could be the
predecessor of other similar programs,'' said analyst Paul Nisbet
of JSA Research Inc. in Rhode Island. Said William Fiala, analyst
at the Edward Jones brokerage in St. Louis, ``You need these kinds
of awards to justify the high price they paid for Hughes, and it
gives them some encouragement the integration is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said the order could help Raytheon win an order
for a similar system expected to be made by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization in coming years. The NATO order, it is
estimated, might be worth around $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The US military deploys similar radar systems aboard U-2 spy
planes and on rebuilt 707s known as the Joint Surveillance and
Target System, or JSTARS. But US versions are less integrated.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, the biggest assigned to date by Britain's Labor
government, will team Raytheon with General Electric Co., Motorola
Inc. and Marshall SV, in addition to Montreal-based Bombardier.
Raytheon competes with Bombardier to sell business jets but doesn't
make versions as large; Bombardier will supply five of the jets,
costing about $30 million apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon employs about 2,300 in the United Kingdom. The company
said it could add as many as 4,000 new jobs from potential sales to
other NATO countries.

DIRECTOR VIEWS COMPUTER RIVALRY AS CLASSIC STRUGGLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By DAVID BLOOM 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pizza boxes and caffeine, bad hygiene, ill-fitting
suits and screaming fits, all bathed in the soft cathode-ray glow
of computer screens hardly seems the stuff of a classic yarn.
</P>
<P>
   Except to Martyn Burke, who thinks a certain much-celebrated
bard might have written about Apple Computers' Steve Jobs and
Microsoft's Bill Gates, had the rise of the personal computer
happened when Elizabeth I, not Elizabeth II, was queen of England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Shakespearean nature of the story of these two men,''
said Burke, who wrote and directed TNT's ``Pirates of Silicon
Valley'' about the two ubergeeks of the computing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's `Hamlet,' `Macbeth' and `Richard III' combined,'' Burke
said. ``There's a scene in `Richard III' where his enemies have
laid siege to all around, and he says, `My kingdom for a horse.'
That's what I thought of when I read about Steve Jobs' 30th
birthday party. Jobs is basically Richard III to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Burke is too much the veteran of Hollywood features
and documentaries to try to sell the story to development execs
without a more modern conflation of reference points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a story that transcends all the boundaries,'' Burke
said. ``In that kind of Hollywood shorthand, it was `Diner' meets
`Citizen Kane.' There was more drama in this than I've seen in a
lot of other stuff. That was what attracted me.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the movie traces the somewhat similar upward trajectory
of Jobs and Gates from the early 1970s through the mid-1980s, Burke
said the two are substantially different kinds of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no particular ax to grind when I came to this story,''
Burke said. ``I let the story write itself on the basis of
research. Gates emerged as a guy who's completely different from
Jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The research is partly based on the Paul Freiberger book, ``Fire
in the Valley,'' as well as much other material compiled by Burke
and the film's actors, particularly Noah Wyle, who became
passionate about the role after Burke sent him a documentary cued
to Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched 10 seconds and knew I'd kick myself for the rest of
my life if I didn't play the part,'' said Wyle, who worked
seven-day weeks to finish both the film and his starring role on
``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Michael Hall, the long-lost Brat Packer who played
Gates, called his part ``the role of a lifetime. Gates is like the
Henry Ford or John Rockefeller of our generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The portraits that emerge are of extraordinarily intense people
who through luck, brains, insane work habits, smart friends and
stupid competitors changed American business.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs is a charismatic seeker trying to fill some existential
hole in himself and driving those around him mercilessly, exhorting
them to be ``insanely great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jobs) has these furies he's coping with all the time,'' Burke
said. ``He was always at a remove from everyone around him. Gates
did not personalize his furies the way Jobs would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke shows Jobs _ an adopted child who hires a private
detective to find his natural mother _ trying LSD and many Eastern
religions and alternative spiritual practices.
</P>
<P>
   Later, still driven but bolstered by fabulous success, his
almost classically Greek hubris nearly undid him _ and his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he got more power and became more of a guru in his own
right, whatever the brakes were on his behavior fell away,'' Burke
said. ``He went crazy on his employees all the time. The thing that
created the success of Apple was also the source of its problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In one particularly painful scene, the movie shows Jobs verbally
savaging a job applicant who wears the virtual uniform of IBM:
pressed white button-down Oxford shirt, conservative tie, slacks
and close-cropped hair. The man doesn't belong and will never fit
in, Jobs says.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, on the other hand, comes across as the consummate poker
player, literally and figuratively. Anthony Michael Hall, like Wyle
a ringer for his subject, plays Gates as a Machiavellian snake who
uses whatever advantage he can to win a card game _ or a business
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he's far goofier than Jobs, having ``dates''
with venture capitalist/longtime buddy Anna Winblad where they
simultaneously would attend a movie and then, because they happened
to be in different cities, talk about it on the phone afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates comes off as classic nerd, but how many nerds do
you know who steal bulldozers in the middle of the night, as he did
in Albuquerque?'' Burke said. For that matter, how many geeks
commandeer their buddy's new car, go speeding through the night and
wind up in jail?
</P>
<P>
   But it's Gates' high-stakes poker mind that is most distinctive
in the film, as Gates tells his college buddies (and Microsoft
colleagues) Paul Allen and Steve Ballmer that the key to successful
negotiating is getting a person to believe they want what you have,
and only you can provide it to them.
</P>
<P>
   We see him squeeze his first computer maker to double the
nascent Microsoft's royalty payments for the operating system he
and Allen had hurriedly written in their Harvard dorm room. Without
the operating system, he tells the hardware maker, his
``brilliant'' machine is just a bunch of blinking lights in a box.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of argument worked on the big boys, too, as IBM agreed
to buy an operating system for the IBM PC that Gates and Allen
hadn't yet created. The result, MS-DOS, became the dominant system
for running personal computers, thanks to IBM's still-magic name in
the business world.
</P>
<P>
   And ultimately, Gates talked Jobs into giving him three
prototypes of Apple's crown jewel, the paradigm-shifting Macintosh.
The result was Microsoft's Windows, a new operating system that
made ugly old PCs run like a Mac without needing to be one.
</P>
<P>
   Though it took several tries (and a successful fending off of
Apple's ``look and feel'' technology infringement lawsuit),
Windows' latest versions run more computers than any operating
system in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Windows came out, that's what absolutely floored Jobs,''
Burke said. ``The one person he had trusted came back to haunt him.
Jobs had this kind of Achilles heel. He had this one area of
weakness and was looking for something. Gates, for some reason,
understood Steve Jobs better than anybody, consciously or
unconsciously.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly $50 billion later, Gates is the world's richest man,
while Jobs first had to humiliate himself on stage before Apple
faithfuls, declaring in 1997 that the age of competition with
Microsoft was over, then trying to save the lurching company he'd
left a dozen years earlier from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Burke doesn't admire his subjects in many ways, for all
the warts his movie shows on their public portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, after a massive underestimation of the Internet's impact,
has spent billions positioning his company to dominate that area,
too. And Jobs has not only returned Apple to profitability and
hipness as its interim CEO but also owns computer animation studio
Pixar, which produced Disney's ``A Bug's Life'' and ``Toy Story''
to huge acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's one of the more amazing characters in American
public life,'' Burke said of Jobs. ``He proves that (F. Scott)
Fitzgerald was wrong when he said there were no second acts in
American lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman John Pinette said the movie's makers took
some substantial liberties with the historical record in making
``Pirates,'' but that the company would let viewers make their own
decision about what to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reaction is this is a made-for-TV movie, and that says
enough,'' Pinette said. ``In the end, it's a movie about the
graphical user interface, and you have to take some liberties to
make that interesting. We're basically going to let other people
decide its merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple did not return calls seeking comment on the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Burke has one final metaphor for what Gates and Jobs wrought:
Vietnam, and the American combat involvement there that was ending
just as the personal computer revolution was starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the old days of the student radicals who were
determined to overthrow the power structure, they failed,'' Burke
said. ``And these guys, who were ignored by everybody, succeeded.
The techies, the nerds, basically undermined the way business was
done in America.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more engaging parts of ``Pirates of Silicon Valley''
is the series of culture clashes between execs of major technology
corporations such as IBM, Xerox and Hewlett-Packard in the early
days of Apple and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Where those companies (much like the American military of that
day) were heavily bureaucratic, top-down and unable to envision any
personal use for the computer, the then-tiny Microsoft and Apple
were agile and forward-thinking enough to outstrip the big
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't care about structure and hierarchy,'' Burke said.
``It was almost a metaphor of what was going on in Vietnam.
American business is kind of small-scale guerrilla warfare all the
time. HP (Hewlett-Packard) and Xerox and IBM were actually missing
the boat.''

WEB SITES LOOK TO BAY STATE FIRM FOR MORE SPEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Massachusetts firm has signed deals to soup up the performance
of 20 major World Wide Web sites, including Time Warner Inc.'s
Cable News Network and the Walt Disney Co.'s Go Network.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai Technologies Inc., of Cambridge, uses software developed
by MIT mathematician Frank Leighton, as well as a worldwide network
of server computers, to speed up the distribution of pictures,
advertisements, audio, and video clips over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delivering their content faster and more reliably over
the Internet than they were able to do before,'' said Akamai chief
executive George Conrades, former chief of Internet pioneer BBN
Corp. of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Monty Mullig, vice president of CNN Internet Technologies, says
his firm hopes to gain a 20 percent improvement in site performance
by using the Akamai system, known as FreeFlow. ``It's cheaper and
faster than the way we currently serve up images,'' Mullig said.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms that announced deals with Akamai include The New
York Times Web site, the Motley Fool financial information service,
the SportsLine USA sports site, and Internet portals Infoseek,
About.com, and Looksmart. Akamai earlier this month announced a
similar deal with Yahoo Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai charges companies by the amount of data transmitted
through the FreeFlow network. The company would not give revenue
projections, but said each client would be paying thousands of
dollars per month for the service.
</P>
<P>
   The Akamai system is a variation on the idea of Internet
caching, a system in which information from a Web site is copied
onto a network of servers scattered throughout the Internet. When
somebody requests information from the Web site, that request is
routed to the nearest cache server, rather than the Web site
itself. As a result, the user gets a faster response.
</P>
<P>
   But caching is difficult when the information stored at the main
Web site changes frequently. A site such as CNN may put up new
pictures several times an hour, so that the cached versions of the
site quickly become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai claims to have solved this problem. The company operates
about 600 servers, connected to 20 major Internet service
providers. These servers can transmit a total of 11 billion bits of
data per second. In addition, Akamai's MIT-developed software
attaches a digital fingerprint to the cached information. In this
way, each server can constantly check to make sure it has the most
current version of all the data.
</P>
<P>
   Conrades said the Akamai service will enable major Web sites to
``richen up'' their content by adding more pictures, video, and
sound files to Web pages. Web sites currently keep such materials
to a minimum because they slow down site performance, but Conrades
said Akamai will reduce this problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is very cool, no doubt about that,'' said
Peter Christy, principal analyst for Collaborative Research, a
network research firm in Los Altos, Calif. Christy said privately
held Akamai has good prospects, because Web-site operators are
scrambling to meet their users' demands for richer content and
faster performance.

LINES ARE DRAWN IN MEDICARE DRUG PRICING BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Maine, Fla., Texas, Va., Ore., La.)  (nk) 
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., talks about elderly
Minnesotans forced to travel across the border to Canada to buy
affordable prescription drugs. Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, talks about
an elderly woman who stopped taking her medications because her
husband was sicker than she was, and they could not afford
prescriptions for two.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leaders sent their members home for the last
recess with an informational packet organized around a simple
message: ``Prescription Drug Prices Are Out of Control.'' White
House officials are racing to finish their Medicare restructuring
proposal, which includes a major new drug benefit for older
Americans. And the pharmaceutical industry, dismayed at the
possibility of becoming a prime whipping boy for the 2000
elections, is warning of dire consequences in research and
innovation if government bureaucrats get involved in drug pricing.
</P>
<P>
   In short, what may be one of the last great health care
struggles of the Clinton administration has begun on Capitol Hill.
And the politics around it are so ferocious, so inextricably linked
to the battle over control of the House and the White House, and so
reminiscent of health care battles past, that no one is quite sure
whether the result will be a policy or a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that what the Democrats really want is the
latter. ``They've already printed the bumper stickers on this,''
said Rep. Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee. ``What we want to do is get the
problem fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the House Democratic
Caucus, countered, ``They may want to spin this as a diabolical
plot, but that's just not correct. This is an issue that seniors
care deeply about, and we have something to say about it and the
Republicans have nothing to say about it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little debate over the substance of the drug issue:
that more than a third of Medicare beneficiaries lack coverage for
outpatient prescription drugs, that their numbers will probably
grow as private sources of coverage get more expensive and harder
to keep, and that this coverage gap becomes more of a hardship as
drugs grow more expensive and more important in treating the ills
of old age.
</P>
<P>
   But as is so often the case in health care policy, consensus
breaks down on how to solve the problem _ particularly over how to
pay for it within a system that already faces difficulties in
paying for existing benefits over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   While there were efforts in the past to address this need _ a
new drug benefit was part of the Clinton health care plan of
1993-94 _ many Democrats say they have been stunned at the power of
the issue in recent months. Unlike so much of Medicare policy,
which revolves around complicated discussions of reimbursement
rates and managed competition, prescription drug coverage is ``a
very digestible concept,'' as one White House adviser put it.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats have done their part to stoke interest in it. Over
the last year, Democratic staff members on the House Government
Reform Committee have conducted surveys in 55 congressional
districts, comparing the prices for drugs paid by favored customers
like the Veterans Administration, which the committee staff asserts
is close to what big health maintenance organizations pay, with the
prices paid by the elderly without drug coverage, who are buying
retail.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats assert that these studies show rampant ``price
discrimination'' against the elderly, that millions of older
Americans not only have to pay for their own prescriptions but are
also charged top dollar, compared with the industry's ``preferred''
buyers, who negotiate better prices. The pharmaceutical industry
contends these studies have serious methodological flaws. But in
district after district, Democratic lawmakers have announced their
findings to local newspaper headlines like ``Gouging Granny'' and
``Study: The Elderly Get Taken on Drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely amazed,'' said Rep. Karen Thurman, D-Fla.,
who announced results of a study in her district earlier this
month. ``I'd be at the Wal-Mart or whatever and people would come
up and say, `Thank you. This has needed to be addressed for so
long.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so potent is the prescription drug issue that it has
suddenly become the tail wagging the dog of a broader Medicare
overhaul, needed to shore up the program for the retirement of the
baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks Medicare is in trouble,'' said Celinda Lake,
a Democratic pollster. ``Everybody opposes almost all the reforms.
And everybody's top idea for reform is prescription drug coverage,
which they acknowledge is an expansion of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say this is not surprising. Robert Blendon,
an expert on public opinion and health at Harvard, said surveys had
shown that over-60 voters, who are the people most likely to vote
on the basis of Medicare issues, are decidedly ``risk averse.'' As
a result, they are likely to be leery of the kind of sweeping,
market-oriented restructuring that was proposed by Sen. John
Breaux, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is some nervousness among Democrats about
Clinton's decision to produce a detailed Medicare plan, which is
expected to be unveiled later this month, after he returns from
Europe. He pushed ahead with a proposal after assailing the plan
produced by Breaux, who headed a bipartisan Medicare commission
that ended in a deadlock over whether to approve a final report.
</P>
<P>
   Aides and allies say it is very much in keeping with this
president to want to produce an alternative of his own.
</P>
<P>
   But as Democrats learned to their horror in 1993-94, the details
of health care proposals can be deadly. In fact, even the details
of a popular drug benefit can be problematic. For example, health
care veterans say, how much will the premium be? Administration
aides say one obvious goal is keeping it below the $70 to $90 a
month a drug benefit would cost in a Medigap policy, while making
the benefit more generous. Since the benefit is expected to be
optional, it needs to be an attractive deal, analysts say.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   How high will the deductible be or will there even be one? Both
Congress and the White House remember the political disaster of the
quickly repealed, 1988 law on catastrophic health care, which would
have provided prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries
but with high deductibles that some older Americans felt they would
never meet.
</P>
<P>
   How high will the co-payment be? Which drugs will be covered?
And, of course, how exactly will the benefit be financed?
</P>
<P>
   Bill McInturff, the Republican pollster who worked for the
health insurance industry in the 1993-94 struggle, and has also
polled for the pharmaceuticals industry, argues that three iron
laws of health care politics apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unacceptable options are that you cannot ask people to
reduce their own quality of care so more people have care; you
cannot displace them from private coverage to enter a government
program; and you cannot ask them to voluntarily go into a
government program if it's less generous than the private coverage
they already have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This struggle, in short, is filled with political pitfalls.
Moreover, the pharmaceutical industry is widely considered to be
one of the most powerful and effective lobbyists around.
</P>
<P>
   They came under fire in the 1993-94 health care struggle, when
both the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton assailed them for
their prices _ and more importantly, proposed a variety of measures
in their ill-fated health plan to hold those prices down. Since
then, the industry has engaged in a significant advertising
campaign to burnish their image, and it has produced results, many
analysts say.

   One recent television commercial, for example, featured a drug
company researcher talking about the ``heartbreaking'' damage
children suffer from ear infections, using his son as an example.
``My pharmaceutical company has been working on a new vaccine that
will prevent ear infections in children,'' the researcher says.
``It would be really nice if children didn't have to go through
what my son went through.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Alixe Glen Mattingly, senior vice president for public affairs
at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,
declared this week, ``The pharmaceutical industry is very committed
to policies and laws that will ensure not only seniors but
everyone's access to affordable medicines. But a big government
solution will inevitably lead to price controls which will
inevitably lead to a decrease in industry's research into
tomorrow's cures.''
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical organization issued a statement earlier this
year embracing the concept of expanding prescription drug coverage
for Medicare beneficiaries _ provided it comes through private
health plans that ``rely on market competition, not government
regulation or price controls, to improve quality, integrate care
and manage costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has withheld judgment on the final version of Clinton
plan, but is raising alarms about several bills that have already
been introduced, either creating a new drug benefit for Medicare or
trying to regulate prices for its beneficiaries. Among the latter
is Allen's bill, ``The Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors
Act,'' which would allow pharmacists to purchase prescription drugs
for older Americans at the same low prices available to favored
customers, like HMO's.
</P>
<P>
   Industry spokesmen assert the Allen bill would place 40 percent
of the market under price controls and thus ``discourage investment
in developing tomorrow's cures.''
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., presented a
proposal Tuesday that would use an increase in the tobacco tax to
subsidize prescription drug benefits for older Americans, depending
on their incomes. Medicare beneficiaries would be able to choose
from a variety of competing, private plans, monitored by a federal
board.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical research group described
that plan as ``a helpful contribution'' because it was
``market-based,'' but stopped short of an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of government intervention in a private health care
marketplace was a powerful factor in the defeat of the Clintons'
health care plan five years ago, when the insurance industry ran
the commercials starring ``Harry and Louise,'' a couple fretting
over the government restructuring their health care.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America planned a public opinion campaign to counter the current
legislative efforts, Ms. Mattingly replied, ``No decisions have
been made, but we are considering increasing our communication to
the general public about the stark crossroads that Congress is at,
on this issue of a drug benefit.''

MEDICAL GROUP ALLEGES SERB ABUSES IN KOSOVO CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Serbian forces engaged in a systematic campaign of
violence and destruction in their drive to expel Kosovar Albanians
from the province, Physicians for Human Rights said in a report
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston group said interviews with 1,180 refugees showed that
one in every three households reported some sort of human rights
abuse, including killing, beatings, torture, and shootings. The
survey also contradicts claims by the Yugoslav government that
refugees fled because of NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is said to be the first comprehensive population
study of Kosovar Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of violence against the Kosovar Albanians was really
quite extraordinary,'' said Leonard Rubenstein, the executive
director of Physicians for Human Rights. ``This helps us understand
more what the Serb campaign has been about. It wasn't simply to get
people out of Kosovo. It was a campaign of destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is based entirely on interviews with randomly sampled
refugees in camps in Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week's agreement between NATO and Belgrade, no
independent observers had been allowed in Kosovo in recent weeks.
The sample cannot be generalized to apply to all Kosovar Albanian
refugees as it did not involve those who left the camps for
resettlement elsewhere or refugees who arrived in camps after May
3.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians for Human Rights was one of the first rights groups
to call for ground troops to allow for the repatriation of Kosovar
Albanians. The group has also demanded the indictment of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosovic for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The 148-page report was designed to assess the extent and
pervasiveness of abuse suffered by the refugee population from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents reported human rights abuses in 23 of the 29
districts in the Connecticut-size province, with the greatest
number of abuses in densely populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows how systematic and widespread these abuses are,''
said Dr. Vincent Iacopino, who supervised the project.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also suggested that the experiences of Kosovo
Albanian refugees were sharply different from those of Tutsis in
Rwanda who were subjected to a massive genocidal campaign of rape
and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents reported a total of 59 killings out of 11,458
household members. The report documented only 44 cases of torture
and four cases of sexual assault by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Iacopino said that while the numbers might seem low, they
reflected the brief exposure refugees had to Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are serious abuses that happened in a very short period
of time,'' said Iacopino. ``It represents an example of the speed
and brutality with which Kosovar refugees were displaced and
abused.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of the refugees reported that their chief
reason for leaving Kosovo was direct or indirect expulsion by
Serbian forces. None stated they had left their homes because of
NATO bombing. The majority of the abuses were committed in March
and April of 1999, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found:
</P>
<P>
   --The homes of nearly a third of respondents were burned by Serb
forces.
</P>
<P>
   --Twenty-three percent of respondents witnessed the destruction
of medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
   --Serb soldiers demanded money from half of all respondents.
</P>
<P>
   The Physicians for Human Rights survey was conducted in
conjunction with the Program on Forced Migration and Health, and
the Center for Population and Family Health of the Joseph L.
Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.

<P>
   BIR-LAHLOU, Western Sahara _ The sun beats down ever more
harshly as summer approaches, raising noontime temperatures above
130 degrees. The desert is silent, the only movement tumbleweed
blown by oven-hot gusts.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a cluster of mud-hut billets, fighters grown wizened
through long years of war, and now by an endless truce, drift down
a cycle of empty days. Weapons are dismantled, cleaned and cleaned
again. Sand is swept from doorways and floors, then swept some
more. Mangy dogs scrounge for scraps, then slope outside to bark in
the blinding sun.
</P>
<P>
   Bir-Lahlou _ ``a place of sweet water'' in Arabic _ lies deep
inland from the Atlantic rim of North Africa, in a region where the
Sahara's coastal dunes turn to flat, rocky, inhospitable terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Once an oasis for camel trains, the whitewashed billets are now
an outpost of the Polisario Front, a guerrilla force that has spent
most of the last decade idled in the desert, waiting out a
cease-fire that ended 16 years of war with Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed territory, with a population of perhaps 300,000,
including 180,000 who live as refugees in Algeria, has drawn notice
mainly as the last of dozens of former European colonies in Africa
still classified by the United Nations as awaiting
``decolonization.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparations are under way for a long-postponed referendum in
March. But with competing claims of heritage so entrenched, U.N.
officials are skeptical about its chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may seem like the end of the earth to you, but it is not
for us,'' said Ibrahim Salam Bouseif, 42, a Polisario official who
was born in a desert tent and became the first in his nomad family
to go to school. ``The desert for us is home. In the desert we are
free; there are no restrictions. We can see forever. We can cast
our eyes to the horizon, and all we see is sand and sky. In the
desert our spirits can fly.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' cause dates from 1975, when Spain, after 130 years
of colonial rule, abandoned Western Sahara to Morocco and
Mauritania, countries that flank the territory to the north and
south. Mauritania withdrew in 1978, but Morocco's forces and
Polisario, which seeks independence, fought on until a cease-fire
in 1991 that left Morocco in control of all but a distant
hinterland bordering Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Polisario leaders agreed with King Hassan II of Morocco
to settle the dispute with a referendum among the territory's
original inhabitants, the Saharawis, a people of Arab and Berber
descent who lived as nomads for a thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   The choice is between independence and integration into Morocco.
But a dispute over who should vote _ in effect, over over who is
and who is not a Saharawi _ has caused repeated postponements.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Morocco and the Polisario agreed to the March
deadline and to a renewed, six-month U.N. effort to complete the
list of voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Morocco's insistence that thousands of Moroccan loyalists be
added to a provisional U.N. roll of 83,000 people _ and Morocco's
threat to block the referendum again if the additional voters are
excluded _ could prolong the impasse well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which backed Morocco under Cold War policies
aimed at pushing back Marxist influences in Africa, has been active
since the Soviet Union's collapse in seeking a settlement as part
of a wider push for regional stability.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker has served since 1997
as special envoy on the territory for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, but U.S. diplomats familiar with Baker's views say he has
concluded privately that the world organization should consider a
new approach.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's solution, secretly broached with Morocco and the
Polisario last year, could involve Morocco's retaining sovereignty
for 25 or 30 years in return for Saharawi autonomy and a pledge to
reopen the sovereignty issue later, say diplomats familiar with the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar has been hinted at by Algeria, where the newly
elected President, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was born in Morocco,
has advocated a Western Sahara settlement in which, in his words,
there would be ``neither winner nor loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Polisario fighters took up arms against the Spanish
occupiers as teen-age boys in the early 1970s. Others, like Omar
Sid Ahmed Omar, 58, the garrison commander at Bir-Lahlou, were
soldiers in Spain's colonial army before defecting to the rebels.
With his wife, children and several grandchildren living in the
refugee camps in Algeria, a half-day's drive east of Bir-Lahlou, he
longs for the war to end.
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither the commander nor any of his men at Bir-Lahlou seem
ready to accept any deal with Morocco that falls short of Western
Sahara's independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I do not wish to grow old here sitting in the sun,'' Omar
said, over a tin of U.N.-supplied tuna shared with visitors. ``But
compromise with Morocco? Never! We will never accept the rule of
King Hassan! We will die in the desert rather than live under the
Moroccan flag.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Morocco, attitudes seem equally hard set. The issue has
become inseparably linked with King Hassan, who made the annexation
a touchstone of his reign in the 1970s and poured huge sums _ at
least $20 billion by Moroccan officials' accounting _ into the war
and into showcase development projects that have turned Aiun, the
territorial capital, into a modern town from the shabby backwater
bequeathed by Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Since King Hassan led a march of 350,000 Moroccans into the
Western Sahara in 1975, few Moroccans have disputed his contention
that the territory, which represents more than a third of Morocco's
land area, was part of precolonial Morocco, reaching back more than
a thousand years to a time when Moorish dynasties ruled all of the
territory from Spain to Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
   The truce left a Morocco in control of a region about twice the
size of England, with a 750-mile Atlantic coastline teeming with
fish and a hinterland with rich phosphate deposits but little else
of proven economic worth. Under the cease-fire, a small U.N.
peacekeeping force separates about 80,000 Moroccan troops from
15,000 Polisario fighters and reservists.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, King Hassan has embraced the new referendum deadline
and assigned his most powerful aide, Interior Minister Driss Basri,
to what Basri calls a ``permanent election campaign.'' At carefully
scripted public meetings, Basri has urged Moroccan loyalists to
present themselves to U.N. scrutiny as potential voters.
</P>
<P>
   He has also warned that the new voting deadline is the last that
Morocco will accept. ``In March 2000, the referendum will settle
the issue in Morocco's favor once and for all,'' he told a
gathering in Smara, a town deep in the desert interior. ``And if
the United Nations cannot hold to the date, so be it _ the Sahara
will remain Moroccan, now and forever.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials familiar with the voter enumerations say
privately that they expect few of the 65,000 nominees Morocco wants
added to the provisional voters list to qualify under the tight
rules accepted by the two sides in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the rules limit eligibility to residents of the
territory included in a 1974 Spanish census, their direct
descendants and a narrow range of others, including those missed by
the Spanish count. Morocco is insisting that the vote be extended
to thousands of people living elsewhere in Morocco who can
demonstrate Saharawi tribal links.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials familiar with the list of 83,000 voters already
registered say a referendum based on that list would be likely to
produce at least a narrow majority for the Polisario, which could
rely on strong support from voters in refugee camps in Algeria and
Mauritania, as well as among disaffected Saharawis in the
Moroccan-occupied parts of Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   If most of the new voters put forward by Morocco are rejected,
Morocco's likeliest move would be to pull out of the process again.
Basri has already signaled that Morocco will not proceed with any
referendum it is not certain of winning.
</P>
<P>
   As his plane flew over the Atlas Mountains on a recent trip to
Aiun, the interior minister said nobody should think Morocco could
countenance a referendum defeat. ``Anybody who was prepared to
consider the loss of the territory would be considered a traitor,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polisario leaders have said they believe that no final
settlement can be reached until the death of the 69-year-old king,
who has been in declining health.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moroccan officials say nothing is amiss, Moroccans have
noted King Hassan's pallor on public occasions and the increased
prominence he has given to his heir, Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed.
The crown prince attended the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan in
his father's place earlier this year and later traveled to Paris,
again in his father's place, to attend opening ceremonies for a
Moroccan cultural festival.
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner at a Polisario guest house near Tindouf, Polisario
defense minister Mohammed Lamin Bohali said the 32-year-old crown
prince's succession could be the breakthrough the Polisario has
awaited for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Hassan has been the main source of our problems,'' Bohali
said, ``and the main obstacle to resolving them. From all we hear,
Sidi Mohammed is more flexible and might want to relieve his people
of a burden they never wanted.''

   Stop me before I double-click again.
</P>
<P>
   My eyes are bloodshot, my wrists are sore and my back aches. But
I'm so entranced, I can't stop.
</P>
<P>
   My husband's car breaks down, and he has to walk three miles in
90-degree heat because he can't call home, the line is busy. I'm
making a buy.
</P>
<P>
   It started, like most habits do, with curiosity. One online
purchase certainly wouldn't be a gateway to sin. One hundred
personal checks later proves otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   I'm an eBay junkie _ addicted to an auction house in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Software engineer Pierre Omidyar had only the sweetest
intentions when he started eBay three years ago. He set up a
personal World Wide Web page as a forum for his girlfriend to trade
the Pez dispensers she collected.
</P>
<P>
   Now his simple page has morphed into a 2.25 million-item
inventory covering 1,627 categories with 3.8 million registered
users. The beauty of the system is that the company does not own
the inventory _ it belongs to the sellers who pay eBay a listing
fee and a percentage of the sales price to offer their goods
through the whiz-bang of computer land.
</P>
<P>
   The result is garage-sale heaven. Just a five-minute perusal of
the site clicks up 135 listings of Mexican pottery, 1,563 of
Depression glass, 3,858 dolls, 484 African-American art objects,
and, heaven help us, 8,572 Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in Idaho is offering gently worn cowboy boots, a
Hawaiian seller is selling earrings made in India and a woman in
England is advertising toast forks. And you can see what you buy _
most of the listings include one or more color photographs of the
item, pointing out flaws or details.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't QVC, where you buy a cubic zirconium that you'll see
coming and going at Wal-Mart. No sir, these are genuine,
one-of-a-kind ``objets.''
</P>
<P>
   No more pawing through formula-stained Onesies, Dallas Cowboys
coozies and lidless crockpots to get to the Steuben vase. No more
Saturday mornings of crack-o'-dawn alarms to beat out the other
garage-salers. No more trying to juggle the children, the traffic
and the marked-up classifieds.
</P>
<P>
   And the eBay facilitators make the shopping as pleasant as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The system is set up like any live auction. Items are offered in
categories, shoppers click on entries that catch the eye
``GENUINETURKISH VASEHAND PAINTED'' and look at the description as
well as the photograph.
</P>
<P>
   If you care to bid, look at the last bid, figure what you'd like
to pay, enter the amount and submit the bid. When the auction is
completed (most are scheduled to run five days) the high bidder is
notified by e-mail from eBay. Seller and buyer have three days to
get in touch by e-mail, and the buyer sends off a check or money
order, including the purchase price and usually, postage.
</P>
<P>
   Like a real-deal auction, there is technique to be learned. Most
heavy bidding seems to occur within an hour or two of the item's
close time. Sometimes the seller sets a reserve price, meaning it
won't sell unless a certain price is met.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I blame my addiction _ as many people do _ on the stress of my
job. I was compiling information for a yearlong ``food through the
century'' project. I needed old recipes, old photographs, just
plain old stuff to help me get a handle on the way we've been
eating for the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   After tackling the local libraries and my own collection of
cookbooks, on the advice of a co-worker, I turned to eBay.
</P>
<P>
   My first purchase was Item 887792861: Jell-O Recipe Booklet _
Work of Art!!! 1925 (I was the high bidder at $6). I followed that
with Item 88541687: RECIPES The House of Chan Cookbook 1952 ($3).
Then came Item 88282989: 500 Delicious Salads (recipes) Cookbook
OLD ($2). This, I've gotta say, rocks.
</P>
<P>
   By now I was a regular. I knew my way around the site. (''It's
like crack,'' said one co-worker. ``Walk away and just say no.'')
Now I could peck around for things I used to buy at flea markets
before I had a house payment and a child and a college fund to
build.
</P>
<P>
   First I bought treasures for myself. Item 88911475: Gorgeous
Colors! _ Bakelite (?) Old Jewelry Box ($10.49). Then came Item
90691226: Old Dip Bowl w/ Recipes on Outside Gold Trim ($1.50). I
followed that with Jade/Jadite lamp No Reserve ($29.52).
</P>
<P>
   It got to the point that I was firing up the laptop as soon as I
walked in the house after work. Dinner was left to the boys to
perform. I had tchotchkes to track down. But a little guilt did
start to seep in around the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Item 96695543: SOAP ``MADE IN SPAIN'' (3) SEE PIC!!! ($4.99)
will send my mother-in-law over the moon come Christmas. She loves
Macedonia glycerin soap and hasn't been able to find it since a
trip to Europe 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Item 95919386: WOW 3 MINT HESS TRUCKS 1992/93/94 IN BOXES
($74.95) filled in the holes in my son's green-and-white truck
collection.
</P>
<P>
   But my sacrificial buys didn't help my case _ the phone became
an issue. My son's friends couldn't get through, my husband's
office couldn't reach him, my parents wondered whether Fort Worth
had been hit by another hailstorm.
</P>
<P>
   My husband insisted on a cable modem to free up the phone. Add
$30 a month to the household budget. My 6-year-old knew to tell a
playmate that a word processor ``doesn't get eBay.'' The household
schedule was being affected. Lots of the auctions end around 7-9
p.m. Pacific time _ two hours later here _ time I should be using
to get ready for the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But all will be forgiven. Wait until next week when the mailman
drives up with Item 111100650: Wooly Mammoth Skull with Ivory
Tusks.

RELIGIOUS LEADERS EXPAND THEIR MINISTRIES TO THE INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ From the front bedroom of his Fort Worth
home, Brian Oakes can enter a Christian mission field.
</P>
<P>
   With the flip of a switch on his computer, Oakes can join a
gathering of about 300 Christians from a registration list of
15,000 to discuss everything from Jesus Christ to the latest trends
in Christian music to the politics of a church youth group.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't think this type of ministry is relevant,'' said
Oakes, 23, a self-described computer geek and founder of the
Christian Chat Network. ``But let's look at people's lives. What do
people do? They spend most of their time on the Internet. If the
church is not willing to embrace it, then the church is going to
get left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Though perhaps not a place where people spend ``most of their
time,'' the Internet has affected how many people do business, and
the business of religion is increasingly no exception. More
Christians are going online, changing the ways that spiritual
communities interact and discuss matters of the soul.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders are e-mailing congregation members, preachers are
broadcasting sermons, peddlers are selling their religious wares,
and individuals, such as those gathered by Oakes, are reaching out
to one another for solace and inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is as significant a new medium as the printing
press was, and we know now what the printing press did,'' said Fran
Maier, chancellor of the Catholic Archdiocese of Denver, making
reference to the Protestant Reformation that was propelled by the
printed word. ``We want to be ahead of the curve rather than behind
it the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   As Christians strive to stay ahead of the curve, however, many
religious leaders are concerned that widespread Internet use could
erode the church's calling to bring people together, physically and
spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to say is, `If you use the Internet, you need to
use it as a tool to move people toward embodied relationships,'''
said Robert DeVargas, an assistant professor at Southwestern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, who is creating an
ethics and technology course on the Internet and ministry. ``That
means first in a relationship to God, to the church, and in a
relationship with friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there appears little danger that disembodied multitudes
will forsake the pews for their computers, according to a 10-month
survey of religion online conducted for a division of the United
Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a lack of people saying, `Oh good, I don't
have to get up and get dressed and go to church. I can log onto the
Internet and go to church,' '' said the study's author, Ken Bedell,
vice president of the Forum Foundation in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Internet users, those using the technology for
religious matters log on to improve communications and find
information, according to the study, which was completed last year.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the movement toward the Internet is part of a
progression starting with radio and television that has led
religion away from the pulpit or the camp meeting ground and into
the home. But the difference now is that the Internet also allows
for more individual autonomy and privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not unique to the Internet but, because of the
interactive nature, it is more compelling to be disembodied,''
DeVargas said.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that it allows users the chance to attend an
online Bible discussion or hear a sermon that a child's soccer
practice or other commitments might have pre-empted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sit down at your computer once the kids are in bed and
everyone is settled down ... and listen to it while you are paying
your bills,'' said Paula Golway, marketing manager for the
Dallas-based Lightsource.com, which provides Christian programming
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Lightsource.com, run by an advertising agency that specializes
in Christian ministries, funnels popular Christian radio programs
such as Focus on the Family onto the Internet and broadcasts
services from churches such as Preston Hollow Presbyterian Church
in Dallas onto the personal computer, making it available for
consumption at the user's discretion.
</P>
<P>
   The number of possible people accessing the programming has also
expanded. Since January 1997, Lightsource.com has had an exclusive
contract to provide Christian programming for Broadcast.com, which
was recently bought by Yahoo!. And that will provide an
evangelizing link to one of the busiest sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when Christ walked the Earth, he did it via himself and
12 disciples,'' Golway said. ``Now we have a way of expanding it
around the world in milliseconds. It's a very interesting and very
hip way of doing what people have been doing for 2000 years.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, the possibility that the technology will not
only enhance but alter what people have been doing for 2000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Archdiocese of Denver sponsored a four-day
seminar examining how emerging technologies will affect the ways
faith is communicated in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   It included computer industry professionals, theologians and
church leaders who looked at how to use technologies such as the
Internet to ``make disciples of all nations.'' But it also looked
at the social implications of the new technology, Maier said.

`PIRATES OF SILICON VALLEY' PROBES JOBS-GATES COMPETITION 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS
</HEADLINE>
 By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the opening frames of Turner Network
Television's excellent new film, ``Pirates of Silicon Valley,'' we
see Steve Jobs in full charisma mode, staring straight through the
camera, and hear his rap tap-tapping off the screen at 100 miles
per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want you to think of this as just another film,'' says
Jobs (played with terrific charisma and arrogance by Noah Wyle).
``We're rewriting human history.''
</P>
<P>
   The film he's talking about isn't ``Pirates,'' and he isn't
talking to the TNT audience (he's talking to Ridley Scott, the
director of one of the most famous TV ads of all time, Apple
Computer's ``Big Brother'' spot).
</P>
<P>
   But to some minor extent he could be talking to us about this
film, because the movie is probably the best, most entertaining TV
take on the world of business since HBO's ``Barbarians at the
Gate.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``Pirates'' is about how two famously public men and their
equally brilliant college buddies rewrote human history, creating
the personal computer and the software that makes it go _ and
helping turn the world's economy, culture and sense of itself
upside down.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe this isn't just a nice way to spend a Sunday evening in
front of the television (which, incidentally, fewer and fewer of us
are doing, thanks to the personal computer and the Internet).
</P>
<P>
   The ``Big Brother'' commercial that inspired Jobs' opening rant
ran only once, during the 1984 Super Bowl, to announce the creation
of a new kind of computer, Apple's Macintosh. The splash made by
the ad, and by the Mac, represents a high point in Apple's _ and
Jobs' _ dizzyingly up-and-down life in the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   From there, this brisk and engaging tale jumps back to the early
1970s, when Jobs and buddy Steve Wozniak were still at the
University of California, Berkeley, dodging anti-war protests and
playing with little blue boxes that let them steal free
long-distance phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country in Cambridge, Mass., Bill Gates (played with
a glittering-eyed reptilian ooze by Anthony Michael Hall), Paul
Allen (Josh Hopkins) and Steve Ballmer (John Dimaggio) were at
Harvard University, playing poker, boozing in strip joints and
ogling the latest centerfold in both Playboy and Popular Mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   While Jobs and Woz were cobbling together the Apple II in a
Silicon Valley garage, Gates and Allen were writing BASIC, the
computer language that ran early computers.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, Gates and Jobs would meet, and soon enough, the
Machiavellian Gates would manipulate a hubris-filled Jobs to give
him access to the Macintosh, which Gates would blatantly copy in
his own company's Windows operating system for competing
IBM-compatible computers.
</P>
<P>
   That helped create the world's greatest fortune (somewhere
around $50 billion for Gates, depending on the stock market's
fluctuations) and one of its greatest falls from grace (and modest
return from it by Apple and Jobs).
</P>
<P>
   The film ends at the junction where Windows is introduced. There
is a quick flash forward to Jobs on a stage at the 1997 Macworld
Expo, telling the dumbstruck Apple faithful that ``the era of
competition (with Microsoft) is over.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gates looking down from a giant video screen behind him,
Jobs has surrendered (though the $150 million Microsoft investment
that, at that time, helped save Apple, which is once again
profitable and hip after several bad years).
</P>
<P>
   To push this double-tracked tale of boy-genius double-cross
along quickly, writer/director Martyn Burke relies on voice-overs
from the Woz (Joey Slotnick) and from Ballmer (now Microsoft's
notoriously hard-charging president, in the film a jocular frat
boy).
</P>
<P>
   Their voices give the story perspective, and a sense of
personality that a tale of the business rise of two ubergeeks might
otherwise have lacked. It also helps that Burke has mostly avoided
the tech talk that might have bogged it down.
</P>
<P>
   There's even some canny use of special effects (no doubt done on
a hopped-up personal computer) that in one case allows Ballmer to
explain why a pivotal meeting between Gates and then-almighty IBM
remains so important, not just to Microsoft but to us all.
</P>
<P>
   But most importantly, Burke tries to give us some sense of Gates
and Jobs, sketching in some of the dirt that makes them
interesting: Jobs taking LSD, searching for his birth mother and
repudiating his own illegitimate child; Gates fumbling pickup
lines, racing bulldozers and spending the night in jail.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake: These ubergeeks aren't like you and me.
They are high-energy, high-intensity humans, their brains and moxie
spinning at a higher clock speed than most of us. They did help
rewrite history but demanded huge sacrifices of many around them,
while creating fortunes that would have stunned Croesus.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe rewriting history is expensive. But watching them do it in
``Pirates'' is worth it. &UR;  &QL;

FORT WORTH, Texas: Maier said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The technology has to do with how we deliver the message,'' he
said. ``The psychological implications have to do with who it is
that we are reaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet use at Calvary Lutheran Church in Richland Hills is
probably most typical of how the technology is used by churches to
reach people.
</P>
<P>
   The church's leaders use e-mail to keep in touch with
denominational leaders and congregation members and to reach
potential newcomers. The church's Web site provides basic
information through its online newsletter and listings of weekly
services and events such as The Calvary Cafe, a weekly dinner
prepared by the Rev. Phil Heinze, the church's associate pastor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, church members and Web site visitors can e-mail
prayer requests, read devotionals and join a discussion board where
topics range from a sick child in the community to a recent sermon.
</P>
<P>
   For example, by logging onto the Web site, congregation members
can keep up with the progress of 4-year-old Mason Renner, who has
leukemia, and send prayers for the child and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Though his use of the Web site has slowed since Mason's illness,
the child's father, Dan Renner, said he had participated in an
online discussion group that tackled topics such as Thomas the
Doubter and Lazarus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is somewhat different because people generally have to
gather their thoughts together instead of rambling on and on,''
Renner said. ``I think you get more concise thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's Web site also provides links to online resources
such as the Internet Christian Library, a selection of Bibles and
Bible tutorials, and The Desperate Preacher,' a lectionary
discussion site for preachers preparing sermons.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have at Calvary is a Web site, and it's a reflection
of our real community at Calvary Lutheran Church,'' said Michael
Middleton, a computer professional and congregation member who
helped design the Web site. ``It's an invitation for people to join
us. It wouldn't exist if we didn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Oakes' Christian Chat Network has produced
Christian relationships that exist because of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Oakes steers clear of calling those who enter the network's chat
rooms a community, he said, because he believes that term should be
reserved for gatherings in rooms with pews.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what term he uses, Oakes has created an Internet
assembly that allows Christians to discuss religious convictions
and secular concerns while offering a way to forge friendships.
</P>
<P>
   The user can enter the network by signing on with a self-chosen
name. The user enters a ``lobby'' and can stay there and talk for a
while or head into specialty sections for teen-agers, single adults
or women, Oakes said. Some users will schedule times to meet online
and chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, it is not the most outgoing person on the
computer,'' Oakes said. ``With the anonymity, that baggage can be
taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakes also rebroadcasts a Christian music radio show online and
broadcasts a call-in show that he moderates over the network.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Lee, a divorced mother of four from Cedar Lake, Ind.,
found out about Oakes' network from a friend.
</P>
<P>
   In the confines of chat rooms protected by a filtering system
that will eject any user that contributes inappropriate material,
Lee said she has spent many evenings discussing spiritual issues
online and has made friends. She is now a monitor for two All
Singles Believers chat rooms on the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of fun,'' she said. ``But some of it is serious.
Sometimes people come in and have a problem, and they want to talk
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing the virtual with the real, Lee has physically met and
made friends with chat network users in Michigan and Illinois, she
said. A group of the users is planning to gather in Florida in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Bedell found that the people he surveyed believe that the
Internet will likely play an even more important role in religious
life in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But how it will change and help shape spiritual matters is
unclear, said Bedell, a sociologist and ordained United Methodist
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The potential exists for meaningful theological discussion to
take place on the Internet, he said, especially because it is a
means of communication worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing it simply as a tool for the local church may be to
underestimate its effects and potential, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real possibility that the future of spirituality
and religion will get worked out on the Internet,'' Bedell said.
</P>
<P>
   But even enthusiasts approach that era cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   Taking into account concerns about disembodied spiritual
communities, Oakes said he personally makes sure that he doesn't
become mesmerized by his computer screen and forsake the rest of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Oakes said he spends a chunk of most weekday evenings online,
but he also has a demanding job as a protocol engineer for a
computer company, a fiance and Kruger, his attention-hungry hound.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Chat Network operates through donations and the
fees Oakes collects for hosting Web sites, mostly for Christian
ministries and bands.
</P>
<P>
   Some months, it breaks even. Some months, Oakes uses part of his
paycheck from his regular job to pay the network's bills, which run
about $1,200 a month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the network is Oakes' contribution to Christian
ministry, his way to give something back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is truly the last open mission field,'' Oakes
said. ``I can get past the door into the bedroom and tell people
about Christ.''

TITLE OF `AUSTIN POWERS' SEQUEL TOO MUCH FOR SOME BRITISH TASTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ One person's blasphemy is another's hilarity _
depending on which side of the Atlantic Ocean you are standing on.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit No. 1: ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' the
comedy whose makers guffawed all the way to the bank last weekend
with an opening of $54.9 million, a record for a comedy or a June
debut.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is laughing lightheartedly about the name of
the hit spy flick. It's stirring a mini-tempest in the British
teapot.
</P>
<P>
   You see, in England the word ``shag'' would be uncouth if
slipped from the lips of polite folks at a cocktail or dinner
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, (use it) only if you wanted to be thrown out on your
ear,'' says British-born author Jonathan Raban, who calls Seattle
home.
</P>
<P>
   In formal terms, ``shag'' - a Brit will point out - means to
copulate. But the word seems to have whizzed by American
moviegoers, who have chosen either to ignore the word's racier
connotations or embrace more benign meanings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dictionary of American Slang, for example, defines shag as,
among other things, ``to hurry'' (Hey, shag it, will ya?) or ``to
chase something'' (shagging baseballs).
</P>
<P>
   Raban remains astonished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like putting on a movie, `The Spy Who (BLEEPED) Me.' It's
just as obscene as the American word (to BLEEP!).''
</P>
<P>
   He adds, ``I thought, `Boy oh boy, do they know what it means?'
''
</P>
<P>
   The British Consulate in Seattle on Monday was handling the
``Shag Rag'' with, well, diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Oh, no, tell him we have no comment,' '' Tina Lencioni, a
consulate officer from Seattle, said her British colleagues
shrieked when a reporter raised the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are way too embarrassed to discuss that,'' she added.
``Very proper.''
</P>
<P>
   The British interpretation of ``shag'' was immortalized by Eric
Partridge, dubbed ``the greatest of all slang men.'' He researched
words from the Reading Room of London's British Museum and produced
``A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'' before his
death in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Partridge cut to the chase; he defined ``shag'' as ``to coit.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years - and across country borders - the word has taken
on myriad meanings, from describing dance crazes of the 1930s and
'40s _ performed with vigorous hopping on each foot in turn _ to
flagging down baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   Public sport, however, was likely the farthest thing from the
minds of Singapore government officials who recently pressed to
have the movie's title shagless. They later relented.
</P>
<P>
   But Raban wonders, ``Are they going to be able to play this
movie in England under that title?'' (It opens in England at the
end of July.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is interesting that an American-distributed film can get
away with words in English which manage to sound quaint to an
American audience,'' Raban says. ``(But) to an English ear like
mine, they are still taboo.''
</P>
<P>
   New Line Cinema, the distributor of the film, says the ``topic
had been brought up'' but no decision had been made about whether
``shag'' will play in the title on British marquees.
</P>
<P>
   A company representative said the only calls about the word have
been from media. The movie, she added, ``is all about fun - and
that's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   American audiences flocked to the flick to such a degree the
movie, um, shagged the No. 1 weekend spot at the box office from
George Lucas' ``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, legions of teens and young adults _ the film's core
audience _ are laughing and repeating ``shag-a-delic phrases'' from
the adventure about a spy (played by comedian Mike Myers) seeking
to reclaim his stolen mojo (libido.)

UNLIKELY SURVIVORS PREPARE FOR NBA CHAMPIONSHIP BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ The tumultuous parallel lives of the Knicks
and Spurs will cross on Wednesday night when the players duck out
of the tunnel at the Alamodome and appear on the court of the
National Basketball Association finals like lost twins reunited
before a live audience.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the crush of pressure, these two teams will stand as
unlikely survivors of a season when they were casts as
disappointments at the start, when their ashen film-junkie coaches
were under fire, and when their All-Star centers were being nudged
into the background to make room for the hip and young Generation
Next.
</P>
<P>
   By way of miraculous recoveries during the cram session of the
lockout-shortened season and through star-aligned shots used as
charms during the playoffs, the Knicks and Spurs will find out
exactly whose side destiny is on as they begin their four-of-seven
series for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're similar in that here are two teams that have traveled on
a path people called fate,'' said the Spurs' Malik Rose after
Tuesday's practice session. ``But now, all similarities will end
with the team that wins it all.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem the Knicks are least likely to succeed. They
wandered into the cavernous Alamodome for practice as a team held
together with rubber bands and paper clips. Patrick Ewing was in a
cast, and Larry Johnson was in pain. Ewing will watch his team try
to win a title without him from the sidelines, while Johnson will
do his best to recover from a sprained knee and give the Knicks a
much-needed body.
</P>
<P>
   They are as thin as cellophane at this point. With Johnson's
availability left as a game-time decision, the Knicks have nine
healthy bodies, including the 41-year old Herb Williams. Meanwhile,
the Spurs will flaunt a healthy glow. They are rested and ready to
unleash Tim Duncan and David Robinson, their version of the Twin
Towers. The Spurs may be a bit stale from their 10 days off, but
size does not slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know San Antonio is the prohibitive favorite and have been
the dominant team in the league from March 1 on,'' Coach Jeff Van
Gundy said. ``And what we want to do is try to hang around, be in
the game down the stretch and find a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how the Knicks operate. They live for the comeback and
thrive off the drama of a dire situation. They defy all logic and
savor no-win situations. And the manifestation of this attitude has
been shown in their ability to steal Game 1 on the road in each of
their three playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here they are again. If the Knicks can sneak away with Game
1, they can put the pressure on the favored Spurs, leave them a
little tighter and a lot less confident. Although they won 10 out
of their 11 playoff games, the Spurs were vulnerable at home. They
lost Game 2 to the Timberwolves in the first round, received the
benefit of Kobe Bryant's last-second mistakes to squeeze past the
Lakers on their floor in Game 2 of the second round, and were saved
in the third round against Portland as Sean Elliott won Game 2 by
sending a thrilling 3-pointer into the dome sky off his tip-toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't play as poorly at home as we did in the first three
rounds,'' Spurs point guard Avery Johnson said. ``We can't do it
against the Knicks and get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Heat, Hawks nor the Pacers got away with it. To put
themselves in a position to shake the Spurs, the Knicks have to
pull out all of the elements they used to overwhelm the Indiana
Pacers without Johnson for the last 30 minutes of their
series-clinching victory last Friday. That means the pressure is on
the Knick guards. Allan Houston has to fight his laid-back habit of
waiting for the game to come to him, and must drive into the teeth
of the Twin Towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to turn teams into jump-shooting teams,'' Van Gundy
said. ``That's why they lead the league in defense. We were second.
Usually, that's a strength that we have over other teams. We can't
just be a jump-shooting team. We have to drive and get to the
free-throw line.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Knicks need to be undaunted by the shot-blocking tandem
of Duncan and Robinson. Another way to dilute their presence is to
attack before they set up in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to run,'' said Latrell Sprewell, who feeds
off the fast break. ``If we're running and getting out in
transition, that means we're getting stops. When that happens, we
can play with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   That's confidence. Sprewell was oozing it today. When someone
told him that his counterpart, the Spurs' Sean Elliott, was noting
how Sprewell always drives to his right, he responded with a smirk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no secret,'' he said. `'Just because he knows it,
doesn't mean he's going to stop me.''
</P>
<P>
   To open up the floor for Sprewell, the Knicks have to rebound.
This is Marcus Camby territory. But for the lanky player who has
had the tethers on his talent removed by Van Gundy and has
blossomed into a playoff star, finding a shaft of light to dash
through between Duncan and Robinson won't be as easy as it was
against Indiana. Out of nowhere, Camby sliced through the lane for
tip-ins off missed layups and swiped defensive rebounds around the
pedestrian Pacers. The Spurs watched and took note.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been unbelievable,'' Robinson said. ``Camby has really
become another player. It's like in our last series with Portland.
Brian Grant was playing awesome. We were watching TV thinking,
`Man, how are we going to stop this guy?' He's pure energy, and
that's what Camby is going to be. We're going to have to get a body
on him.''
</P>
<P>
   And just who puts a body on Robinson and Duncan? Chris Dudley is
the likeliest candidate for the Knicks, while Camby and Kurt Thomas
will alternate coverage on Duncan. The Knicks have to guard
Robinson and Duncan aggressively, but with care. Any foul trouble
could doom the chances of a team so thin on resources.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the Knicks have embraced certain doom before and
turned it into motivating force. As have the Spurs. There was a
time when San Antonio was 6-8, when its coach, Gregg Popovich, was
feeling pressure to move aside, when Robinson was being asked to
submerge his ego and relinquish the go-to role to the young Duncan
and when Mario Elie challenged his team to strip off its soft label
and irritated a few teammates.
</P>
<P>
   They got it together, though. It took longer for the Knicks, who
had to endure turmoil through 42 games of the season before their
enchanted ride to the finals took flight, before the divisions
healed and the winning began.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, with what they've been through to get here, they're a
team of destiny,'' said Avery Johnson. ``I mean, Indiana was at
full strength and the Knicks kept losing players. So obviously,
they've had something on their side.''
</P>
<P>
   So far.

 &HT;    Confusion arises over WebMD president's resignationBy Michael E.
Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like a long goodbye, the pending departure of Jay
Gilbertson from WebMD has been awkward for both parties.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Monday he resigned after seven months as
president and chief operating officer, only to shift into
no-comment mode Tuesday after Gilbertson denied having left.
</P>
<P>
   But Gilbertson did not vow to stay on, an apparent sign that
only the terms of the separation need hashing out.
</P>
<P>
   For a company that has enjoyed a stunningly rapid rise,
climaxing with April's announcement of a multi-billion-dollar
merger with Santa Clara, Calif.-based Healtheon, other executives
can certainly be found to fill the gap. But the anticipated exit is
still a striking loss: When he goes, WebMD will lose the executive
whose influence in the company's evolution is probably second only
to founder Jeff Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson, formerly co-president and chief financial officer of
HBO &AMP; Co., brought to the nascent Internet health information
company the luster of experience in helping to run a $1
billion-a-year corporation accustomed to wooing Wall Street.
Analysts greeted his arrival at WebMD as proof that the ambitious
Internet plans of the 20-something Arnold were for real.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gilbertson, 39, did not come from just any huge
outfit. He was integral to HBO &AMP; Co., which made a critical $10
million investment in WebMD in August as the company was launched.
He left HBO &AMP; Co. after the company agreed to be purchased by
McKesson Corp. _ much as he is expected to leave WebMD before its
pending merger is complete.
</P>
<P>
   And _ as before _ the explanation for Gilbertson's exit could be
as simple as corporate-style musical chairs. A merger combines two
executive teams, but there is only one set of seats. In fact, when
the deal with Healtheon was announced, a number of slots were
reserved _ but not for Gilbertson. At the time, Arnold said
Gilbertson would stay ``in an operational role.''
</P>
<P>
   But then came Monday's announcement that Gilbertson had resigned
_ and his assertion that he had not. A day later, spokesman Walter
Montgomery declined to confirm the previous day's statement and
declined all comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home Tuesday, Gilbertson said he would not provide
details until the company is ready to offer a formal statement.
``Given the fact that we are in the midst of a merger, I'd rather
not comment on it. All I can tell you is that I still work there.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Gilbertson has also been pegged to the
investigation of McKesson HBOC for accounting problems that
occurred when he had been CFO of HBO &AMP;Co. Gilbertson vehemently
denied a connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they may have seen him as damaged goods,'' said William
Michalak, analyst at Wachovia Securities. ``But when you put two
companies together, there's not always room at the top _ especially
with the plethora of management talent in the two companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Gilbertson leaves a company that is vastly different
from the one he joined. Healtheon stock was worth about $5.4
billion at the close of trading Tuesday, and the merger deal values
WebMD at an equal worth. Together, their stock value surpasses all
but a handful of Georgia companies.
</P>
<P>
   That value hinges on expectations that the combined company will
dominate the Internet's potentially lucrative health care sector.
WebMD has not started reporting quarterly results, but there is no
indication that the company is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   And the Net's health care sector grows more crowded by the day.
Companies like Atlanta-based Medcast, IDX Corp. and Eclipsys aim at
various health care providers. Sites like Dr. Koop, Intellihealth
and Atlanta-based Adam.com target consumers. On Monday,
AmericasDoctor.com filed for a public offering that could raise $60
million.
</P>
<P>
   The market is potentially huge _ but only a handful of companies
will dominate, said analyst David Restropo of Jupiter
Communications. ``Consumers are driving this, and WebMD is going to
have to snap up some consumer content companies and even some
consumer commerce companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon and WebMD are planning to file details of their merger
agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, perhaps
within a few days. Until the deal is complete in September,
Healtheon will decline comment on management decisions of WebMD,
said spokeswoman Laura Nicholson. ``They are still two separate
companies.''

REBELS MAKE VICTORIOUS RETURN TO SHATTERED KOSOVO TOWN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOGOVAC, Yugoslavia _ The Kosovo Liberation Army took Glogovac
on Tuesday morning, holding an impromptu victory stroll down the
ruined main street of this ethnic Albanian town.
</P>
<P>
   Children rushed to greet them and threw flowers on them. Some of
the fighters, in their fatigues, put pink roses in the barrels of
their Kalashnikovs, while others fired bursts of gunfire into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   They marched behind the red and black flag of Albania, just a
few miles from the last Serbian checkpoint and tank position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to say in words what my heart says,'' said
Shaban Shala, a member of the army's general staff and deputy
commander of this region, Drenica, where the insurgency was born
and where the Serbs concentrated their offensive. ``It was one year
of war, a year of suffering and pain and destruction. But this day
gives meaning to all the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Shala said he had asked one soldier not to fire into the air,
but the soldier said: ``My father was killed and my brother was
killed and your brother was killed for this day, and I will shoot
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shemsi Bajraktari, a 22-year-old fighter and former student of
electrical engineering, said his hardest moments were when he had
to watch the expulsion, abuse and murder of the civilians whom the
army was formed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt desperate and weak when we were unable to protect the
people,'' he said, a flower in his curly hair. ``On one side, it's
a victory; but from the other side, it's a defeat, because we lost
so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is his strongest emotion? Bajraktari smiled broadly.
``Victory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, he is eager to become a student again, but he
couldn't say whether the rest of the fighters were so ready to
disband their units.
</P>
<P>
   Shala, who worked as a lawyer and a human-rights advocate before
picking up the gun, said there was much sadness, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst was when we saw the population in  &UR; their  &LR; hands,''
he said of the Serbs. ``Sometimes we caused the Serbs big losses,
but that wasn't so important for us, because it would cause the
deaths of thousands of civilians. So we had to be strong and
disciplined, because we were walking on the edge of a sword.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Kosovo Albanians are grateful to NATO, he said. Earlier
Tuesday morning, he met with British and Norwegian officers. ``We
complimented each other,'' he said, and then added with no evident
irony: ``This is partly their victory, too.''
</P>
<P>
   They are to meet again later Tuesday night and again on
Wednesday to discuss the situation and the insurgents, Shala said.
He carried a sidearm and a Kalashnikov; he said the allied officers
had not tried to take them away.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the rebel army is ready to disband _ to be
``demilitarized'' in the words of the peace settlement and the
Security Council resolution authorizing KFOR, the international
force here _ Shala said: ``The people need a protection force. Now
it is KFOR. But every people needs a security force, and we will be
that force, but we will do it in cooperation with NATO and the
United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, his men and the Albanians of Glogovac listened
respectfully, shushing the little children who danced around them
tossing flowers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nuhi Hyseni, 27, has few illusions about the strength of the
insurgent army he fought for. The war had brought freedom with much
thanks to NATO, he said. But now the allies ask them to disband.
``I adore NATO,'' he said, ``but it's really hard to demilitarize
totally. You have to know what we suffered for two years in the
hills.''
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, he said, Serbs killed his brother, Shefqet, 31, a
civilian who left a wife and four children. The insurgents found
his body, along with that of a small group of refugees. But Hyseni
has not yet been able to go home to Vrbovac, a village a few miles
to the north, to find out the details.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``if we live in freedom, maybe we don't need
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The fighting was very tough, especially around the villages at
Obrinje and Banjica and Trdevac, he and the others said. ``The
Serbs had too many heavy weapons,'' he said. ``It wasn't equal, but
we fought well.''
</P>
<P>
   Glogovac, only 20 miles west of Pristina, was an entirely
Albanian town of some 12,000 people before this war. Now, it has
perhaps 5,000 people, said Daut Elshan, 45, an electrician at the
town's main industry, a ferronickel plant that has been shut for
many months.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Albanians here were pushed out by Serbian forces,
who only a month ago filled 100 buses with people and sent them
toward the Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day they came to our houses,'' Elshan said. ``They took
two of our tractors and told us they would execute our sons, and
that we would never see them again. They asked for 1,000 Deutsche
marks to save them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Serbs put a gun barrel to his throat and a knife to
his wife's eye, and threatened to cut it out unless they were paid.
</P>
<P>
   Fazli Hasi, 69, a grizzled man leaning on a cane, said: ``We
couldn't sleep at night from fear and shooting in the air. The
Serbs came day and night. They were drinking and shooting in the
air, and beat me and everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Xhevdet Bajraktari, 30, a fighter and former metalworker from
this town, could not stop grinning. Wherever he walked, people
touched his arms and kissed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fled from my house a year ago,'' he said. The Serbs had set
up an army position close to the house, so he left to join the
insurgents. ``Now,'' he said, with an enormous grin, ``I feel very
satisfied. Now I just want to go home.''

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ For Kosovar refugee Ramzi Krasnici, the
first stage of Serb troop withdrawal ended a few hours too late
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops may call the phased withdrawal smooth and successful
so far, but this ethnic Albanian wholesaler sees his future crushed
in the destructive wake of the Serbs' angry departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catastrophic,'' was the single word Krasnici, 43, found to
describe what was left at the house Yugoslavia's ethnic Serbian
military had occupied since they drove his and his brothers'
families out of the three-family building now transformed into a
junkyard of filthy, ravaged
</P>
<P>
   rooms.
</P>
<P>
   What tears his heart is that Krasnici is certain much of the
stealing and damage was done on Monday and Tuesday, as he stood
watching behind a NATO tank on the corner of his street. He
expresses no anger that NATO troops did not stop the wreckage, but
he also does not quite understand why the soldiers were so
helpless.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly is not the only Kosovar Albanian painfully aware of
the fury that attended the presence and the leavetaking of Serb
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke spiralled into the sky as late as Tuesday afternoon,
signalling where the Serbs were leaving their eloquent calling card
of torched buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Tanks and artillery rumbled through the streets of the
provincial capital Pristina all day and into the night to conform
with the Military-Technical Agreement Yugoslavia and NATO signed
last week. It calls for a three-staged withdrawal of Serb troops,
with southern Kosovo cleared by midnight Tuesday. Full withdrawal
is due by June 20.
</P>
<P>
   So far an estimated 20,000 Yugoslav forces are moving out or
have left, leaving an equal number yet to mobilize. At the same
time, 15,000 peacekeeping troops, mostly from NATO countries, have
advanced as part of the KFOR or Kosovo Force operation. Another
10,000 are waiting to enter.
</P>
<P>
   The benumbed ethnic Albanians, who were forced to leave their
homes under the Serbs' ethnic cleansing campaign, are beginning to
return like Krasnici now that withdrawal looks like a sure thing.
And, like Krasnici, they are finding appalling destruction and a
sense of powerlessness to put their lives in any order.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Shale about 30 miles southwest of Pristina,
59-year-old Agim Hoxha was among the thousands of people just
returning to their homes after spending as much as 10 weeks
roughing it in the nearby mountains. It was a return with mixed
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our houses are burned. We are living under plastic sheets,''
he said, describing conditions much like what his family just left
in the mountains. ``Now I am afraid to go in my fields. Maybe there
are mines.''
</P>
<P>
   Others also have spoken helplessly of wanting to rebuild homes
and go back to work, but having no means to do either.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason Hoxha said he came back to the village is
because his family had nothing left to eat. The villagers had been
resourceful enough to build a water mill to grind grain for a
coarse flour, and most apparently had eaten little except that
bread.
</P>
<P>
   A look around the village confirms these people have not been
decently fed in some time. Children run around on skinny little
legs. Men have made new belt notches to hold up pants that gather
in small bunches around the waist.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday did bring the first relief shipment of food, 35 metric
tons of goods including real wheat flour, cooking oil, sugar and
yeast. It was supplied by the International Committee of the Red
Cross, the first organization to get big shipments of bulk food out
to the hungry countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb legacy this village and countless others never will be
able to overcome is the deaths of so many people. Here the count is
27, including both those killed in Serb attacks on the village and
those who expired in the meagre conditions of life on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my duty to keep this list,'' said Mohamed Karpuzi, 39, an
elementary school teacher who can say how and when each one died.
``The people gave me this responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The villagers wanted to be sure these people would not be
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   So far Krasnici in Pristina has not had to deal with that kind
of contribution from the Serb forces. His family is intact, and
that ultimately must be his focus if he wants to overcome this
setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything, they took everything,'' he said, sweeping his hand
to encompass the downstairs warehouse once filled with goods from
coffee to motor oil, and the spacious upstairs apartments once
endowed with a wealth of appliances and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms that were not empty were trashed, littered with broken
window glass, empty bottles, busted furniture, food and even feces.
Toilets and sinks were smashed, and Krasnici found a suit jacket
with a three inch, v-shaped cut in the sleeve that clearly had been
made by someone wielding a pair of scissors.
</P>
<P>
   When he asked the NATO troops stationed on the corner to
intervene on Monday afternoon, a British major did cross over and
down the street to tell the Serb troops they were being closely
watched. But he said upon returning that KFOR has no right to
interfere with Serb positions until the deadline for their
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Both on Monday and Tuesday, Krasnici sometimes was so overcome
with the loss that he quietly cried, thinking about the work he had
done to achieve this place for his family.
</P>
<P>
   But that thought of family -- the fact that all had survived --
seemed the key to helping him endure and achieve again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will sleep here tonight,'' he said. ``I'll start cleaning it
one room at a time, from the ground floor up.''

CLINTON BEGINS EUROPEAN TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ President Clinton arrives in Europe Wednesday to meet
with his counterparts in the European Union and the Group of Seven,
plus Russia, with Russia's role in Kosovo still unsettled and
Europe asserting itself in diplomacy and security on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's schedule during the weeklong visit, which includes
stops in Geneva, Paris, Bonn and Cologne, Germany, and Ljubljana,
Slovenia, will be dominated by a series of bilateral talks with
America's principal partners, who also are expected to implement an
aid pact to rebuild war-ravaged Kosovo and its neighbors in
southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials are exploring the possibility of adding a
stop by the president either in Macedonia to visit Albanian
refugees or in Aviano, Italy, to salute American forces who
participated in NATO's bombing raids and humanitarian missions in
Yugoslavia. The logistics of such a trip are still being worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit comes at a critical juncture in US-European
relations, one in which disputes exist over various trade issues
and plenty of loose ends remain vis-a-vis Kosovo _ including
reconstruction of Kosovo, the immediate problem of refugees, as
well as longer-term questions of resettlement and reconstruction of
the Balkans region.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has said it wants to provide the overwhelming economic
and security presence in Kosovo, despite a weak economy,
particularly in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States for several decades has long talked about
the idea that we want Europe to be more capable, we want Europe to
be more united, we want Europe to take on a larger role in the
world,'' said Richard N. Haas, vice president and director of
foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``As some people have pointed out, be careful what you wish for.
That may indeed be happening, and the real question is: What is
Europe prepared to do? What is on Europe's agenda in the way of
enlargement? What is on Europe's agenda in the way of a new foreign
and defense policy role? How does the United States perhaps want to
influence that?'' Haas asked, framing some of the questions likely
to greet Clinton during his visit here.
</P>
<P>
   Ann L. Phillips, an assistant professor of international
relations at American University in Washington, said: ``At this
juncture, at least for the near term, what seems to have happened,
ironically, is a kind of growing sense of European self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that the United States is going to distance
itself from European problems anyway so that the only way they are
going to do deal with future situations like Kosovo is to do it on
their own,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, Clinton will find a group of European
leaders who will not be asking, ``What can you do for us?'' but
will be seeking a more equal partnership with the United States.
``It's setting off a new trajectory,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The G-8 summit will be the first since several European nations
adopted a universal currency, the Euro, which has not performed as
well as expected and certainly has not been the challenge to the
dollar that many analysts had thought it would.
</P>
<P>
   While America's economy has been humming alone just fine,
Germany is facing high unemployment and low growth rates.
</P>
<P>
   In several major European countries, dissatisfaction exists over
US barriers on steel imports, and there is tension between the US
and the European Union over such trade issues as bananas,
genetically modified organisms and hormone-fed beef, with the
United States often complaining that Europeans are not open enough
to US goods.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy analysts say Russia is likely to use the
three-day G-8 meeting to press for greater economic aid. It is
unclear how much Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is expected
in Cologne on the summit's final day on Sunday, will try to tie
economic aid from the West to resolving the stumbling blocks that
remain on the question of Russian's role in the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   James Goldgeier, who teaches at George Washington University and
is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he would
not be at all surprised if Yeltsin asks his counterparts at the
summit for ``some public signal of a commitment to a greater
economic package. He often, when he gets together with his fellow
heads of states in new settings, does ask for more money, and why
should (the summit) be any different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first two days of the summit, Russia will be represented
by Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin. Yeltsin will come for the final
day of talks and a private meeting Sunday with Clinton. Clinton's
National Security Adviser Samuel R. (Sandy) Berger speculated that
``a question of physical stamina'' may be why Yeltsin is not
attending the first two days.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrives Wednesday in Geneva, where he will pay a brief
courtesy call on President Ruth Dreifuss before delivering an
address on child labor to the International Labor Organization, the
world's leading body on promoting workers' rights and improved
labor conditions.
</P>
<P>
   He will then travel to Paris, where he will hold bilateral
sessions Thursday with French President Jacques Chirac and later
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday through Sunday, he will attend the G-8 meeting, where
besides Kosovo and a ``stability pact'' for Southeastern Europe,
leaders are expected to hold forth on subjects ranging from
international financial reforms and debt relief for heavily
burdened nations to nuclear safety in the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton will take part in the US-EU summit in Bonn
with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who is European Union
chairman. He later travels to Slovenia where he will meet with
Slovenia President Milan Kucan and Slovenia Prime Minister Janez
Drnovsek. Slovenia is a leading candidate for NATO, if and when
NATO goes forward with a second round of enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is being accompanied on the trip by Hillary Rodham
Clinton. His delegation includes Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and some 65 other officials and White House staffers.

MARKETPLACE: NASDAQ-JAPAN IS ON ITS WAY

 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The National Association of Securities Dealers took a
big step Tuesday toward the creation of an around-the-clock, global
stock market with the announcement that it will team up with
Softbank Corp. to develop a version of its electronic NASDAQ Stock
Market in Japan to trade U.S. and Japanese stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The new market, to be known as NASDAQ-Japan, will offer trading
of the 100 or so largest stocks from the U.S. NASDAQ market and
will recruit new Japanese companies that are seeking to raise
capital from Japanese and American investors. In addition, it will
seek to jointly list companies whose shares are now listed on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The new market, which is expected to open in the fourth quarter
of 2000, will seek to accommodate investors' desires to trade both
while the NASDAQ market is open in the United States _ while most
of Japan is asleep _ and during the normal Japanese trading day,
which lasts until about 1 a.m. EST or 2 a.m. during daylight time.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the two markets could together provide investors
with the ability to trade for up to 21 hours a day, closing only
for a short period either before or after the standard hours of
trading in the United States, said Frank Zarb, chairman and chief
executive of NASD, the parent of the NASDAQ market.
</P>
<P>
   Coming less than three weeks after NASDAQ said it would begin
preparing to extend its trading hours in the United States,
Tuesday's announcement demonstrates how rapidly markets around the
globe are being transformed by technology and a global economic
boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent we are successful here, it could have
implications beyond Japan,'' Zarb said in a reference to his
organization's attempts to cooperate with other financial markets
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In a possible signal of its intentions, NASD recently registered
potential names for Internet sites that combine the NASDAQ market's
name with Hong Kong, China, Brazil, India and Germany, according to
a report Tuesday by Newsbytes, an Internet news service.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Masayoshi Son, the chairman and chief executive of
Softbank, heralded the new venture as nothing less than ``a
historic moment for the whole Japanese economy and society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for young, entrepreneurial
companies that would like to have access to the equity markets in a
different fashion than they currently do,'' Son said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made clear that much of the interest in Japan would
come from Japanese investors who wanted to explore what many of
them view as a potential gold mine: initial public offerings,
particularly of U.S. Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively few Americans have wanted to invest recently in
Japanese stocks, which have been in a brutal bear market for most
of the decade. But some investment managers say the new market
could make it easier for Japanese companies to raise money from
investors, thereby stimulating the Japanese market and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious benefit is that this will be another venue for
companies to raise money in Japan,'' said David Herro, portfolio
manager of two Oakmark International mutual funds. ``If the market
has good standards, it might give Japanese companies an incentive
to be more shareholder-oriented,'' a characteristic whose absence
has often frustrated U.S. portfolio managers who invest in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Herro said, NASDAQ's entry into the Japanese
financial markets is one more blow against the monopolistic forces
that have kept foreign competitors out of Japan for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult thing about doing business in Japan is the
closed nature of the economy,'' he said. ``Anything that eats away
at the strength of Japan Inc. is for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ-Japan venture will initially receive an investment of
$4.9 million, half of which will come from NASD and half from
Softbank, the Japanese venture capital firm that has backed
successful Internet ventures like Yahoo, E(STAR)Trade, Ziff-Davis
and Geocities.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of the market is dependent on winning the
approval of regulators in both countries, as well as its ability to
cobble together the complex systems needed to support online
trading. The NASDAQ-Japan market will rely heavily on the Internet
to connect its American and Japanese constituents rather than on a
dedicated electronic system.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb cautioned that joint ventures are tricky by nature, and
they become more complicated when they involve partners from
different countries who speak different languages. Approvals for
the new market must be gained not only from Japanese regulators,
including the Ministry of Finance, but also from the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Both Zarb and Son acknowledged
that two sets of regulations could make the hurdles the venture
faces twice as tall.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ-Softbank venture is clearly aimed at expanding the
popularity of electronic trading. With NASDAQ-Japan, NASD hopes to
establish an important beachhead in a country where electronic
trading is, so far, insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   Only 36,000 online trading accounts exist in Japan. In the
United States, where online transactions account for 16 percent of
all stock trades, Charles Schwab alone has 2.5 million active
online accounts. In Japan, however, E(STAR)Trade, the electronic
broker that is 27-percent-owned by Softbank, is planning a rapid
rollout of its services in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the NASDAQ-Japan market hopes to offer Japanese
investors the opportunity to buy and trade futures contracts,
options and index products, investment vehicles that are still
oddities in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is enthusiastic about the planned venture. Alan
Davidson, president of Zeus Securities, a small broker-dealer based
in Jericho, N.Y., who is also a director of NASD, said the venture
raises the same problems for small firms as the recently approved
proposal to extend NASDAQ's trading hours _ that is, how to afford
to remain open all that time if customers want to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb said Tuesday that NASD would work to limit the
inconveniences posed by extended trading hours on small securities
firms.

 &HT;    Final preparations being made for lighthouse move
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUXTON, N.C._As soon as Thursday, the 4,800 tons of granite and
brick, wrapped in a swirl of black and white paint, that has been
an east coast landmark for 129 years begins its slow, creaking
journey to safety from crashing Atlantic waves.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds awaiting the controversial, $11.8 million rescue of the
Cape Hatteras Lighthouse are growing daily, hoping to glimpse a
move so slow it will barely be noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going for an over-land speed record,'' project
manager Joe Jakubik said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now that local officials have dropped their legal fight to block
the lighthouse's move, fearing it might be damaged, many here are
hoping that bad weather does not interfere with its projected
month-long trip.
</P>
<P>
   Churning southeast of Bermuda, Tropical Storm Arlene does not
appear to be a threat. In case of a big storm, Jakubik said his
company, International Chimney Corp., and Expert House Movers, a
subcontractor, are prepared to protect the lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest concerns, he said, would be waves crashing
over the sand dunes and possibly undermining the lighthouse along
its 2,900-foot trip inland to its new foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Crews are building a hard-packed gravel road on top of sand. The
first 850 feet of the road runs behind dunes, making it especially
vulnerable to overwash, Jakubik said. From that point, the road
travels southwest away from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In case of flooding on this windy eastern tip of North
Carolina's Outer Banks, bulldozers would push sand to reenforce the
dunes while crews would stabilize the lighthouse with timbers,
Jakubik said.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of the lighthouse falling over are slight, he said,
because of its low center of gravity. Two-thirds of its massive
weight is in the lower third of the structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It resists overturn,'' Jakubik said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, powerful hydraulic jacks have hoisted the
lighthouse 5 feet-4 inches from its sandy hole overlooking the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the railing you could feel a little vibration, but it was
not like an elevator,'' said Mike Booher, a photographer
documenting the move for the National Park Service. He stood on the
208-foot-tall lighthouse's balcony June 5 when its upward move
started.
</P>
<P>
   The 208-foot-tall structure is now at the same level as the
road, paving the way for the final tasks before the move starts.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the lighthouse base are seven steel beams. They are
resting temporarily on 9,000 4-foot long timbers, stacked like
Lincoln logs.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the bottom of the beams are 100 metal rollers. They
will travel on top of seven ``roll beams'' which are now being put
into place. Crews will lay out a mat of hardened steel on top of
the gravel over which the massive structure will roll.
</P>
<P>
   In equal bursts of power, the 100 hydraulic jacks will push the
lighthouse a foot every one or two minutes. When the structure
travels five feet, crews will reset the jacks for the next five
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The start-and-stop process makes it hard to predict when
onlookers might actually see the lighthouse move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very slow process,'' Jakubik said, ``and we want to
keep it that way.''

KEYNOTE SPEAKER DISPELS MYTHS ABOUT TV AT BANFF FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANFF, Alberta - It is somehow appropriate that this postcard
community a mile up the Canadian Rockies would host an intellectual
exchange of ideas about television at the close of the millennium.
Like television, Banff has, as they say in the business, arresting
visuals. On closer inspection, though, it's also got enough
tourist-trap cheesiness for a lifetime of macaroni casseroles.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like something you were watching last night? Perhaps it's
why the Banff TV Festival, a sort of Cannes for the small screen,
has been going for 20 years. But neither its superficial
similarities to TV nor the absence of 24-karat Riviera excess make
Banff a tin Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, its Canadian provenance is its lasting and most
endearing legacy. The festival's mission is simply to celebrate
excellence in television around the world, and with Canadian
earnestness it refuses to succumb to the popular notion that
``quality'' and ``TV'' are inherently oxymoronic.
</P>
<P>
   Typical Canadian honesty means it doesn't duck the issue,
either. So Monday's keynote address kicking off BTVF '99 was the
perfect entree to a week that includes a black-tie awards ceremony,
several seminars on writing and producing, and scores of
opportunities for writers/directors/
</P>
<P>
   producers to pitch their dreams to the movers and shapers of TV
in the 22nd century.
</P>
<P>
   The keynoter was Mark Kingwell, associate professor of
philosophy at the University of Toronto and putative successor to
the ``media maven'' mantle worn for years by another Canadian,
Marshall McLuhan. Kingwell, who used to write a TV column, called
his speech ``Fear and Self-loathing in Couchland: Why There Is So
Little Intelligent Discourse About Television, and What We Can Do
About It.'' He offered eight persistent ``myths'' about television
that create a ``buffer of protective nostrums that keeps us from
penetrating to what really matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Myth No. 1: Television is a neutral medium.
</P>
<P>
   Kingwell finds it odd that, in an age when media understanding
is still ruled by the legacy of McLuhan, many in TV cling to the
impression that ``the medium itself is just an empty conduit, a
pure vessel for content.''
</P>
<P>
   He counters: ``Television is a neutral medium the way a loaded
gun could be used to hammer in nails.'' He says the media ``extend
our senses in particular ways,'' restructuring our experiences and,
ultimately, our world. ``They are never simple chutes moving data
from one place to another; they are, instead, world-creating
machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Myth No. 2: Television is controlled by individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. And Doogie Howser is the preferred provider in my
HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Kingwell says every field has its internal norms, the things
that determine what ``makes sense.'' In the field of TV, these
norms dictate our programming choices, ``and yet we almost never
pause to examine them, ask where they came from, or wonder what
purpose they serve.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds, ``We are all players on this field. But the rules are
set somewhere else,'' - see Madison Avenue - ``and every time we
make a play ourselves, or single out an individual and hold him or
her responsible for a good or bad play, we reinforce the invisible
power of those rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Myth 3: Television is democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, shmielsen. Kingwell says the people fingering their
Nielsen buttons ``are no more genuinely responsible for the way
television is than the world-weary producers who go on giving it to
them.'' And the ``viewer'' is not so much an individual as ``an
undifferentiated mass or, at best, a demographic niche-market
slice.''
</P>
<P>
   Myth 4: Television is all junk.
</P>
<P>
   This is so obviously not true that it almost defies
mythification. But Kingwell says a preponderance of TV criticism
perpetuates the idea because the columns of so many critics after a
while ``begin to smack of disdain - for the medium, for the
readers, for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Myth 5: Television is responsible for the world's evils.
</P>
<P>
   People fear complexity, Kingwell says, and they also fear
``their own complicity in events or systems that are ugly or
corrupt.'' Thus, it's always easy to embrace the suggestion that
somebody - or something - specific is responsible for the bad
things in the world. But that, he adds, is sloppy thinking.
Unfortunately, television thrives on quick judgments of this
nature, which leads to the next myth.
</P>
<P>
   Myth 6: You can talk about television on television.
</P>
<P>
   Kingwell, a frequent TV pundit who says he's slowly learning how
to say no to producers of talk shows, used to think it was possible
to do genuine media criticism within the medium he was criticizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have intelligent discourse about television,'' he
concludes, ``you must at some point turn the television off. You
must go somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Myth 7: Intellectuals are right to disdain television.
</P>
<P>
   A popular assumption is that if Socrates were alive today he'd
be hosting a talk show on TV. Kingwell thinks not, but he does
believe Socrates would make an occasional appearance ``to ask
demanding, unsettling questions of his audience.''
</P>
<P>
   So, to all those with their noses in the air, he says: ``If it's
true that to think intelligently about television you have to turn
it off sometimes, it's also true that sometimes you have to turn it
back on - and sometimes you have to be on it. The art is in
choosing when.''
</P>
<P>
   Myth 8: Television is beyond saving.
</P>
<P>
   Kingwell is certain that individual choices do matter, ``even if
the world is larger than the sum of its individuals,'' and that
change for the better is possible. But that means ``taking more
real chances, trusting vivid imaginations, seeking the non-obvious,
the unsettling, the truly challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   His imperatives, then, for dispelling the myths and conquering
our fear and self-loathing: Go more slowly. Judge less quickly.
Reserve your blame. Challenge what seems to make sense. Question
your instincts. Never underestimate yourself (even if programmers
do). Embrace complexity. Think more.
</P>
<P>
   As McLuhan said, the medium is the message. It might as well be
a positive one.

J.F. POWERS, ACCLAIMED WRITER OF SHORT STORIES, NOVELS; AT 81 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   J. F. Powers, a National Book Award-winning novelist and one of
the most admired American short story writers of the 1950s, died of
natural causes June 12 at his home in Collegeville, Minn. He was
81.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Powers, whose work won him the admiration of such authors as
Evelyn Waugh and V.S. Pritchett, was a key figure in the cultural
emergence of American Catholicism in the postwar years. What the
Kennedys were to national politics, Mr. Powers, Flannery O'Connor,
and Thomas Merton were to literature.
</P>
<P>
   As Waugh wrote of Mr. Powers's first short story collection,
``Prince of Darkness'' (1947), he ``is almost unique in his country
as a lay writer who is at ease in the Church; whose whole art,
moreover, is everywhere infused and directed by his Faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Mr. Powers's fiction centered on the priesthood. Mixing
the sacred and the sociological, he wrote of parish priests at
their most mundane: tallying the collection plate, buying furniture
for the rectory, watching a ball game on TV. Mr. Powers portrayed
clerics as neither Bing Crosby matinee idols of sanctity nor Graham
Greene burnout cases. It was his special insight to realize that
men of the cloth are men like any other _ only sometimes more and
sometimes less so.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Powers had no rival as a chronicler of (in Waugh's memorable
description) ``the Middle West Irish priest _ chaste, philistine,
prosaic, energetic in youth, run rather to fat in age _ who
provides the strength and the limitations of the American Church.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mr. Powers did not write exclusively of the priesthood,
he became, in a sense, a prisoner of the pre-Vatican II world he
limned. He published only two books in the 34 years since the
conclusion of the Second Vatican Council.
</P>
<P>
   James Farl Powers was born in Jacksonville, Ill., on July 8,
1917, the son of James Ansberry Powers and Zella (Routzong) Powers.
He attended night classes at Northwestern University and published
his first short story in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   After the success of ``Prince of Darkness,'' Mr. Powers moved to
Ireland in 1951. He divided his time between there and the Midwest
for the next quarter century, settling in Collegeville in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   His second collection, ``The Presence of Grace'' (1956), moved
O'Connor to write Mr. Powers that ``I admire your stories better
than any others I know of.'' ``Morte d'Urban'' won the National
Book Award in 1963. ``Look How the Fish Live'' (1975) and ``Wheat
That Springeth Green'' (1988) were, respectively, a story
collection and novel. The latter was a finalist for a National Book
Critics Circle Award and a National Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Powers, who counseled his students to forgo literature for
business, taught writing at Marquette University, Smith College,
and St. John's University in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves four children: Katherine Anne of Cambridge, Mass., and
James, Hugh, and Jane, all of Ireland; and four grandchildren. A
daughter, Mary, died in 1992. Mr. Powers's wife, Elizabeth (Wahl),
died in 1988.

 &HT;    Baptist president calls for new Christian network
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Twenty years after engineering a rebellion that took
control of the Southern Baptist Convention, the Rev. Paige
Patterson took the platform as its president in the Georgia Dome
Tuesday and called for Southern Baptists to take their message to
the nation's cities, possibly through creation of a Southern
Baptist Superstation.
</P>
<P>
   The operation of such a station would probably fall under the
Alpharetta, Ga.-based North American Mission Board.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, who was re-elected by acclamation Tuesday, told his
fellow Baptists gathered in Ted Turner's hometown that there are
``critical reasons'' for a major television ministry.
</P>
<P>
   While face-to-face evangelism is best, he said, ``television
reaches through brick walls, past gated compounds, and even into
closed countries.''
</P>
<P>
   With their own station, he said, Southern Baptists could control
the message ``without the compromise we often face on Christian
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   And, since ``God has given Southern Baptists the greatest
pulpiteers in Christendom,'' he said, the whole world should be
able to hear them.
</P>
<P>
   The SBC president cited the success of ``In Touch,'' the
television ministry of the Rev. Charles Stanley, pastor of First
Baptist Church of Atlanta, as example of what individual Southern
Baptist ministers have been able to do with broadcast efforts.
Stanley has become an internationally know figure through his
television preaching.
</P>
<P>
   To fund a superstation and other urban missions, Patterson told
Southern Baptists, they must more than double their annual gifts to
denominational missions, reaching a goal of $750 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, whose conservative resurgence had as its theme the
inerrancy of the Bible, also urged his fellow Baptists on Tuesday
to stick to the Bible for preaching, counseling and doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Messengers'' to this year's convention, which ends tonight,
said they appreciated the tenor of the meeting. For many years the
convention was driven by hotly contested presidential elections.
With conservatives firmly in control, both infighting and
attendance have decreased drastically.
</P>
<P>
   From a high of more than 40,000 registrations in the mid-1980s,
this year's convention had drawn only about 11,600 messengers by
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to conventions for several years and this is about
as smooth as it can go,'' said the Rev. Rob Grimm, pastor of First
Baptist Church in Sioux Falls, S.D. ``I think the focus is on
evangelism and mission, the positive side of why we're here instead
of all the political issues of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But David McNair, a land developer from Jackson, Miss., and also
a veteran convention-goer, said he was disturbed by the low
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the leadership has lost some touch with the
churches,'' he said. ``We're still hearing the wonderful things our
convention is doing. We have the largest evangelical mission
movement in the world. It's a wonderful gathering. I question why
it's not a whole lot larger.''
</P>
<P>
   Any controversial action to come out of this year's meeting is
likely to involve the country's most powerful Southern Baptist
layman, President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The convention is scheduled to vote tonight on a motion by the
Rev. Wiley Drake, pastor of First Southern Baptist Church in Buena
Park, Calif., to ``communicate to President Bill Clinton our
strongest disapproval'' of a proclamation naming June Gay Pride
month in America.
</P>
<P>
   Another motion to tell Clinton's home church, Immanuel Baptist
in Little Rock, to discipline the president for his gay rights
stance or be ``disfellowshipped'' by next year's convention, was
ruled out of order since one year's meeting cannot bind another
year's convention to any specific action.

 SPORTS COLUMN: THE '90s ABERRATION: ITS UP TO YOU NEW YORK  
(jt) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For most of the century as the Babe consumed
everything and Sam Huff knocked down everybody and then Clyde and
Dollar Bill created perfect harmony, the rest of the country came
to hate New York teams. Justifiably.
</P>
<P>
   They were rich, big, mean, powerful bullies. They ate your
lunch, took your cake, and left laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The line ``If you can make it in New York, you can make it
anywhere,'' obviously meant that the Apple was the toughest, most
demanding arena of all.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't make it in New York, loser, take yourself to a bush
league city, which is any other city, and become the Royal of
Nowhere. Come back and we'll kill you again.
</P>
<P>
   That was for most of the century. But by the late '90s, other
teams and cities had emerged triumphant. The Dallas Cowboys, the
Chicago Bulls, even the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had become
America's teams.
</P>
<P>
   Nike was associated with Portland. The heart of American
Olympism was in Colorado Springs, its grasping paw in Salt Lake
City. Boxing came from Las Vegas and Atlantic City. The women's
sports wave was not visible from the Battery. New York was no
longer the sporting capital.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the recent championship New York teams had to be
reinterpreted, by New Yorkers, to fit the new order. The Giants,
the Rangers and the Yankees of the '90s could not be viewed as a
return to normalcy _ the greatest generation comes back! _ but
rather as aberrations, needy, overachieving therapy groups who won
in spite of themselves because the only alternative was their
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The line was changed to ``If New York can make it, then even you
can make it.'' Take heart and be inspired by the lesson of the
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lesson that the country wanted to learn. But because
the country had been conditioned for so long to hate and fear New
York as superior, it did not completely absorb the lesson until
last week. And then it hit. If the dysfunctional Knicks could get
to the final, every city's sewer has a trophy struggling to get
out. By last week, the pattern was clear: neediness wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had won because otherwise Lawrence Taylor would have
laid waste most of downtown before imploding. The Rangers won so
that Mark Messier could overcome his Great Gretzky complex and find
peace. The Yankees won as complementary medical treatments for
Frank Torre's heart transplant, then Darryl Strawberry's colon
cancer. It wasn't Gotham gargantuism anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Knicks go all the way it would be so Latrell Sprewell
and Marcus Camby can finally get the amateur shrinks, ethicists and
probation officers off their backs.
</P>
<P>
   The redemption of those once unwanted Knicks (plus their coach
and former general manager) may complete this decade's renovation
of New York's image from dirty to clean, hard to soft, from a
testing site to a nesting place. Times Square will have truly
become Disneyland and Madison Square Garden its Space Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks, as usual, have a slightly more complicated
situation than those other New York teams. While the coach is still
a central figure, his role has more texture and ambiguity. Mad Mike
Keenan and Gentle Joe Torre and Bad Bill Parcells, for all their
surface differences, were seen as managers of men who could by
force of personality or devious manipulation make their wills
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The coach as Sergeant Svengali is a stereotype that even wannabe
coaches love. New York's mayor may look like a water boy but he has
been able to snarl and sneer his way to the kind of posture of
intimidation that Parcells enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Van Gundy, despite his Bill Gates look, has not even
been portrayed as a killer nerd. All those years at the Garden and
we have never got a sense of his court intelligence or work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Could he have been Pat Riley's brain all along? We missed that
because of the traditional politics of the Garden and the custom of
reporters, in their scramble for leaks, to take public sides to
reward their sources.
</P>
<P>
   As the cases for or against Ernie Grunfeld, Dave Checketts and
Van Gundy's resistance to trading for Camby or playing Sprewell
were built, there was no easy consensus that would have answered
key questions. Could Van Gundy be a genius? Could Camby have grown
up before our eyes? Could Sprewell have been misunderstood? Or was
this just New York's new nice neediness at work? Or _ and this is
our only hope for a return to greatness _ did David Stern yearn for
Reggie Miller to misfire and spare the country a San
Antonio-Indiana final and salvage the National Basketball
Association season?
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, it means the NBA can only make it in New York.
And we're back.

GORE READY TO STEP OUT ON HIS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ After his unsuccessful run for president in
1988, Al Gore came to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided after the '88 campaign that if I ever ran again, I
would run as an older candidate,'' he deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy pause, he added: ``And I am keeping that
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, when the vice president formally declares his
candidacy for president on the steps of the century-old courthouse
in Carthage, Tenn., he'll be running not only as an older
candidate, but also one with a decided advantage in on-the-job
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The dutiful understudy to President Clinton for the past seven
years is eager to step out on his own and emerge from the shadow of
the man to whom he owes his present power and influence.
</P>
<P>
   With opinion polls showing him trailing the two top Republican
presidential candidates _ Texas Governor George W. Bush and
Elizabeth Dole _ in hypothetical matchups and an accelerated start
to the campaign season, there is a real urgency in Gore's need to
establish his own identity with the public, separate from the more
charismatic Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He is beginning to tell the story of his life, introducing
himself to voters, letting them know where he wants to lead the
country, and trying to erase the caricatures that have provided
fodder for late night commedians.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's well-known, but he's not known well by the American
public,'' said Democratic consultant Mark Mellman.
</P>
<P>
   There may be plenty of reasons why, but Gore _ who has been a US
senator, US representative, Vietnam veteran, newspaper reporter,
and divinity school student _ has not helped himself.
</P>
<P>
   He has clumsily stated his accomplishments, claiming, for
example, to have invented the Internet. He has taken much flak for
highlighting the more Rockwellian images from his childhood, saying
he slopped hogs on a farm, while ignoring his prep school days in
Washington as the privileged son of a US senator.
</P>
<P>
   His serious demeanor and sometimes extreme self-consciousness
have masked his wry sense of humor and contributed to a sense that
he is aloof or wooden or boring _ if not all three.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his suite on the top floor of a hotel here,
Gore joked that such labels were ``a total mystery'' to him.
``You're not going to get me complaining in this q and a,'' he
quipped. ``Truthfully, I think that the voters really don't know
me. In the absence of any in-depth knowledge about the candidate,
caricatures come into it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is starting to put more daylight between him and Clinton,
saying at one point, ``I think any two people are different.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect the vice president to begin rushing to
repudiate Clinton administration policies that he played a role in
creating. Instead, he said he will try to put his own stamp on
things. ``The year 2000 will bring challenges that are completely
different from the ones we faced in 1992,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Wednesday's announcement will end the ``juggling'' of
responsibilities that comes with being vice president and a
would-be candidate at the same time. He said it will let him spend
``virtually all my time'' campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formal beginning of my presidential campaign also marks
the beginning of a new kind of dialogue between me and the American
people, a dialogue in which I'm not working as vice president to
amplify this administration's message, but a dialogue in which I'm
suggesting my own proposals and vision for the future,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He went on, ``I intend to articulate a vision for the future of
our country that will make it easier for families to stay strong,
to keep our prosperity growing, to bring about revolutionary change
in our public schools, to build safer, more liveable communities
that can provide for families the structure, the support, and
connectedness that they need, and to ensure US leadership in the
world. I also want to reconnect the American spirit to the body
politic, and encourage the rekindling of the American spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's not been Gore's message that has been attracting
most of the attention, but the slow and rocky start of his
presidential campaign. During last week's heat wave, David
Letterman joked: ``It was so hot in Washington, even Al Gore's
presidential campaign was starting to heat up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton unwittingly underscored the weaknesses in Gore's
campaign when, in an effort to be helpful, the president recently
told a New York Times reporter that he had advised his vice
president to loosen up and shed his blue suit more often. Clinton
also acknowledged that he had been worried about the start to the
campaign before Gore hired former California Representative Tony
Coelho to run it.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Gore said Clinton's actions ``bordered on
lunacy.'' But the person added that the president was so dedicated
to seeing Gore as his successor that ``if he thought endorsing
Steve Forbes would help Al Gore get elected, he would do it,''
referring to the millionaire publisher and Republican presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Podesta, a Democratic strategist and adviser to Gore, said
Clinton's desire to see Gore prevail and his innate political
skills and instincts made it tempting to try to micromanage the
vice president's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't have a better fan and cheerleader and campaign
manager than Bill Clinton,'' said Podesta, brother of Clinton's
chief of staff, John Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Tony Coelho has that job, and I think the vice president
understands,'' he said, ``And he will strike out on his own, which
is what the situation requires. He'll be the leading actor in the
play. He won't be a stand-in for Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore said he wasn't being ``flip,'' when he
responded to Clinton's newspaper remarks by saying that the
president has a full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that he'll be extremely supportive of my candidacy at
the appropriate time, and I am grateful for that,'' Gore said.
``But I am quite aware that he has his hands full, and that no
endorsement or no expression of support from anyone else is very
meaningful compared to the decisions the voters make on their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was not worried about the increasing likelihood
that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will run for a US Senate
seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for her running,'' he said. ``I think she'd be a great
candidate,'' and with a bit of hestitation, added, ``I think,
likely to be elected. And I think she'd be a great senator.'' He
also said her candidacy would be ``a positive'' for his
presidential effort. ``I think it will bring a lot of enthusiasm
and momentum, not only to New York but around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether Hillary enters the race or not, Gore's advisers say
their focus is on having voters see the vice president separate
from Clinton and measuring him against the other candidates in the
field, not Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Once that happens, they say, Gore will be protected from the
fatigue factor that could affect voters after what will have been
eight years of the Clinton-Gore administration, combined with
public backlash over the Clinton sex scandal and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In a preview of a Gore campaign theme, Andrew Cuomo, US housing
secretary and a key adviser to Gore, said: ``The public wants both
change and they want continuation. They are very happy with the
Clinton economy, they don't want to change that,'' he said,
underscoring what is likely to be an emphasis on the economy, a
winning issue for Clinton over President George Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would not want to go back to a Bush economy,'' Cuomo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's supporters play down the significance of former New
Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, who is challenging the vice president
for the Democratic nomination. And despite Gore's missteps and
sluggish campaign start, they say the clock doesn't really start
ticking until he declares his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see him not finishing strong,'' said Representative
Patrick Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat who endorsed Gore during
his visit here. ``The name of the game in this business is how you
end it, not how you begin it.''

BUSH PROVES HE CAN HANDLE THE CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the charm offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush worked on winning hearts and votes
in New Hampshire and Massachusetts Tuesday with a roll of the eyes,
the lift of an eyebrow, and plenty of irreverent asides.
</P>
<P>
   In Lawrence, Mass., at the Community Day Charter School, Bush
sat next to 12-year-old Temistocles Devers as teachers explained
how they grade and teach their students. Patently bored, Bush
leaned over to the little boy, whispering in his ear, which
prompted an eruption of clicking camera shutters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, I'll try not to move,'' Bush said mischievously.
(Later, Devers said the governor had whispered: ``I know there are
a lot of pictures, but don't worry.'')
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his two-day trip to New England, the front-runner for
the GOP presidential nomination was greeted by overflow crowds of
exuberant voters. While some were uncommitted and just checking
Bush out, almost all were eager to shake his hand, touch his
sleeve, tell him their name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been involved in every campaign since 1964,'' said New
Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg, who is coordinating the Bush effort
in the first primary state. ``I've never seen this kind of energy
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his day in Derry, N.H. as the shift changed at Hadco
Corp., a circuit-board manufacturer. Sporting a navy windbreaker
with a gold Texas seal, Bush attempted to shake hands with workers
who were coming and going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, my name is George Bush, glad to meet you,'' he
said repeatedly as he shook hands.
</P>
<P>
   While most employees wished him luck, asked for an autograph, or
snapped a photo of him, a couple seemed nonplussed at finding a
presidential candidate outside their workplace at 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   One worker hurried by, barely able to avoid shaking hands. Bush
raised both eyebrows at his 250 media sidekicks and cracked, ``Oh
well, can't get every vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Another man shook hands with Bush, but then asked: ``I want to
know if you talk about issues or just shake hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush turned to the television cameras, photographers, and
reporters crowding the walkway and joked, ``You put him up to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn F. Hoffman of Londonderry, N.H. waited outside the plant
Tuesday even though she doesn't work there. ``I wanted to see him
and meet him in person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, the former director of the Currier Gallery of Art in
Manchester, N.H., also wanted to ask Bush about funding for the
arts. When she got her answer, she issued a homemade press release
concluding that Bush ``just announced that he would elminate the
National Endowment for the Arts as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in a brief interview with The Boston Globe, Bush later
said he would not abolish the NEA. He said he wanted to continue
federal funding for the arts, but give states a greater say in how
the money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to Massachusetts, Bush stopped at the Madden
Family Restaurant in Derry, N.H. to visit with breakfast-goers.
``Wow! What a start!'' proclaimed the sign welcoming Bush to the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   As the Lone Star State's governor shook hands, he moved around
behind the counter and began pouring coffee for the restaurant
patrons, shaking hands with his right and pouring with his left.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Otto, a salesman from Derry, said he supports Bush, noting
that the front-runner ``pours a good cup of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just like his father,'' Otto added. ``The country needs
another one like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, a protest preceded Bush's arrival at a luncheon
fund-raiser at the Park Plaza Hotel. Members of Stop Handgun
Violence, a Massachusetts gun violence-prevention group, called on
Bush ``to stop pandering to the National Rifle Association and to
support new common sense gun laws.''
</P>
<P>
   When told aboard his bus of the demonstration, Bush shrugged his
shoulders. ``I appreciate we ought to enforce the laws of the
land,'' he said. ``We're tough on gun laws in our state.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush took office in Texas, violent crime has dropped 17
percent, said Karen Hughes, his press secretary. She also said Bush
is not a member of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   If news of the protest bothered him, Bush didn't show it as he
went into the Park Plaza Hotel for pasta salad and sandwiches with
600 contributors. Altogether, Governor Paul Cellucci announced,
more than $800,000 was raised for Bush's presidential effort _ the
most for any Republican fund-raiser ever held in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush thanked Cellucci and said he intended to work hard and to
win. Just before he arrived, Bush said, his wife, Laura, gave him
some words of advice: ``She told me, `Don't try to be charming,
witty, or intelligent; just be yourself.' ''

SEATTLE ART MUSEUM RETURNING MATISSE PIECE STOLEN BY NAZIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Seattle Art Museum on Monday agreed to return a
Henri Matisse painting to the heirs of Paul Rosenberg, a Jewish art
dealer whose collection was stolen in France by the Nazis during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The museum board unanimously approved the decision Monday, more
than two years after the Rosenbergs claimed ownership of the 1927
oil painting titled ``Odalisque.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Elaine Rosenberg, widow of Paul Rosenberg's son,
Alexandre, and her sister-in-law, Rosenberg's daughter Micheline
Nanette Sinclair, expressed frustration last year that the museum
was taking so long to make a decision, they said through their New
York attorney Laura Hoguet they were happy with the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm entirely sympathetic with the Rosenbergs,'' said Mimi
Gates, SAM's director. ``But we had a responsibility to undertake
thorough and exhaustive research into the painting's ownership
history.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the museum had to be sure its Matisse, valued at more
than $2 million, was the one stolen and it had never been returned
to or sold by a Rosenberg heir.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said from the beginning we'd do the right thing, and that's
what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum had research conducted by its curatorial staff,
independent French scholars and the Holocaust Art Restitution
Project (HARP) in Washington, D.C., which was created by the B'nai
B'rith Klutznick National Jewish Museum to form a database and
investigate Jewish cultural losses. All evidence, said Gates,
points to the legitimacy of the Rosenbergs' claim. ``Once that was
determined, we acted quickly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   SAM was the first U.S. museum sued for restitution of artwork
lost through German looting during World War II. Last year, the
Chicago Art Institute was involved in a similar case, but the work
in question - a Degas pastel landscape - was only a promised gift
and was owned by drug company heir Daniel C. Searle.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted by the claims of the heirs of Friedrich and
Louise Gutmann, both murdered by the Germans during the war, Searle
said he refused to be extorted. Last August, on the eve of going to
court, Searle settled, ceding half interest in the landscape to the
Gutmann heirs and half to the Art Institute, which acquired the
Degas by paying the Gutmanns half of the its value.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said the Rosenbergs expressed no interest in working out a
deal to let the painting stay in Seattle. ``They wanted their
painting back,'' she said. ``We're honoring that.'' The museum now
owns one painting, two prints and a sculpture by Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Vineberg, director of the American Jewish Committee of
Greater Seattle, praised the museum for its ``precedent-setting act
of moral courage that will go a long way in helping to resolve
future and pending cases in the United States involving artwork
stolen by the Nazis during World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle collector Prentice Bloedel bought the painting in 1954
from New York's Knoedler Gallery and hung it in his living room
until it was donated after his death to the Seattle Art Museum in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The location of ``Odalisqaue'' came to light after it was
reproduced as ``whereabouts unknown'' in Hector Feliciano's 1995
book, ``The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's
Greatest Works of Art.'' Bloedel's grandson, the New York artist
Bing Wright, saw the painting in Feliciano's book and notified the
Rosenbergs.
</P>
<P>
   Art collector and museum trustee Virginia Wright, daughter of
the late Prentice Bloedel, said Monday that she's glad the issue is
resolved. She said she's sure the return of the painting will
create no tax problems for her parents' estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum is doing absolutely the right thing,'' she said.
``My parents would have hated the publicity, but I'm sure they
would be in favor of returning the Matisse to the rightful
owners.'' She said her parents couldn't have known about the
painting's real history. ``When they bought it, the Knoedler
Gallery had a great reputation. In those days, if you went to a
reputable gallery, you assumed the gallery would stand by its
material.''
</P>
<P>
   SAM attorney Stuart Dunwoody said the museum will continue its
suit against the Knoedler Gallery for ``lying about the painting's
provenance and breach of warranty.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is slated for trial in Seattle Jan. 3, but Dunwoody
said he intends to file a motion for summary judgment against
Knoedler in the fall. Lewis Clayton, attorney for Knoedler, said in
response that he doesn't think the museum has a viable claim
against his client.

BRITISH, GERMAN LEADERS REFLECT MODERATE SHIFT IN ECONOMICS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The war in Kosovo obscured something of a revolution in
another part of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, the leaders of Britain and Germany
have formalized a centrist manifesto to further distance their
leftist parties from decades of higher taxes, stringent government
economic controls and a social welfare system that is cushy by
American standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is a new balance between economic dynamism on one
side and social justice on the other,'' German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said last week as he and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair announced the publication of their plan. ``We would like to
reclaim some economic competence.''
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, called ``The Third Way'' by Blair and ``The New
Center'' by Schroeder, stresses labor and welfare reform,
entrepreneurship and tax cuts to encourage creation of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The new pact will greet, and no doubt be hailed by, President
Clinton as he arrives Wednesday for a European visit that includes
the annual economic summit of the seven leading developed market
democracies and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Much as the conservative troika of President Reagan, British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
dominated the trans-Atlantic alliance of the 1980s as the Cold War
wound down, the refashioned center-left pragmatism of Clinton,
Blair and Schroeder is seeing out the century and dominates Western
planning for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Schroeder also would clearly like their moderated
vision of the role of government, already informally accepted by
other national leaders on the continent, to overtake the
traditional leftist agenda that has been the blueprint for the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   An EU move to the right will almost certainly _ and for Blair
and Schroeder unexpectedly _ be hastened by the left's poor showing
in European Union Parliament elections held last Thursday through
Sunday. The body's center-right grouping won the largest number of
seats for the first time since the supra-national body first met in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Clinton's first overnight stop will be in France,
where Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin pointedly refused to
sign on to the Blair-Schroeder project.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major leftist parties, only Jospin's Socialist held
its own in the EU voting.
</P>
<P>
   Much as former French President Francois Mitterrand often
enjoyed being odd-man-out in the trans-Atlantic alliance in the
1980s, Jospin says he will go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be true to ourselves first of all,'' Jospin told a
political rally in Toulouse last week. ``There is a certain
originality in French socialism that must be preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, during his two-day state visit to France, may find he
has more in common with President Jacques Chirac, a center-right
Gaullist, than Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Bayrou, leader of Union for French Democracy, said
Jospin's coolness to the Blair-Schroeder enterprise confirmed that
French Socialism meant more regulation, a 35-hour work week and
more taxes. ``Jospin is really the most archaic of European leaders
_ the last of the left-wing Mohicans,'' Bayrou told London's
Guardian newspaper last week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew from Washington to Geneva for a speech Wednesday to
the International Labor Organization and was then to travel on to
Paris. The annual summit is in Cologne, Germany, over the weekend.
Clinton will visit briefly in Slovenia, one of the most
economically dynamic pieces of the former Yugoslavia, before a
scheduled return home Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is a model for many of the European leftists who
recently have led their parties to victory after years out of power
because voter distrusted their economic policies. The U.S.
Democrats' losing years embodied by George McGovern, Walter Mondale
and Michael Dukakis have many European leftist counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, whose Labor Party languished in opposition from 1979 to
1997, sent representatives to consult closely with Clinton
operatives as he began to wean Britain's Labor Party from its
socialist past.
</P>
<P>
   In the run-up to the 1997 British election campaign, Blair used
phrases and symbols straight from Clinton's voter-tested message of
moderation.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, whose Social Democratic Party had been out of power
almost as long as British Labor, was less directly dependent on
Clinton's rhetoric in his victory last year but clearly was
impressed by the American's electoral success.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who recently said the social welfare system cannot be
``a hammock,'' claims to have been working on moderation of his
party for a decade. In 1994, he was forced out as a government
opposition spokesman after his claim that there were no left-wing
or right-wing economic policies, only ``correct ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder faces a more difficult road in getting his party,
which is further to the left than his compatriots in either the
United States or Britain, to buy into the ``new center'' plan. The
path was cleared somewhat in March when one of the Social
Democrats' old big-government mandarins, Oskar Lafontaine, quit as
finance minister and party chairman, in a dispute over Schroeder's
more moderate line.
</P>
<P>
   In unveiling their proposal, Blair said center-left parties will
be allowed to remain in power only ``if we back to the hilt the
potential for innovation and enterprise to generate new growth
potential and more jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In advance of European Union Parliament elections, Blair sought
to use his new deal with Schroeder to deflect voter attention away
from his party's plan to eventually adopt the new euro currency and
ditch the British pound.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said his proposal with the German chancellor was proof
that Britain faced only one choice, ``leading Europe or leaving
Europe.'' The new plan, he said, showed Britain was ``a modern
nation with influence again.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair may want to rethink his tactic, because British
Conservatives, on the heels of an anti-euro campaign, doubled their
share of EU Parliament seats in the voting. Schroeder's forces
fared as poorly in balloting in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the election, Francis Maude, the Conservative Party
economic spokesman, said the prime minister's venture with
Schroeder was splashed with hogwash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to be fooled by Tony Blair's ludicrous claims
that he and Chancellor Schroeder are committed to cutting taxes in
Europe,'' Maude said. ``The German government is committed to tax
harmonization (throughout the EU), which would mean higher taxes in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Clinton's dedication to ``New Democrat'' centrism has
been questioned in the United States, some skeptics wonder whether
Blair and Schroeder really believe in the policies they are
advancing or fear the voters' reaction to unvarnished socialist
economic doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree that there must not be any reversion to the failed
policies of the 1970s,'' Blair said in a news conference last week
with Schroeder. But is that a core belief or bit of political
pragmatism?
</P>
<P>
   The text of the Blair-Schroeder pact takes strong note of the
political realities, saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``Public expenditures as a proportion of national income has
more or less reached the limits of public acceptability.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABU GHOSH, Israel _ Driving his gleaming black Cadillac through
the rutted roads of this village outside Jerusalem, Jawdat Ibrahim
talked about his miserable childhood. It was miserable even by the
relatively abject standards of an Israeli Arab born 34 years ago in
a country that considered him second class.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 4, he sat beside his father on a bed as the man, for
reasons never known, took his life _ drinking poison, then fading
away. His mother, bereft, raised her six children in a cellar with
a dirt floor, the only finished part of the house his father had
intended to build. There was rarely enough to eat, and what Ibrahim
remembers most is feeling lonely in a village that was technically
one big family.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in a melancholy mood, Ibrahim still seems somewhat
lonely, although he has literally gone from the cellar to the
penthouse. He narrated his story on the expansive terrace of one of
his marbled, Jacuzzi-filled townhouses here, a few blocks from his
fancy restaurant in the center of town. Then, in butter-soft
leather loafers, he glided down the polished stairs.
</P>
<P>
   The terrible circumstances of his youth, he said, created a
philosophy in his home. Determined to treat others with the respect
she was often denied, Ibrahim's mother raised her children not only
to consider themselves the equal of everyone, Jew or Arab, but also
to consider everyone their neighbor. It was a mindset that planted
itself deep inside Ibrahim as a bud of self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   It stayed with him even as he fled to Chicago, where his uncle
lived, and as he drove a tow truck through frigid Midwest winters,
bailing out luxury vehicles trapped in snowbanks.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim had no grand design for the future when he bought his
first and last lottery ticket in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But when he won a $17.5 million jackpot in the Illinois State
Lottery, he took it as destiny. He was forced to sue to get the
prize, denied him on a technicality; the lawsuit increased his
earnings to $22.7 million. He embarked first on an extended
shopping spree. Then, in 1992, with the option of moving anywhere
in the world, he chose to return with his millions to this
pocket-sized traditional town _ to his home, his clan.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim has parlayed the money into a peculiar role for himself
_ not only inside the town, which he helped remake, but in Israel
as a whole, where he used new-found access to designate himself an
emissary of peace, brotherhood and protexia (the Hebrew word for
pull, or connections).
</P>
<P>
   ``Jawdat is an open guy after all those years in the States,''
said Sallah Tarif, an Israeli Arab member of Parliament with the
Labor Party. ``This is the kind of type we need here in order to do
something with ourselves, to advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he returned from the United States, Ibrahim opened
the elegant Abu Ghosh restaurant, starting a trend that has
considerably helped the economy of the town. Abu Ghosh, whose
working people used to solely commute to factories every day, now
has a full row of locally owned restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturdays, the town is jammed with secular Israeli Jewish
tourists. For most of the tourists, it is their only contact with
Arabs at all, inside or outside Israel. But most do not come for
political reasons; almost every restaurant in nearby Jerusalem is
closed for the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ibrahim, who shmoozes in Hebrew with his customers,
thinks of it as a kind of peace industry. And he points to the
Israeli-U.S.-Palestinian negotiations that have taken place at his
restaurant as evidence that he has created a kind of halfway house
between worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think that I have put Abu Ghosh on the map as a
symbol of peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Israeli Arabs should be the bridge of peace. Israelis have
to have peace with us first, then they can think about Lebanon and
Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ghosh has always had a strange standing in the Israeli Arab
world. It was seen as a ``collaborator's village,'' because the
mukhtar, or leader, of the clan who lived there made a decision 50
years ago not to fight the Israelis in order to preserve the town.
</P>
<P>
   Superficially it looks better off than most Israeli Arab towns,
but Ibrahim said that four or five families are squeezed into
almost every house. The town, half the size it used to be, is
hemmed in by a highway and Jewish developments. Now, when someone
is tempted to sell land to an outsider, Ibrahim rushes to buy it
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love buying land, especially in Israeli Arab villages,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Ibrahim's goal has been to reconnect Abu Ghosh with the
Israeli Arab world, to make it clear that their problems are
shared, that ``we are brothers.'' His Abu Ghosh Foundation finances
projects for Israeli Arabs throughout the country, from youth
leadership programs and technology training to prenatal care and
direct cash grants to cover the medical costs of the very poor.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also awards about 40 scholarships a year, to both
Arab and Jewish students _ ``so that maybe some Jewish foundation
will do the same in reverse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He himself barely made it through high school, mostly because he
was working nearly full time after class, tending the backyard
gardens of Israeli Jews. Possessed of considerable chutzpah, he
later tried his hand at running a small ceramics factory in the
heart of Jerusalem _ after talking the aging Jewish owner into
leasing it to him for a pittance.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not a businessman, and when he ran to the United
States, he was fleeing a mountain of debts. He persuaded a travel
agent to sell him a plane ticket on credit, and flew off to Chicago
to find his uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, his return was triumphant but difficult, reconciling
the pain of his past with the power that the lottery money has
brought him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come and ask me for things now,'' he said, ``I
can't help but ask myself where were those people when I was a
child.''
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to an American he fell madly in love with,
started in Las Vegas and ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, his second wedding was a grand affair, a Muslim
wedding held at the Notre Dame Church in the heart of town and
attended by a who's who of Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian
political figures. His mother and his 100-year-old grandmother
beamed with pride. They had persuaded him to consent to an arranged
marriage to a young woman from his extended family.
</P>
<P>
   He was told that love would grow, he said, but it didn't work.
He and his wife are separated, he said sadly, standing in front of
a birthday card framed and displayed on the bar of his restaurant.
It's from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The break-up was not his only recent disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years, the Interior Ministry, which was
controlled by the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, has run the town. The
mayor and the entire council were religious Jews, appointed by
Shas. Finally, the town held its first elections for Mayor early
this year. Ibrahim ran _ and lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's young, and he was away for a long time,'' said Dr. Subhi
Abu Ghosh.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we behaved no differently from those in any other
democratic race, we didn't necessarily elect the best.'' Pensive
about his ups and downs, Ibrahim has tired of the assumption that
his lottery earnings have fueled his successes and fed his
failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make myself myself,'' he said. ``It's not the money. It's
me.''

BUSH TREADS THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD ON ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The strategy behind George W. Bush's broad,
fill-in-the-blanks agenda has been on clear display this week. He
is running as if the presidential nomination is already sewn up and
is positioning himself in the middle of the American political
spectrum for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, of course, says he is taking nothing for granted and will
campaign hard in New Hampshire. But Bush is betting that New
Hampshire Republicans, as well as those across the country, are
more interested in a nominee who can win in November 2000 than one
who tries to run to the right on all the conservative issues that
dominate primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Texas governor's signature call for ``compassionate
conservatism'' is turning out to be quite a lot like the strategy
employed by President Clinton, who beat Bush's father in 1992 by
running as a ``new Democrat'' who also ran toward the middle.
</P>
<P>
   For the short term, the Texan's strategy appears to have worked,
with undeniably enthusiastic crowds and support. But some of those
who were impressed said they will be taking a closer look between
now and primary day, tentatively scheduled for early February.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got great charisma,'' said Doug Blampied, who heard Bush
speak at a fire station in Bow, N.H. ``I think he said pretty much
the right things from my pespecitve. But I am just going to have to
wait to be more clear about how he will accomplish these things.''
Blampied is not alone; 73 percent of those surveyed nationally in a
CNN poll last week said they wanted to know more about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   So would Blampied sacrifice some of his conservative principles
if he were convinced Bush could win in November 2000?
``Absolutely,'' the retired insurance company executive said. That
view is echoed by many Republicans across the Granite State and
explains why Bush can run a general election strategy in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's first act in New Hampshire was to apologize for being the
last candidate to arrive. But after two days here, as well as a day
in the first-caucus state of Iowa and a brief visit to
Massachusetts Tuesday, it was apparent the delay had paid off. The
anticipation resulted in a news media mob that grew to 300, more
than usually follow a candidate at the end of a close campaign.
Bush also made the covers of Time and Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to think how it could have gone better,'' said Bush
spokesman David Beckwith, whose job is to put the most positive
spin on the governor's visit. ``I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made no apology for his lack of specifics, saying the time
for 10-point plans would come later. And there were many blanks to
be filled in, with Bush refusing to explain his plan to cut taxes
or privatize Social Security. At the same time, Bush sought to
obscure his position on some issues. Instead of saying he was
against affirmative action, for example, he said he was for
``affirmative access,'' which he described as a plan to get the
individuals into top schools regardless of race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush never mentioned his antiabortion position until he was
asked about it by a reporter, which resulted in the governor's
saying that he would not impose an abortion litmus test in
nominating judges.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most revealing comment by Bush came when he
acknowledged he has not put together a specific program of
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time this campaign is over, I will have an agenda, a
clear agenda, that people can understand,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush kicked off his campaign swing in a jocular manner, calling
his jet ``Great Expectations'' and handing out baseball-themed
luggage tags that asked reporters to rate his trip from a grand
slam to ``back to the minors.'' But Bush's strategy wasn't to hit
anything out of the park; instead, it was to make it through his
Opening Day in Iowa and New Hampshire without any errors.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after arriving in New Castle, N.H., an upscale
coastal community, Bush got a preview of the potential downside of
being the front-runner. A local reporter stood up at a news
conference and noted that Bush has called for a new era of
responsbility while declining to explain his statement: ``When I
was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible.'' Bush
nearly lost his temper, saying that he made mistakes while refusing
to explain them.
</P>
<P>
   While that took care of the question for the moment, it is far
from clear whether Bush can brush off the query month after month,
especially if it is raised directly by one of his opponents in a
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign style revealed a split personality. When it came
to plunging into crowds and greeting voters, Bush was Clinton's
equal, smiling sincerely and searching out the most relucant person
in the back of a crowd for conversation. At an Iowa event that
attracted 500, Bush remained to shake hands until nearly everyone _
including most members of the news media _ had departed.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to Bush's public speaking, he was as scripted
as any candidate, a point that seemed overlooked because of the
freshness of his candidacy. He repeated his favorite applause lines
about compassionate conservatism and the need to ``leave no
children behind.'' Even at the emotional high point of the trip,
his joint appearance with his parents at the family compound in
Kennebunkport, Maine, Bush's comments were nearly all repetitions
of past statements.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the low-risk nature of the trip, Bush's visits
were nearly all to politically safe venues, meeting with invited
supporters or contributors. By no means did he fulfill his vow to
look voters in the eye or appear on every porch to ask for support.
Instead, his message was mostly conveyed through the news media,
which treated his trip with all the importance accorded to a
presidential visit.

 &HT;    Delta, pilots recess 777 talks after failed meeting
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Negotiators for Delta Air Lines and its pilot union
met Tuesday but exchanged no new proposals on Boeing 777 pay rates,
dimming the chances of a last-minute deal that would salvage
Delta's original plans for adding the big jets. Both sides say they
remain willing to meet again.
</P>
<P>
   Delta last week announced it was postponing all further 777
deliveries and laying plans to sell the two it now has, citing an
impasse over pilot pay rates after five months of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier, which had planned to have 11 777s by next summer,
said it would reschedule the deliveries ``if and when'' a pay pact
is reached. The issue may become part of new contract negotiations
that begin in September.

SERBIAN CHURCH URGES MILOSEVIC AND HIS CABINET TO QUIT 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also KOSOVO-CHURCH) 
(nk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In a rare direct challenge to President
Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian Orthodox Church called on him to
resign Tuesday, as Milosevic has thrown himself into an unusually
energetic campaign to rally a disillusioned and depressed public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demand that the federal president and his government resign
in the interest and the salvation of the people, so that new
officials, acceptable at home and abroad, can take responsibility
for the people and their future as a National Salvation
Government,'' the holy synod, the church's highest body, said in a
statement, the independent Beta news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Although the church has been critical of Milosevic's policies in
the past, it has never before demanded his resignation. The timing
of the announcement, so soon after the peace deal, also suggests
that the influential church would like a new leader for a new era
in Serbia. Opposition politicians are also increasingly calling for
new elections and a change of government.
</P>
<P>
   In what some analysts are interpreting as a desperate action to
salvage his political career, Milosevic has embarked on a rare tour
around the country, making his second visit to inspect bomb damage
in two days. His visit to Novi Sad on Monday, and his walk amid
crowds of cheering supporters Tuesday, marked his first public
appearances since October 1997, when he toured Mionica in central
Serbia, which was devastated in an earthquake, the VIP news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly unusual what he is doing,'' said one local
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic still controls the crucial levers of power, namely the
security forces, and does not look close to losing his grip. But
the Orthodox Church's call for his resignation has added to the
speculation about Milosevic's political future, when he is already
damaged by the recent indictment from the International War Crimes
Tribunal, and as he faces the end of his presidential term in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   While only a small minority of the population practice religion,
the church does bear some moral weight. But the church's position
represents the loss of an important portion of support for
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The church also expressed deep concern over what has happened in
Kosovo, in particular the recent exodus of Serbs. The church called
on the international peacekeeping forces to provide protection to
the Serb civilians and to the many Orthodox monasteries and
churches there, including the ancient seat of the Serbian Church in
the town of Pec in western Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The holy synod also urged Serbs not to leave the province. ``We
also appeal to our brothers in Kosovo to stay in their homes and
not to leave their relics, convinced in the truth of Jesus Christ's
words that `Those who endure till the end will be saved.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who built his career on championing the Kosovo Serbs,
has now dropped them unceremoniously. Well over 30,000 have fled
their homes in the province in the last four days, according to the
Yugoslav Red Cross, and they have received barely a mention on
state television.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic clearly feels the need to woo back the public to his
side after the war, which at first drew the people behind him in
patriotic fervor against NATO but which is now widely seen as
disastrous for the country.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Monday he announced the launching of the
reconstruction of Serbia. Tuesday he was back on the road, visiting
Aleksinac in southern Serbia, walking onto the city's main highway
bridge, which was hit several times by NATO missiles. The visit was
covered extensively on state television, along with a laudatory
appraisal of the president's patriotic performance during the war.
</P>
<P>
   While many Serbs still blame NATO, opposition politicians are
becoming more outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Radical party, the ultranationalist party of deputy
premier Vojislav Seselj, announced it was leaving the government on
Monday. Seselj and his followers, who include 15 ministers in the
current government, had vowed to leave their posts if foreign
troops ever occupied Serbian land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Kosovo is now occupied we have no reason to remain in
the government,'' Seselj said, adding that one of the only reasons
the Radical Party joined the government had been to defend Kosovo
Metohija, giving the province its full Serbian name.
</P>
<P>
   The departure from the government of the Radical Party was
immediately placed in doubt by the Serbian president, Milan
Milutinovic, who adopted a decree Tuesday ordering all government
officials to remain in their posts.
</P>
<P>
   Seselj, who sees himself as a rival to Milosevic, is a skillful
politician but may lose support once he loses access to the
national media.
</P>
<P>
   If the Radical Party does leave the government, it opens the way
for changes. Milosevic may invite the main democratic opposition
leader, Vuk Draskovic, head of the Serb Renewal Party, to join the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who participated in Milosevic's government as deputy
prime minister for several months this year, said Tuesday he would
demand ``fundamental democratic reforms'' before joining the
government again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are not ready, and are ready to continue with their
wrong policy of leading Serbia to disaster, the majority of Serbs
would not allow that,'' he told a news conference here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Draskovic did not go as far as calling for Milosevic's
resignation but suggested he should perform a more ceremonial role
as a head of state. Draskovic instead attacked the powerful
Yugoslav prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, saying he should be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   It may suit the Yugoslav president to shuffle his government.
Milosevic may try to use politicians such as Draskovic, and the
president of the republic of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, to court
western aid and investment to help rebuild Serbia. A change may
also appease the public who face a grim next six months of economic
hardship, including shortages of electricity, heat and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Unless he changes the rules, Milosevic is not permitted to run
again, after two consecutive terms as president of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He may be tempted to call early elections and change the rules,
analysts say, although that would be both expensive and risky. He
is also hampered by the situation in Kosovo, since many of his
party seats were won in the southern province. It is unlikely that
Kosovo will participate in national elections soon and Milosevic
can no longer count on strong support from the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fed up and that's all I have to say,'' says a man in
Nis, out window-shopping with his wife and small daughter. As for
the future, he refused to say.

SENATE TO OK BENEFITS BILL FOR DISABLED WHO WANT TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to encourage millions of disabled Americans
to join the work force, the Senate reached agreement Tuesday on a
bill that will allow them to keep their federal health benefits if
they find a job.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote overwhelmingly Wednesday for what
supporters call a ``bill of independence,'' co-authored by Senators
Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and James M.
Jeffords, Republican of Vermont. It would allow states to extend
Medicaid benefits to any of the 7.5 million Americans who are
qualified as disabled and become employed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill addresses what some say is a Catch-22 in current law,
which forbids people who work from receiving federal disability
benefits, including health insurance. The measure is estimated to
cost $838 million over five years, but that is expected to be
offset somewhat by a $68 million savings, as more disabled people
pay taxes and fewer rely on Social Security Insurance, a cash
benefit many disabled now receive.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, President Clinton hailed the agreement as
a step toward equality for the 54 million people who live with
mental or physical impairments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a profoundly important piece of legislation,'' Clinton
said. A version of the bill has been approved by a House committee
but no vote has been scheduled by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   As well as bringing opportunity and independence to the working
disabled, Clinton said the measure represents an economic victory
because more Americans would become taxpayers, contribute to Social
Security, and broaden the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   Mounting pressure from Democrats and Republicans alike, as well
as effective lobbying by disability groups, prevailed over
opposition to the bill by some conservative Republican members,
including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who had concerns about how to pay for
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, disability groups picketed Lott's Mississippi
offices, and Senate Democrats, all of whom supported the bill,
threatened to criticize Lott and other Republicans for refusing to
move the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a culture where work is highly valued, and people
with disabilities have been denied the chance to work,'' said Paul
Spooner, director of the Metrowest Center for Independent Living in
Framingham, Mass. ``This is the best thing that could happen to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to remove the unconscionable barriers that prevent
so many citizens with disabilities from working and living
independent lives,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, disabled people are discouraged from working
because they lose their disability coverage if they earn $500 a
month. Because so many people with disabilities have expensive
medical needs and are excluded from private health plans, the law
is a barrier to those who want to work but cannot afford to give up
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work-incentive bill will raise this cap to a realistic
level of $75,000 (a year), allowing many disabled individuals to
return to the work force,'' Jeffords said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 7.5 million Americans who receive disability benefits,
only one-half of 1 percent work. But while 75 percent of all
disabled people are unemployed, a 1998 Harris poll found that 72
percent of the unemployed want to work.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jeffords, if only 1 percent of those with
disabilities work, taxpayers would save $3.5 billion over those
workers' lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   As well as allowing states to extend Medicaid benefits, the bill
gradually phases out cash benefits to disabled Americans as they go
back to work. And it would fund job-training and worker-assistance
programs, as well as provide the security that if the job did not
work out, the workers with disabilities would still have access to
their benefits and cash assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also set up a $300 million program over 10 years
to allow some people to keep Medicare coverage while working, as
well as a pilot project to allow states to give people threatened
with disability in the future _ those with arthritis, multiple
sclerosis, or HIV _ access to Medicaid coverage for prescriptions
that might allow them to stay healthy and keep their jobs.

SCHOOL RESPONDING TO MINORITY TENURE CHALLENGE, DEAN SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Last week, in a graduation address at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson challenged the school's administration to double the number
of tenure-track minority faculty in the next one to two years.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 106 professors at the Kennedy School, only six are black,
a school spokesman said. Of those, only one is tenured and two are
on tenure tracks. The other black tenured professor, Judge A. Leon
Higginbotham Jr., died last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pushing on an open door,'' said Dean Joseph S. Nye,
Jr., who said that since he had become dean three years ago, half
of the 24 new faculty members were minorities or women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that enough? No. Are we trying? Yes,'' Nye said.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of matching the actual number Jackson called for,
academic dean Fred Schauer said he couldn't give a definite answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in terms of efforts, we should double, triple and
quadruple,'' said Schauer, who has served as academic dean for the
last two years. ``It is a source of enormous concern and enormous
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a serious problem with the number of African-American
faculty,'' said Schauer, who added that the problem with the number
of black tenured faculty was more serious than any other ethnic
group. Associate professor Keith Reeves, who is black, is leaving
for Swarthmore College.
</P>
<P>
   The school also has two Latino-Americans and seven
Asian-Americans on its faculty, said Schauer.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Jackson has criticized Harvard for its
faculty hiring practices. In 1990, he came to Harvard at the
request of Harvard Law School students to discuss minority hiring
at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Today, out of 76 tenured law faculty, six are African American,
one is Latino and one is Native American, said a spokesman for the
law school.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologist and university professor William Julius Wilson, the
Kennedy School's only tenured black, said that he and the school
administration have been working on identifying outstanding
minority scholars to recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a problem we are trying to correct. For the last several
weeks, we have been putting together a wish list of people,'' said
Wilson. In the fall, a faculty committee will start reviewing
applications for positions.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the pool of qualified candidates who
emerge from the rigorous selection process is small, said economist
Ronald Ferguson, a black who has been a member of the faculty since
1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really musical chairs. We are just trying to suck up a
larger fraction of a very small pool,'' said Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law school got Lani Guinier, but now the University of
Pennsylvania doesn't have her,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Lani Guinier became the first tenured minority woman
professor at Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are willing to compete within the pool, Nye said. ``But the
best is to expand the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said one reason for the small pool of candidates is
because it has only been recently that African-American scholars
have paid more attention to public policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, they were addressing more pure science, non-policy
relevant issues. They were focused on testing hypotheses instead of
applying theories to correct major problems,'' said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any school is in the position to attract these scholars, it
would be the Kennedy School.''
</P>
<P>
   Identification and recruitment of minorities into academic paths
must start earlier, so they aren't lured into the business and law
worlds, said Nye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those opportunities are just more lucrative. They can go to
school for half the time and earn twice as much,'' said Nye.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity to hire more minority faculty is there, since
there is a reasonably high degree of faculty turnover at the
Kennedy School,'' Schauer said.

SPORTS COLUMN: ONCE FOUNDERING, A TEAM DISCOVERS ITS GRAND
SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A very astute friend of mine made an interesting
observation the other day. She compared the Knicks to the Olympic
figure skater, Nancy Kerrigan, who once took a well-timed whack to
the knee and then went on to the performance of her life.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't win the ultimate prize, but under duress and the
global celebrity scope, she did glide triumphantly away from her
reputation as an underachiever in the grand spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Knicks have indeed taken a Tonyaesque whack or two
as they made an unsuspecting turn from the road to ruin, leading to
the National Basketball Association finals beginning here tonight
against a quality Spurs team that doesn't yet know what it's got
itself into.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, the franchise player who was relegated to
ordering his teammates to ``get me my ring.'' Ernie Grunfeld, the
general manager who's been banished from his own architectural
triumph. Jeff Van Gundy, Larry Johnson, Allan Houston, Latrell
Sprewell, Marcus Camby, the two-headed point guard known as Chris
Childs and Charlie Ward _ they have all taken turns getting whacked
in various and most creative ways and occasionally by each other
for being in the way of a competing or antagonistic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional basketball wisdom suggests these Knicks are about
to meet their match but somehow, some way, they have made a most
unlikely transformation from a fractious gathering of victims whose
battle cry was a well-known Nancyism _ ``Why me?'' _ to a spirited
collective that is sizing up the favored Goliaths from San Antonio
and asking, ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   These Knicks have become, according to Coach Van Gundy, ``a true
team,'' an assertion recently given a most flattering validation
when Chris Dudley got a telephone call from Dick Kuchen, his former
coach at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `As a coach, it's just so nice to see a team discover
itself,' '' the Knicks' gangly center said. ``Everybody has found
his role. It sounds so easy, but it's not so easy to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the self-destructive mediocrity this very team was,
it is also difficult to understand, which could be why, in the
spirit of a season previously given to assigning blame, we have now
entered the equally contentious realm of granting credit. To wit:
Camby is the primary reason for the Knicks' sudden surge. No,
Sprewell is, and you've got to be blind not to see that. Wait, but
wasn't it Van Gundy who nurtured these indifferent refugees from
losing teams, hardened them to the point where they could be
Broadway stars? Please, he never wanted either of them, and is now
unjustly reaping the fruits of the deposed Grunfeld's labor.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for Game 1, came permission to focus on the sum and
not the parts.The authentic team stamp of approval from a living,
breathing, retired-number Old Knick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley and I were talking about it,'' Dave DeBusschere said
the other day. ``When Childs is pushing the ball, and they have
Sprewell, Camby and Houston running, they're the fastest team in
the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, all right, he didn't say smartest, the distinction
delicately preserved through the years for the championship Knicks
of 1970 and 1973. DeBusschere did say his children have admitted to
him that while they are happy for these Knicks, they are concerned
about this motley crew treading into sacred territory, should it
win it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `Jeez, what are you talking about?' ''
DeBusschere said. ``We won our second title 25 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six, but who's counting? What should be noted is that the
Houston-Camby-Sprewell Knicks just finished dispatching from the
playoffs an Indiana Pacers team whose egalitarianism was
reminiscent of the Old Knicks. Eras pass. Styles change. Forget,
for the moment, Red Holzman's teams. These Knicks who are sleek and
swift are much more fun, night in, night out, than the canned
vegetables cooked up in New York by Pat Riley earlier in the
decade, a repulsive form of thug ball still being served to the
audiences in south Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It has been my contention for a couple of years that only some
kind of emotional coup d'etat was going to dislodge Riley's
coach-must-control ethos that was so infused in the New York
basketball psyche. Don Nelson's insurgence never had a chance. Van
Gundy was hired to restore peace, to please Patrick by continuing
to subsist by posting him up. The Knicks plodded along, four years
running a second-round loser.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing for his job, Van Gundy rode Ewing until he got hurt.
Whack. The new players, Sprewell and Camby, stumbled about as a
team so accustomed to playing one way shifted suddenly to another.
Whack. At 21-21, facing exclusion from the playoffs, Dave Checketts
decided he needed to find an organizational sacrifice before the
television moguls began blaming him. Whack.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to anticipate the startling results since the
``reassigning'' of Grunfeld _ 23 games played, 17 won. The critics
should stop apologizing for reporting what they legitimately saw, a
team that was succumbing more to its own dysfunction than the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought this a year ago, even two months ago?''
DeBusschere said. ``Not a soul would've suggested they'd get to the
finals. And I'll tell you the guy that surprises me more than
anyone is L.J. I thought he was done.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, of course, may be done as an effective contributor, if
the sprained ligament in his right knee does not heal fast. There
are alternate interpretations of what this latest Knick injury
could mean.
</P>
<P>
   One, it leaves them without a low-post presence that will enable
Tim Duncan and David Robinson to roam with impunity, assist with
the defense against Houston and Sprewell, the Knicks' go-to
scorers. Two, it gives the Knicks one more victim to play and win
for, as this television event, this unlikely epic, enters its final
round.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman, who died of leukemia, seven months too soon. Ewing,
reduced to a cheerleader in his 14th year in pursuit of a ring.
Grunfeld, watching bitterly from home. Pick your persecution. They
have all been whacked, but, beware Spurs: These Knicks are way
beyond ``Why me?'' &QL;

4 EUROPEAN NATIONS CURB COCA-COLA DRINKS DUE TO ILLNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the biggest recall in Coke history, the governments of
France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have ordered
products from Coca-Cola Co., off their shelves after dozens of
people who drank the soft drinks became ill.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes on the heels of a health scare over food
contaminated with dioxin that began in Belgium and spread across
Europe. On Sunday, the reverberations from the dioxin scare led to
the resignation of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium on Monday ordered Coke to remove all its soft drinks in
bottles and cans from stores. Luxembourg followed suit Tuesday.
France told Coca-Cola to stop shipping cans and bottles from a
plant in Dunkirk, near the Belgian border, where some of the
contaminated Cokes originated, and the Netherlands banned all Coke
products coming from Belgium. France has also informed Coke that it
will ask for a recall Wednesday of all canned Coke products already
shipped from the Dunkirk plant.
</P>
<P>
   The recall, which affects less than 1 percent of Coke's global
sales, is another public blow for Coca-Cola, which last year sold
$18.8 billion worth of soft drinks around the world but has been
struggling with declining volume in many regions. In Europe, Coke's
efforts to buy competing brands like Schweppes and Orangina have
hit hurdles repeatedly over the last nine months amid regulatory
concerns about market domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like there's a curse over the continent when it comes to
Coke right now,'' said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage stock analyst
for Salomon Smith Barney. ``It's puzzling, and it's unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Coca-Cola executives said that problems
along two points in its vast bottling system, which is controlled
in Belgium by Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coke's largest bottler, led to
defects in its products.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, 31 middle-school students complained of a bad
taste and later became sick with nausea and vomiting after drinking
Coke from glass bottles that had been filled at a plant in Antwerp.
The students, who attended a school in Bornem, were drinking Coke
in part because of a contest in which points were printed
underneath bottle caps. The points can be redeemed for prizes. As
many as eight students remained hospitalized Tuesday, The
Associated Press reported, although a Coke spokesman said he was
not aware that anyone was still hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Those soft drinks, the statement said, had been bottled using
carbon dioxide that was defective and that caused ``an off-taste in
the bottled product.'' The company said all bottles produced with
the defective carbon dioxide, which creates the bubbles in a
carbonated soft drink, had been recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But the company insisted that the products were safe to drink.
``This issue affects the taste of the soft drinks only,'' it said
in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that one person showed symptoms of
hemolysis, in which red blood cells are destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   A second problem arose Thursday, when people complained of
nausea after drinking cans of Coke products bought from vending
machines. The cans smelled bad on the outside, and people who
opened them and drank the contents became ill. ``Everything inside
the can was okay, but there was a package-integrity issue,'' said a
Coca-Cola spokesman, Rob Baskin. That problem, with reports
continuing as recently as Monday, was traced Tuesday to wooden
pallets used to ship the cans.
</P>
<P>
   The cans came from a plant in Dunkirk, France, but the problem
pallets are used only in Belgium, Baskin said. The wood had been
treated with a substance that transmitted what the company called
``an offensive odor on the outside bottom of the can.'' The
complaints came from several places around Belgium, including
Korttrijk, a city in the southwest, Baskin said. Again, the
Coca-Cola statement said, ``the product is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain why people became sick if the soft drinks were
safe, he said: ``It may make you feel sick, but it is not
harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola executives are scheduled to meet with the Belgian
health ministry Wednesday to discuss their findings and to ask for
approval to resume selling Coke products in Belgium. Belgian
television news Tuesday night carried footage of store owners
clearing Coke products from their shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time in recent memory that we have been asked
to withdraw products from an entire marketplace,'' Baskin said. The
recall in Belgium and Luxembourg affects all products sold by Coke,
including Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Light, Sprite, Fanta, Nestea,
Aquarius sports drinks and Bon Aqua water. Some of those products
are affected by the recall in France and the Netherlands, although
Baskin said he did not know which were produced at the Dunkirk
plant or handled for other markets through Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's share price fell $1.063 Tuesday, to finish the day
at $63.75. Coca-Cola Enterprises lost $1.063, closing at $34.188.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium has long been an important market for Coke and Coca-Cola
Enterprises. The most recent Coca-Cola Enterprises annual report,
which devotes an entire page to the company's operations in
Belgium, says that Belgians are among the most enthusiastic Coke
drinkers in Europe. ``Today, per capita consumption is 260, among
the highest in Europe,'' it said. That measure, the number of
eight-ounce servings consumed per person per year, is nearly three
times that of France, at 96, and well ahead of Germany, at 200.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bellas, chief executive officer of Beverage Marketing, a
trade group in Manhattan, said, ``They have a wonderful track
record, but this has got to hurt a little bit.'' Coca-Cola's market
share in Belgium, he added, is 68 percent, well ahead of the No. 2,
Cadbury Schweppes, which has a 4 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Coca-Cola has had its plans to acquire the
Orangina brand from Pernod Ricard SA rejected by the French
government and an appeals court, although Coke is trying to
structure the deal in a way to win approval. And after encountering
stiff resistance from the European Union as well as individual
countries, Coke scaled-back plans announced in December to buy the
Cadbury Schweppes PLC brands outside the United States, with the
exception of France and South Africa. What had been a $1.85 billion
deal was trimmed to $1.1 billion, and now excludes most of the
European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
   Beverage industry stock analysts said Coke would have to move
quickly to control any public-relations damage stemming from the
recall. ``The key issue is quickly resolving this and aggressively
communicating to the consumer that safe products are going back on
the shelf,'' said Bill Pecoriello, a beverage analyst for Sanford
C. Bernstein, adding that he thought there would be little impact
on earnings at Coke unless the problem dragged on through the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian authorities have been dealing with the dioxin scare, in
which the cancer-causing chemical was found in animal feed in
recent months. The discovery led to a ban on poultry, pork, beef,
eggs and meat products, both within Belgium and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   While different substances are involved, the Coke recall
lengthens the list of groceries that have lost some of their
luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had kids at the Coca-Cola drinking stage, I would be
telling them not to drink it out of the can anymore,'' said Steve
Ketele, a retired journalist who lives outside Brussels. ``But
thank God, they are in the wine-drinking stage.''

 &HT;    On first day of camp, RB Dillon not his usual self
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Even though the Cincinnati Bengals open their
locker room to the media on a regular basis, Corey Dillon has
seldom made himself available.
</P>
<P>
   During the time he was supposed to be available, he either
declared himself off limits to reporters or hid out in the
players-only training room.
</P>
<P>
   But on the first day of a voluntary three-day minicamp that
began at Spinney Field on Tuesday, the running back never displayed
the aloofness and surliness that had been his trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon said his new mellowness and changed outlook began in
February when Desiree Antoine, his fiance, gave birth to a
daughter, Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor lasted 28 hours and I was there for all of it,''
Dillon said. ``I thought I was strong until I saw what Desiree went
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon described the baby's birth as ``the most beautiful
experience I've ever dealt with. I can't really describe it, but
now that I'm responsible for her, I just feel more mellow, more
complete, more calm. Every time I look at her, I feel like I'm on
top of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon did not join the 50-plus veterans who have been working
out at Spinney in recent weeks, but said he had other obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't because I didn't want to be here,'' he said. ``She
(Desiree) was going to school and I stayed home to take care of the
baby. I thought I was doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon is the only running back in Bengal history to start his
career with back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. Last year, however, he
was limited by a series of nagging injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had problems with my shoulder, knee, ribs, back and ankle.
There always seemed to be something wrong. I had hoped to do a lot
more, so in that respect it wasn't a year I will cherish. It was an
OK year, an average year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though this minicamp is voluntary, 81 rookies and veterans
under contract are participating. The only invited player who
failed to make an appearance on Tuesday was 10-year man James
Francis, listed No. 2 on the depth chart at left outside linebacker
behind Steve Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bruce Coslet was obviously displeased with Francis'
decision and there's a good chance he won't be invited to training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``James chose not to be here and everyone else did,'' Coslet
said. ``That speaks volumes and we'll go on from there. Let's talk

BUSH `A REGULAR SORT OF GUY' IN NEW HAMPSHIRE  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DERRY, N.H. _ Wearing a blue windbreaker with the state seal on
one breast and his name on the other, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
stepped off his campaign bus Tuesday at Hadco Industries, one of
the final stops on his maiden foray outside Texas as a presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush glanced toward the four suited company officials standing
at the head of the sidewalk. Behind them, a gantlet of 14
television cameras and too many newspaper photographers and
reporters to count, waiting to record his every word, every move in
the 25-yard walk into the plant.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush did not follow the script, which campaign officials
acknowledge designing to avoid missteps that might break the string
of glowing reviews of his four-day campaign trip. Instead, he
angled toward a tree-shaded picnic table where five Hadco workers
had paused for a smoke before going inside to help make circuit
boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you don't mind me and 250 of my new best friends
joining you,'' Bush said with a laugh as the media scrum
immediately surrounded the table, pointing cameras from every
direction and dangling fuzzy boom microphones close overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, he was off, headed toward the plant entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Like the thousands encountering Bush in Iowa and New Hampshire
since Saturday, the five workers were awed, as much by the
spectacle of the entourage as the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, the way he sat down and talked to us, he's a
regular sort of guy,'' said Bill Brown, a maintenance worker. ``He
seems to have a sense of humor. And looks a lot like his dad
(former President Bush). And that's good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess down the road we're going to learn what he stands
for,'' Brown added, drawing nods from his co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, generally an unknown quantity outside Texas except for the
name, arrived in New Hampshire as a new public opinion survey found
him with more support among Granite State Republicans than all 10
of his GOP rival combined.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by American Research Group also showed that 74
percent of New Hampshire Republicans have a favorable opinion of
Bush, and 2 percent have an unfavorable opinion, making him by the
far the most popular of the GOP presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   His closest rival, Elizabeth Dole, was favored by 15 percent of
New Hampshire Republicans, down from 25 percent in February, the
poll showed. It also found Dole was viewed favorably by 64 percent
of state GOP voters; unfavorably by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite plans to avoid specifics until the fall so opponents
will have less to shoot at, Bush provided an outline of a few
positions during his trip to the two key states in the presidential
nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supports a constitutional ban on flag burning and opposes
using abortion opposition as a litmus test for Supreme Court
appointments. He wants to increase spending on the military. At the
same time, he promises to veto any effort to raise income tax rates
but would not rule out other tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old candidate opposes quotas and racial preferences,
but wants to increase minority access to higher education and
government contracts. In Iowa, a major corn-producing state, Bush
endorsed subsidies for ethanol production, which relies on corn for
making the alternative fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also favors medical savings accounts _ a program that
allows people to deduct money before taxes to pay health care
bills. Asked about tougher gun controls, Bush sidestepped a direct
answer, saying he defends the right to bear arms and officials
``need to enforce the laws on the books.''
</P>
<P>
   Other specifics _ such as how he plans to boost military
preparedness and cut taxes _ would be forthcoming, he said,
acknowledging that he broke little new ground on issues. ``There's
going to be a lot of time for 10-point programs,'' he said, adding
that he would offer detailed proposals ``on my own timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   The likely Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore, took a
sideways swipe at Bush as he flew to Tennessee for his own
announcement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to just deal in platitudes,'' he said. ``I'm
going to deal with policies and specific choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, asked on CNN about Gore's entry into the race, was
unimpressed. ``He's the status quo,'' Bush said. ``If people like
the status quo, then the rest of the country can come fishing with
me in Texas next year.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush's GOP opponents, the details cannot come soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually he's going to have to walk into the living rooms
and the diners, on to a stage where (Bush's aides) don't have total
control of the environment,'' said Tom Rath, the New Hampshire
campaign coordinator for Lamar Alexander. ``That's when any
weakness will show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now we've been competing, not against George W. Bush the
man, but against a mythology,'' Rath said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to draw him out, two of his more conservative Republican
opponents _ Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes _ have challenged him to a
series of debates. His staff dismisses the invitations as coming
too early.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democratic operatives have begun trailing him,
characterizing him as an extremist disguising himself as a
moderate. At several stops, national Democratic Party Chairman Joe
Andrew reminded reporters that Bush is from the same state that
elected House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Irving and Majority
Whip Tom DeLay of Sugar Land, two conservative congressmen who take
credit _ and share the blame _ for partisan congressional politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took the tactics in stride. ``I'm pleased the Democrats are
paying attention,'' he said. ``I like to talk about me, and I'm
glad that others are talking about me too. They must be worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving New Hampshire, Bush stopped at the Madden Family
Restaurant in Derry, where he slipped behind the counter to help
serve coffee before speaking to supporters who packed the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Otto, a customer, said he supports Bush even though he did
not learn anything new about the Texas governor except that ``he
pours a good cup of coffee.''

GIULIANI SEEKS CHARTER CHANGE TO THWART FOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has not yet announced he is
even running for the Senate, but already he is plotting to block
one of his foes from succeeding him in City Hall should he win the
race and move to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For months now, Giuliani and his aides have gritted their teeth
over what they see as the one downside of his running for national
office _ that he might have to turn over the city's reins to Mark
Green.
</P>
<P>
   Green, a liberal Democrat who has unsuccessfully run for mayor
and senator, is New York City's popularly elected public advocate
and, as such, has written many reports criticizing Giuliani's
policies. The two men stand yards apart ideologically, and do not
like each other personally.
</P>
<P>
   The next mayoral election is scheduled for November 2001 _ one
year after Giuliani is expected to run for Senate. The city charter
designates the public advocate as next in line in case the mayor
leaves office prematurely. Therefore, if Giuliani wins the Senate
race, Green would become acting mayor for a year _ and, given the
advantages of incumbency, would stand a good chance of winning the
job for a full four-year term beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   So, Tuesday, Giuliani named a 15-member special commission _
dominated by his close political allies _ to revise the city
charter.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani reportedly would like to keep the public advocate as
his successor, but only for 60 days, and then to hold a special
election.
</P>
<P>
   Any proposals made by the charter commission would be placed on
a ballot and voted upon, as a referendum, as early as November.
</P>
<P>
   Green called a press conference Tuesday, a few hours after the
mayor named his panel, to denounce the move as ``a vindictive power
grab,'' a ``clear abuse of power,'' and another sign that Giuliani
``governs by tantrum and vendetta.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made no bones about the political nature of his action.
``This is politics,'' he told reporters. ``That's what I do. I'm
the mayor . . . and the city charter gives the mayor certain
powers, which I exercise.'' He also said his views of Green are
well known, adding for those who remain in the dark that a Green
mayoralty would be ``a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, at his news conference, released a scholarly report
showing that the current rules of mayoral succession are consistent
with 167 years of tradition, and have survived six major revisions
of the charter, including the last one, 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The position of public advocate has been around only since 1993,
but it is the explicit successor to a former office called
president of the City Council and, before that, president of the
Board of Aldermen. And all of those positions, Green said, have
been designated as the one that should step up to acting mayor in
case of a vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he would join with major civic groups to campaign
against a charter revision. ``It's a fight we won't lose,'' he
said. ``The public will understand that it's simply wrong to change
the rules during the game _ wrong to move the fences in the 9th
inning because your team is losing.''
</P>
<P>
   The spice in this fight is that quite a few Democrats, including
many who have no fondness for Giuliani, will refrain from joining
Green's side.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hevesi, a Democrat and the city comptroller, has said he
would support a change to the charter. Hevesi very much would like
to be mayor himself, and would rather run for an open seat than
have to unseat an incumbent, even one who has been in office for
only a year and who was put there under strange circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi, who has explicitly aligned himself with many of
Giuliani's policies and approaches to governing, is widely thought
to be the mayor's preferred successor.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Vallone, another Democrat, who is the speaker of the City
Council and also a prospective mayoral candidate, agrees that the
succession rules should be changed, though he agrees with Green
that it is wrong to change the rules just because of the
personalities involved. His spokesman, Mike Clendinin, summarized
his stance Tuesday in significantly neutral fashion: ``It's a
legitimate issue for debate.''

PANEL SEEKS TOUGHER TEACHER RECERTIFICATION STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE AND DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Conceding that a six-year old effort to improve
teacher quality has failed, Massachusetts officials plan to toughen
the requirements for educators when they renew their certification
every five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Commission on Educator Preparation is proposing to
eliminate a controversial provision of the Education Reform Act
that requires recertifying teachers to complete 120 hours of
professional development courses. Some of those courses have been
dismissed even by supporters of reform as ``Mickey Mouse'' and a
waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers would still have to take courses to renew
certification. But the new plan shifts the focus from how many
hours teachers spend to the quality of programs.
</P>
<P>
   When the recertification provision was established with the
reform act in 1993, the state required only that teachers take
courses registered with the department of education. In one
celebrated fiasco, the department allowed teachers to sign up for a
professional development cruise aboard a luxury liner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are many programs that are taken simply for
convenience, for getting the seat time,'' said the state's
Chancellor of Higher Education Stanley Z. Koplik. ``In the past,
anybody has been able to offer programs and call it teacher
preparation. What we want now is some quality control. The emphasis
is on quality, not quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new proposal, the number of course hours would be
reduced, but teachers could take only those courses that had been
examined and approved by the department, which would set specific
quality standards. School principals or superintendents would also
have to approve the courses, to make sure they are relevant and
meet the school's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gorrie, president of the state's largest teacher's union
said Tuesday the majority of teachers choose high quality courses
and ``another layer of bureaucracy'' is unnecessary to ensure that.
He also said if the proposal is approved by the state Board of
Education, money should be part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some districts are strapped financially and even though they
get a bit of money for the programs, it's not always enough,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Gorrie agreed that higher quality programs are a good
idea, he warned that ``miring'' the process in ``approval details''
will not get anything accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   The recertification requirement came under fire almost as soon
as it was passed. But the complaints have increased over the past
year as the five year deadline has come closer. More than 65,000
educators must complete their recertification this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, nine veteran teachers filed a lawsuit challenging the
requirement, and arguing that the ``lifetime'' certification they
earned when they began working should be honored. If an injunction
is not granted by a judge this week, they could lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The change proposed by the commission, made up of members of the
state boards of education and higher education, would not address
the main complaint of the lawsuit _ that teachers shouldn't have to
renew their certification at all. But it would eliminate some of
the chief complaints about recertification by making the programs
more relevant to reform.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also did not address whether the required number
of professional development points would increase or decrease.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Peyser, chairman of the state Board of Education, said
professional development programs offered by providers in the
future must focus on content knowledge for specific certifications,
and noted that greater emphasis should be placed on advanced
studies of topics.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that teachers should take courses on their own, not
just to satisfy recertification requirements, but to enrich
themselves as educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professional development does not exclusively and should not
exclusively be connected to points,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal made Tuesday would also require teachers to take
professional development courses in three of the five years in the
recertification cycle. Now, Koplik said, many teachers wait until
the last year before they begin taking courses, so end up taking
what is available, rather than what will improve their teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Educators would have to show how the courses they take are
linked to individual improvement, or to the improvement goals of
their school or district, and demonstrate that the courses they
have taken have improved their teaching, either through test scores
or evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal must be approved by the state board of education.
But as three members of the commission that made the proposal are
on the board, as is Koplik, it is expected to win easy approval.

   France: Conservatives in Turmoil
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac's conservative party Rally for the
Republic is looking for a new leader for the second time in two
months, after the resignation of Nicolas Sarkozy, who led it to a
disastrous 12.71 percent showing in Sunday's European Parliament
elections. Sarkozy took over temporarily in April after his
predecessor, Philippe Seguin, quit after a disagreement with
Chirac. A former Gaullist ally of Chirac's, Charles Pasqua, won 13
percent of the French vote with a new party of his own.

<P>
   Fresh from their first electoral success since losing office two
years ago, the Conservatives made sweeping changes in their top
leadership, firing the deputy leader, Peter Lilley, and replacing
most of the holdover members of the government of Prime Minister
John Major. The new team reflects the uncompromising anti-euro
position of the party leader, William Hague, that was credited with
the Conservative success in winning 36 of the 87 British seats in
the European Parliament, compared with 29 won by Labor.

SENATE SUPPORTS BILL LIMITING Y2K LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ariz., S.C.)  (Eds: See also SILICON-REPUBS) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of partisan squabbling, the Senate
approved legislation Tuesday that would limit lawsuits arising from
Year 2000 computer failures.
</P>
<P>
   But the 62-37 vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed
to override President Clinton's promised veto. That means further
negotiations with the White House will be needed for the measure to
become law, as is considered likely.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would place a ceiling of $250,000 on the punitive
damages that could be assessed against companies with fewer than 50
employees, and would give all companies 90 days to solve Year 2000
computer problems before they could be held liable.
</P>
<P>
   The debate coincided with a three-day ``high-tech summit'' on
Capitol Hill, in which Republicans are eagerly trying to win
friends in Silicon Valley by pressing the case for getting the
government off the Valley's back.
</P>
<P>
   Most important for the large and wealthy computer companies, the
legislation specifies that all the companies responsible for a
computer failure would share the legal liability and that no
company could be assessed damages greater than its proportional
responsibility for a breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   This would prevent a wealthy company like Microsoft that was
marginally at fault from bearing all the damages when smaller
companies with fewer resources were mostly responsible for a
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   What is called the Y2K problem results from the reliance of some
computers on programs that use only the last two digits of years.
Those that are not properly updated could misinterpret the year
2000 as 1900, causing the computers and electronically controlled
machinery to fail.
</P>
<P>
   While the specific legislation involves computers and the Year
2000, the underlying politics reflects the longstanding division
between business interests, which are the largest financial
supporters of Republicans in Congress, and trial lawyers, who are
among the biggest Democratic donors.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are also fishing for political support from the
ocean of money in high-technology companies. Democrats, torn by the
conflicting claims of trial lawyers and cyberspace magnates,
insisted Tuesday that legislation would soon be enacted to protect
the computer companies from unnecessary litigation.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans, at the ``high-tech summit,'' had
nothing but praise for the chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates, and
other computer luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Business lobbies like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the
National Association of Manufacturers have spent millions lobbying
and advertising for the legislation. The chamber made the issue the
organization's biggest legislative priority of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, big technology companies like Intel and Compaq, as
well as small ones from Silicon Valley, worked for the measure. ``I
cannot tell you the depth of passion that the high-tech industry
feels for the bill in California,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., one of 12 Democrats who joined 50 Republicans in voting
for the bill. Voting against it were four Republicans and 33
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing it, along with the trial lawyers, were many
organizations representing consumers, like the Consumer Federation
of America and Public Citizen.
</P>
<P>
   In the final debate, both sides painted horrific pictures of
what would happen if they did not get their way.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chief sponsor of the bill, said
its purpose was to prevent ``an avalanche of frivolous lawsuits''
that could ``stymie the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Litigation has become big business for a segment of the trial
bar,'' he declared. ``That small group is eagerly anticipating the
bonanza that Y2K problems present in litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Without restraints, McCain said, ``the legal costs associated
with Y2K will exceed that of asbestos, breast implants, tobacco and
Superfund combined.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the opponents was Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who was
a trial lawyer before going into politics and who has long been the
lawyers' champion in the Senate. ``We're now going to legalize
fraud,'' he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This town loves lawyers _ office lawyers,'' said Hollings, 77,
one of the few remaining senators who always speaks
extemporaneously, as old-timers did, rather than reading his floor
speeches. But Republicans, he added, have made a political sport
out of demonizing ``working lawyers _ trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, in the United States, business sets the
standard for safe products, and the reason is fear of lawsuits over
faulty products.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved a similar bill last month, 236-190, also well
shy of a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   Now, representatives of the White House are likely to join
negotiators from the Senate and House in the conference committee
to work out the differences between the Senate and House versions
of the legislation. A bill is likely to emerge before long,
lawmakers said, that will satisfy most of Clinton's objections.
</P>
<P>
   Among those objections are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hurdles intended to prevent frivolous lawsuits by companies
would also apply to individuals, making it more difficult, for
instance, for a person to collect legitimate damages if his house
were burgled after a computer problem caused his alarm system to
fail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Class-action suits would be forced into federal courts, where
the rules are generally more favorable to defendants than they are
in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   _ The proportional liability requirement could be burdensome to
plaintiffs who could not afford multiple lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, McCain seemed prepared to make concessions. ``We
will do what we can to avoid a presidential veto of this important
legislation,'' he said.

SEATTLE ART MUSEUM RETURNING MATISSE PIECE STOLEN BY NAZIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Seattle Art Museum on Monday agreed to return a
Henri Matisse painting to the heirs of Paul Rosenberg, a Jewish art
dealer whose collection was stolen in France by the Nazis during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The museum board unanimously approved the decision Monday, more
than two years after the Rosenbergs claimed ownership of the 1927
oil painting titled ``Odalisque.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Elaine Rosenberg, widow of Paul Rosenberg's son,
Alexandre, and her sister-in-law, Rosenberg's daughter Micheline
Nanette Sinclair, expressed frustration last year that the museum
was taking so long to make a decision, they said through their New
York attorney Laura Hoguet they were happy with the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm entirely sympathetic with the Rosenbergs,'' said Mimi
Gates, SAM's director. ``But we had a responsibility to undertake
thorough and exhaustive research into the painting's ownership
history.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the museum had to be sure its Matisse, valued at more
than $2 million, was the one stolen and it had never been returned
to or sold by a Rosenberg heir.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said from the beginning we'd do the right thing, and that's
what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum had research conducted by its curatorial staff,
independent French scholars and the Holocaust Art Restitution
Project (HARP) in Washington, D.C., which was created by the B'nai
B'rith Klutznick National Jewish Museum to form a database and
investigate Jewish cultural losses. All evidence, said Gates,
points to the legitimacy of the Rosenbergs' claim. ``Once that was
determined, we acted quickly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   SAM was the first U.S. museum sued for restitution of artwork
lost through German looting during World War II. Last year, the
Chicago Art Institute was involved in a similar case, but the work
in question - a Degas pastel landscape - was only a promised gift
and was owned by drug company heir Daniel C. Searle.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted by the claims of the heirs of Friedrich and
Louise Gutmann, both murdered by the Germans during the war, Searle
said he refused to be extorted. Last August, on the eve of going to
court, Searle settled, ceding half interest in the landscape to the
Gutmann heirs and half to the Art Institute, which acquired the
Degas by paying the Gutmanns half of the its value.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said the Rosenbergs expressed no interest in working out a
deal to let the painting stay in Seattle. ``They wanted their
painting back,'' she said. ``We're honoring that.'' The museum now
owns one painting, two prints and a sculpture by Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Vineberg, director of the American Jewish Committee of
Greater Seattle, praised the museum for its ``precedent-setting act
of moral courage that will go a long way in helping to resolve
future and pending cases in the United States involving artwork
stolen by the Nazis during World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle collector Prentice Bloedel bought the painting in 1954
from New York's Knoedler Gallery and hung it in his living room
until it was donated after his death to the Seattle Art Museum in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The location of ``Odalisqaue'' came to light after it was
reproduced as ``whereabouts unknown'' in Hector Feliciano's 1995
book, ``The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's
Greatest Works of Art.'' Bloedel's grandson, the New York artist
Bing Wright, saw the painting in Feliciano's book and notified the
Rosenbergs.
</P>
<P>
   Art collector and museum trustee Virginia Wright, daughter of
the late Prentice Bloedel, said Monday that she's glad the issue is
resolved. She said she's sure the return of the painting will
create no tax problems for her parents' estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum is doing absolutely the right thing,'' she said.
``My parents would have hated the publicity, but I'm sure they
would be in favor of returning the Matisse to the rightful
owners.'' She said her parents couldn't have known about the
painting's real history. ``When they bought it, the Knoedler
Gallery had a great reputation. In those days, if you went to a
reputable gallery, you assumed the gallery would stand by its
material.''
</P>
<P>
   SAM attorney Stuart Dunwoody said the museum will continue its
suit against the Knoedler Gallery for ``lying about the painting's
provenance and breach of warranty.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is slated for trial in Seattle Jan. 3, but Dunwoody
said he intends to file a motion for summary judgment against
Knoedler in the fall. Lewis Clayton, attorney for Knoedler, said in
response that he doesn't think the museum has a viable claim
against his client.

   DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ The Serbs' most brutal force in their
campaign to drive out the ethnic Albanian majority from Kosovo fell
on this city and a swath of villages around it in the shadow of the
Accursed Mountains. On Tuesday, in a landscape of gravesites,
burned homes, toppled mosque minarets and smashed shops, it became
clear just how ferocious that campaign had been.
</P>
<P>
   As German soldiers in the NATO force secured the highway running
northwest from Prizren and Italian troops moved here southeast from
Pec, foreign journalists were allowed into the area for the first
time since the Serbian drive began in late March. What they found
confirmed _ often with uncanny precision _ were refugees' widely
reported accounts. But the actual sight was nonetheless shocking.
</P>
<P>
   Suspected mass graves were located by NATO officials Tuesday on
the sites of previously reported massacres in Velika Krusa (called
Krush-e-Mahde in Albanian) and Bella Crkva. Residents told
reporters of other gravesites, and it seemed certain that many
additional sites would be found.
</P>
<P>
   All along the highway and up back roads, farmhouses,
particularly substantial ones, were charred and broken.
</P>
<P>
   In Djakovica, the Old Town, a picturesque Ottoman-era
marketplace was gutted, the shops nothing but a jumble of fragments
of orange roof tiles. Bullet holes were everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few clumps of people walked the ruined streets of
Djakovica, most for the first time in two and a half months. For
they had been hiding, ducking through holes knocked in the walls of
interconnecting houses and gardens to escape Serbian raids. Tens of
thousand of residents fled in the first few days of burning and
killing.
</P>
<P>
   But the relief was tempered with fear.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 men had been taken away by the Serbs, residents
said, often breaking into tears as they approached foreign
reporters in hopes of finding information, and no one knows what
happened to them.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons the Serbs were so harsh here. Almost
entirely Albanian, Djakovica has long been a center of Albanian
nationalism. The whole region, known as Has on both sides of the
border, is regarded by the interrelated Albanian clans as one
entity.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army bases are on the other side of the
craggy mountains, in lawless northern Albania, and their supply
routes run down the mountain passes into the valleys here. Thus the
town has enormous strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
   Tactically, the area lies on a main highway close to the border.
In the Serbs' well-planned and organized campaign, mass killings in
the first days spread terror, emptying villages near the borders,
encouraging others to follow on the routes now cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Until NATO began its security operations on Saturday, more than
900,000 Albanians had fled over the borders, and an additional
500,000 were driven from their houses, living in forests and
mountains, the alliance said.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of the Serb's atrocities was spread across the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   In Mala Krusa (Krush-e-Vogel to the Albanian-speaking
villagers), northwest of the southern city of Prizren, a farmhouse
with 21 bodies on the bottom floor was secured by NATO peacekeepers
on Tuesday morning. The bodies _ 15 in one room and six in another
_ were badly burned, witnesses said, and just one skeleton appeared
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Bullet holes pocked the outside walls in a yard-high ring around
the house. At least one body belonged to a child, and another to a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Across the main road, in Velika Krusa, German forces inspected a
patch of churned earth, perhaps 10 yards by 20 yards, next to a
small cemetery. The grave was pointed out by Kosovo Liberation Army
soldiers, who said up to 100 people were buried there after a
massacre in late March.
</P>
<P>
   To the northwest several miles, in Bela Crkva, villagers pointed
out seven sites where they said 64 people were killed in a massacre
early in the morning on March 25, the day after NATO began bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nazmi is here,'' said Teki Zhuniqi, 41, a villager who helped
bury the bodies after the Serb police had left the town.
</P>
<P>
   Zhuniqi pointed slightly to the right and added: ``Nesim is
here. They are brothers. Shundeti is here, then Agon. Then it's
Etem and Etem's son. I don't know his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The youngest was 14. The oldest was 82, in this grave here.''
</P>
<P>
   He stood at the site where he said villagers _ working at night
using small flashlights hidden under their jackets so that the
Serbs would not spot them _ buried 39 men three days after the
massacre. Over two nights the villagers buried 62 people in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, wounded in the massacre, died later at another
village, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhuniqi and other witnesses who had been interviewed earlier in
Albania said the Serb police and soldiers stormed the town with
tanks and artillery at 3 a.m. after the bombing started. The
villagers fled to a stream next to a railway bridge. Zhuniqi said
the soldiers followed stragglers to the stream, separated the men
from the women and began firing. Thirty-nine men died next to the
stream as Zhuniqi and 12 others hid in a wheat field 150 yards
away.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hill of dead bodies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An additional six men, including the local Muslim clergyman,
fled into a ditch several hundred yards down the railroad tracks
but were found and are now buried there.
</P>
<P>
   An additonal 12 people _ seven children, four women and two men
_ died on a slope further down the stream.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, near that grave, Zhuniqi and a friend, Xhafer Gashi,
41, picked through the children's pink snow boots, a child's
colorful shirt and a baby's bottle, still full. There was one
survivor, a 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came at midnight,'' Zhuniqi recounted, ``he was
between his mother and father. He was crying. How can there be
anything more evil than this? Sometimes I can't sleep because I saw
so many dead bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the town itself, villagers said, they buried three people _
one man in a wheelchair and his wife, and another man missing a leg
_ who could not run when the Serbs attacked. On Tuesday, villagers
uncovered the remains of one man, burned and wrapped in a plastic
bag, at the request of a foreign television crew.
</P>
<P>
   Gashi said he could not believe the Serbs' explanation that the
war began merely to search out and destroy the guerrillas. Simply
too much was destroyed, too many civilians killed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bela Crkva, where 300 families lived, nearly every house
needs to be completely rebuilt. The mosque was bombed, its 81-foot
minaret crumbled in a heap in the front. Dogs and livestock rot
where they were shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That dead cow was not in the KLA,'' Gashi said.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists roaming through the area found Albanians offering to
lead them to other, less well-known death sites. In Guske, east of
Djakovica, Mark Kqiraj, 32, led the way up a long dirt road up to
his family's spacious farm, which had been used as a Serb barracks,
then along a path to a mound of freshly turned earth he said held
the bodies of 11 of his relatives. In Koronice, villagers showed
the skeletons of five people killed in a house.
</P>
<P>
   In a cemetery on the edge of Djakovica are about 150 hastily dug
graves marked by sticks or wooden stakes _ some marked not with a
name, but only a village _ where people tried to give a proper
burial to what villagers said were victims of the Serbs dug up from
mass graves or found on the street. Some of the graves have no
marker.
</P>
<P>
   In Djakovica itself, nearly all the stores were smashed and
houses burned throughout the city, but the heaviest damage was in
the narrow, cobblestone streets of the traditional marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the old part _ antique _ all the stores were filled
with things,'' said Pranvera Daija, pushing a baby carriage on the
street for the first time since March. `'This was the most
beautiful part of all.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a ruin, now, with every shop gutted and the very top of
the central mosque's minaret, where the muezzin calls to prayer,
collapsed, people said, by an exceedingly accurate rocket-propelled
grenade. As in Bosnia, the cultural artifacts of the Ottoman empire
_ even the beautiful bridges and architecture _were particular
targets for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the first night, this place was burned,'' Petrit Daija, her
husband, said, beginning the story, told by both refugees and those
who remained of how the Serbs had swept from neighborhood to
neighborhood, killing, looting and burning.
</P>
<P>
   Like others who managed to stay, Mrs. Daija said, they kept
constantly on the alert and escaped ``from one house to another
through holes we made in the walls.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Linditi Rudi, also pushing a baby carraige, put in,
``and by keeping our children's mouths shut like this,'' clamping
her hand over her lips.
</P>
<P>
   The house where Hani Hoxha's family was killed was exactly as
the old man had described it to a reporter in Albania weeks ago,
except of course, the walls were now scorched and tumbled where the
Serbs had burned it down, the car they had put in front of the gate
in a futile attempt to block the entrance was rusted out and the
yard was overgrown with weeds and shaggy roses.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, in a cafe in the Albanian capital Tirana, called
Snow White, after the mountaintops here, not the fairytale
princess, Hoxha had taken this reporter's notebook and
painstakingly diagrammed the family compound where they had sought
refuge, and the places where 18 people were slaughtered by the
Serbs while he listened in hiding, wedged between two buildings.
</P>
<P>
   It was all there. In the corner was the pool hall, so riddled
with automatic weapons fire that a corner of the pool table was
chewed off, and the charred basement underneath where a dozen
people had been sleeping and were slain. There was the car, an old
Zastava, plate DJ-295-90, still parked fruitlessly in front of the
gate.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the burned-out building where his wife, two
daughters and a six-year-old granddaughter were executed, just as
he had so carefully drawn.
</P>
<P>
   The Carrapatok neighborhood around his house was almost
completely empty, its shops closed with only a few cats wandering
the streets. But on a side street a few blocks away were perhaps
the last victims here of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, Nazmi Haqibeqiri, 57, went to have coffee as
was his habit with his elderly neighbors, Nreke Nushi and his wife,
Marije. He found their bodies, each with five bullets, on the
bloody floor of the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Nushi, he said, had been forced by the Serbs to build fake
bridges out of pine boards and plastic sheeting in hopes of fooling
the NATO bombers, in his little odd-jobs factory behind his house.
Because of the factory, he said, it appeared Serb soldiers thought
he must have money and tried to rob him.
</P>
<P>
   Haqibeqiri called the police, still controlled by the Serbs,
twice to report the crime but nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said just take the bodies and bury them,'' he said.

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The Yugoslav military largely complied
with NATO's demands to leave much of Kosovo by midnight Tuesday,
with thousands of soldiers involved in President Slobodan
Milosevic's war here for more than a year withdrawing on tanks,
trucks and tractors.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said that Yugoslavia's Serb-dominated army and
interior police had, so far, withdrawn nearly half of the 40,000
troops who had been amassed in Kosovo at the height of the
conflict. The troops included 12,000 in a region from Djakovica to
Gnjilane to Pristina that NATO had said on June 9 would be required
to pull out within six days after Yugoslav generals accepted terms
for ending the allied air war. The officials said the withdrawal
had accelerated in the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   With the withdrawals, NATO extended its control over nearly a
third of Kosovo, but tensions remained and security was by no means
certain.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops have had few confrontations with retreating Yugoslav
forces, but on Tuesday British paratroopers arrested five members
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the Kosovo Albanian rebel group, who
were accused of shooting and killing a Serb in a town near the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the rebels has become particularly nettlesome
for NATO. Although the terms for ending the war called on the
rebels to disband, NATO has done little to stop its members from
taking on more and more trappings of official power. That has
prompted many of Kosovo's Serbian residents to flee along with the
withdrawing troops.
</P>
<P>
   Across the province, Yugoslav army troops were on the move
Tuesday in enormous, bedraggled, but evidently organized convoys.
By afternoon, they abandoned their checkpoints around the airfield
southwest of Pristina, after blocking access to it for three days.
Like NATO's commanders, they left control of the airfield to the
200 Russians who arrived unexpectedly on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all left,'' a Russian soldier said at the airport's gate,
guarded by two armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
   As the deadline came and went, Serbian soldiers could still be
seen in several cities, including Urosevac and Pristina, and NATO
officials acknowledged that not every last soldier or police
officer was likely to leave. Early Wednesday morning, a large
contingent remained at a headquarters in the center of Pristina,
and there was some gunfire heard throughout the evening. But NATO
officials said the Yugoslav authorities had made a good faith
effort to hand over control of Kosovo to NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may well be the odd straggler or broken down vehicle,''
said Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, spokesman for NATO's Kosovo
peacekeeping force, ``but that we are quite content with.''
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that Serbs on their way out of Kosovo were
torching buildings owned by Kosovo Albanians. Serbian soldiers
carrying gas cans could be seen moving through the village.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday evening, two Kosovo Albanians were shot and killed and
another two were wounded in a Pristina neighborhood called Suncani
Breg after arguing with a group of Serbian civilians on a
basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Pristina, a rocket-propelled grenade was fired near
where the Russian troops have stationed themselves. NATO officials
said they had no information on the incident, but a spokesman for
the Russians blamed it on the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   On a rural road near Kosovo Polje, a Serbian village west of
Pristina, Veljko Bangur helped his sister load a sofa, chairs and
other belongings into a tractor on Tuesday. He said it was no
longer safe to stay now that the Yugoslav army was withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are leaving because we are afraid of the people who kill _
NATO'' and the KLA, he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. refugee officials said they have grown increasingly worried
that the end of the war is creating a new refugee crisis. Dennis
McNamara, the special envoy of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said NATO should move quickly to provide assurances to
the Serbs that it is safe for them to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The return of refugees to Kosovo must not lead to a new
refugee exodus,'' he said at a news conference Tuesday in
Pristina's Grand Hotel. ``And we're starting to see signs that that
is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to provide such assurances, the commander of the
peacekeeping force, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson of Britain, held a
news conference Tuesday for Serbian journalists and pledged that
NATO would be evenhanded in overseeing the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do understand the concerns of the Serb population,'' he
said. ``I've made it clear to my soldiers that they must share my
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian leaders in Kosovo were not convinced. Vojislav Vukcevic,
the secretary general of the local branch of the Serbian Renewal
Movement, a political party, said the peacekeeping effort is
senseless if the Serbs who stay are not protected. ``Their mandate
is to implement the security and safety for both Serbs and
Albanians,'' he said of the NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement for ending NATO's air strikes,
the Yugoslav army and interior police forces must withdraw entirely
by Sunday. At that point, NATO will control all of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and U.N. officials have already begun discussions about
establishing some sort of civilian political and police authority
to govern the province, but for now there is none.
</P>
<P>
   Officials acknowledged that there were limits to NATO's control.
``You can't have a soldier on every street corner, in every hamlet
and in every village,'' Clifford, the NATO spokesman, said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After 78 days and tens of thousands of NATO bombs, the Yugoslav
army units that left on Tuesday remained, for the most part,
defiant and proud.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, a three- to four-mile convoy of army vehicles _
including tanks, armored personnel carriers, troop transports and
trucks hauling all manner of military equipment _ rumbled northwest
on the road toward Serbia from the Drenica Valley, scene of some of
the heaviest fighting in the war against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   One armored combat vehicle was festooned with balloons, while
another carried a sign saying ``Taxi'' and half a dozen soldiers on
its top. Others bore large pin-ups, including one of Marilyn
Monroe. Still another carried a street sign for the predominantly
Albanian city of Malisevo. Serbian flags flew from all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the convoy _ and the number of heavy weapons _
appeared to undercut NATO's statements that it had seriously ground
down the Yugoslav army. NATO officials said the army had withdrawn
37 tanks, 65 artillery pieces and 115 armored personnel carriers in
just the first phase of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   As the convoy passed Kosovo Polje, a village sacred to Serbs as
the scene of the epic battle against the Turks in 1389, people
gathered on the streets to salute the withdrawing troops. Soldiers
responded with their traditional three-fingered salute. The scene
mirrored the reception received by NATO troops as they passed
through Albanian villages, except that the crowds were smaller and
more subdued.

DRUG SLASHES BREAST CANCER RISK, STUDY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Final results of an international study reported Tuesday show
that a drug approved to fight the bone disease osteoporosis
significantly decreased the risk of breast cancer among
postmenopausal women.
</P>
<P>
   Women who took the drug, raloxifene, for three years lessened
the risk of breast cancer by 76 percent compared with those who
took a placebo, or dummy pill, in the study reported in the Journal
of the American Medical Association. Preliminary findings from the
study were reported at a scientific meeting last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results were quite dramatic, and we do not often see this
amount of reduction in preventive medicine,'' the head of the
study, Dr. Steven Cummings of the University of California at San
Francisco, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But it is premature to recommend raloxifene to lower the risk of
developing breast cancer except in clinical trials, the American
Society of Clinical Oncology said. For one thing, it remains to be
seen whether the benefit is long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   In treating breast cancer, doctors have long prescribed a
related drug, tamoxifen, to block the action of the female hormone,
estrogen, on breast tissue, where it can promote the growth of
cancer. Last year the Food and Drug Administration approved its use
as a cancer preventive for postmenopausal women at high risk of
developing the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But tamoxifen has its own hazards, such as increasing the risk
of cancer of the uterus and formation of blood clots in leg veins
that can be fatal if they travel to the lungs. Blood clots are also
an unwanted effect of raloxifene, the new study found.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of raloxifene as a treatment to prevent breast cancer
would probably increase sales of the drug, whose maker, Eli Lilly &AMP;
Co., sells it under the name Evista. Lilly financed the study
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe that raloxifene prevents estrogen-related
breast cancers by occupying the same molecular receptor sites as
the estrogen molecule on the surface of cells. Raloxifene blocks
estrogen's cancer promoting effects on breast and endometrial
tissue, and scientists have tested raloxifene in the hope it will
be safer than tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   The National Cancer Institute is sponsoring a head-to-head trial
of tamoxifen and raloxifene as breast cancer preventions among
22,000 women in 400 medical centers in the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The study was originally designed mainly to determine whether a
three-year course of raloxifene treatment reduces the risk of
broken bones among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Cummings
said findings from that portion of the study are to be published
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings' team also designed the study to test other conditions.
The breast cancer section involved 7,705 women under the age of 81
who were treated in 180 clinical centers in the United States and
24 other countries, mostly in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, 2,557 received the usual once-a-day tablet. Another
2,572 women took two tablets a day because the scientists were
uncertain of the most effective dose. A third group of 2,576 women
took two placebo, or dummy, pills a day.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists found 27 breast cancer cases among the 2,576 who
received placebos compared with 13 cases among the 5,129 women who
received raloxifene. The amount of raloxifene did not make a
difference in preventing breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reduction in risk of breast cancer within the first 40
months of treatment probably represents suppression or regression
of subclinical cancer,'' the authors wrote, referring to cancers
that are too small to be detected.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, women taking raloxifene were more likely to report
hot flashes, influenza-like symptoms, and cramps and fluid
accumulation in the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings said the study is being extended four years to learn
about the long-term effects of raloxifene and to help identify the
factors that may predispose some women taking raloxifene to develop
blood clots. Participants choosing to continue will take one
raloxifene tablet a day or placebo, Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   He said another leading medical journal, the New England Journal
of Medicine, had initially agreed to publish the raloxifene report
the AMA journal published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Cummings said the NEJ has a rigid policy against reporting
studies whose data have been publicized. He said the journal
returned the paper unpublished because news releases were issued in
conjunction with a lecture that a co-author, Dr. V. Craig Jordan of
Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, gave at a cancer
meeting last fall. In it, he reviewed all studies involving
raloxifene, Cummings said.  &QL;

GORE TERMS CLINTON AFFAIR `INEXCUSABLE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore says that President
Clinton's extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky was
``inexcusable'' and that the president had lied to him, just as he
had lied to everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did was inexcusable, and particularly as a father, I
felt that it was terribly wrong, obviously,'' Gore said in an
interview with Diane Sawyer of ABC News. The comments, to be
broadcast on ``20/20'' on Wednesday night, were the vice
president's most extensive yet on the topic of Clinton's affair.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the president lied to him, Gore said, ``Certainly the
impression that he gave me and the others that he worked with was
not the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believed Clinton last year when he wagged his finger
and said he ``did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
Lewinsky,'' Gore said, ``I didn't like that moment at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the half-hour interview, Gore said he wanted to
expand the gays-in-the-military policy that was begun by Clinton to
make it easier for homosexuals to serve. ``I'd like to see the
policy implemented differently,'' Gore said. ``I don't think
there's been enough compassion in that policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore clearly did not relish the questions about the president's
affair and dodged some of them. ``You can imagine how I felt,'' he
said at one point, without elaboration and without emotion.
</P>
<P>
   But being broadcast on the day of Gore's announcement for
president, the comments come as part of a larger effort by the vice
president to separate himself from the Clinton scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's announcement on Wednesday will highlight his devotion as
a husband and father. Throughout the ABC interview, he and his
wife, Tipper, held hands.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore was reportedly outraged at the president's behavior,
but she was less emphatic in the interview, saying she was ``very
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sawyer asked her what she would have done if she had been in
Hillary Rodham Clinton's shoes. ``I would _ I don't _ I can't
imagine it being me,'' Mrs. Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sawyer noted that the vice president had said last year that
Clinton would not admit to lying as part of a censure deal because
misleading statements were different from actually lying. She asked
Gore: ``Is that the article of faith that you want to run your
presidential campaign on?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, of course not,'' Gore answered quickly. Those remarks,
he said, were in the context of the partisan impeachment process.

MOST PRISONERS COMMIT VIOLENT CRIMES, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RIC KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Debunking the myth that Massachusetts prisons are
overflowing with first-time petty drug offenders, a new study has
found that the greatest number of inmates have been jailed for
violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The report, to be released by the nonpartisan think tank MassINC
Wednesday, says two violent offenders are put behind bars for every
drug offender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, based on the best available data, there is no
reason to believe that our prisons are full of people who don't
belong there,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the study suggests that the commonwealth's prisons
remain chronically overcrowded, running at 25 percent above
capacity despite a decade of expansion, because the state has been
unable to convert its felons into law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that another generation of prisons is
inevitable, MassINC said the state needs to radically alter its
approach to ensure that criminals don't come back as repeat
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The group says the state needs to change its prison philosophy
from one that simply adds beds to a graduated approach that guides
prisoners from lock-ups to expanded rehabilitation programs and
pre-release centers before returning them to the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you don't send them to crime school but prepare them to be
crime free,'' said Michael B. Gritton, MassINC's policy director.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Department of Correction said Tuesday that
Commissioner Michael Maloney would withhold comment until he has
read the report.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the American Friends Service Committe, a
human rights agency, said she is skeptical of the new study's
assertion that half the new offenders have committed violent
crimes. While she applauded MassINC's call for more treatment
programs, she said that issuing statements such as, ``Prisons are
not full of people who don't belong there,'' severely undermines
that effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to justify poor treatment for violent prisoners _
they get what they deserve,'' said Jamie Suarez-Potts, AFSC's
criminal-justice coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Flying in the face of critics who claim the way to cut the
state's prison population is by reducing mandatory-minimum
sentences for drug offenses, the MassINC study found:
</P>
<P>
   _ If all the drug offenders were set free tomorrow, the prison
population would still be 1,000 inmates above capacity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inmates serving mandatory sentences for drug crimes in 1997
were not first-time felons, but had been arraigned on 22.5 charges
as an adult, and had been convicted of half those charges.
</P>
<P>
   The report urges the state to adopt full-fledged sentencing
guidelines to reduce judicial discretion and mete out punishment
more consistently by increasing prison terms for repeat violent
offenders. It also recommends imposing intermediate sanctions on
lesser lawbreakers and calls for the parole board to take a greater
role in supervising ex-offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, from mandatory sentencing to maximum-security jail cells,
MassINC found a criminal-justice system which seems to promote
public safety may actually undercut that crusade in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the report calls for revamping mandatory-minimum
sentences for drug offenders by hitting them with requisite hard
time, but allowing them to earn good time by participating in drug
and alcohol treatment pre-release programs.
</P>
<P>
   With a state prison population doubling to more than 10,000
since 1985, MassINC says there needs to be an expansion of
transitional programs, from anger management training to supervised
contact with the ``free world.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, only 150 men at a time out of 10,000 are being
prepared for the life on the outside in pre-release programs.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 300 offenders graduate from pre-release each year.
Meanwhile, 1,000 go directly from a cell to the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week,'' the report warns, ``more than twenty felons are
put back on the street with little preparation for a crime-free
life.''

STRONG EARTHQUAKE HITS CENTRAL MEXICO  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A strong earthquake rattled central Mexico
Tuesday, injuring dozens of people and killing at least one woman
as buildings collapsed in the capital of Puebla state, east of
Mexico City, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Landslides blocked several rural highways in Puebla and Oaxaca
states, and some bridges were reported damaged, television and
radio reports said.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, the quake was felt strongly. Thousands of
residents fled into the streets as buildings swayed and the ground
roared, but damage appeared to be minor. Phone service was
interrupted in much of the city for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colorado
measured the quake at 6.5 on the Richter scale. Mexico's National
Seismological Center put it at 6.7.
</P>
<P>
   Both services recorded the quake at the same moment, 3:42 p.m.,
and located its epicenter in a rural area 125 miles southeast of
Mexico City, along a volcanic border dividing Oaxaca and Puebla
states.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Oaxaca said they had been unable to establish
communication with Huajuapan, the rural county northeast of the
state capital, that was the quake's epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   The worst damage reported was in the city center of Puebla, 55
miles east of Mexico City, where a 45-year-old woman was killed in
the collapse of an unidentified building, said reports on TV
Azteca.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Puebla Red Cross reported that the Puebla
City Hall collapsed, trapping a dozen municipal workers. The Red
Cross said a University of Puebla building that had housed
classrooms and the rector's office also was badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities at the Volkswagen plant in Puebla, the world's only
supplier of the Volkswagen Beetle and the New Beetle, suspended
production during the quake and ordered the plant inspected for
damage.

CLINTON URGES HOUSE NOT TO WEAKEN NEW GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Declaring America's heart and soul on the line,
President Clinton on Tuesday urged the House to embrace background
checks at gun shows and flea markets and resist weakening new gun
control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stepped up his rhetoric as Republican leaders adopted a
new strategy that may make it easier for the House to defeat
legislation for a background check for felony and mental illness
records when guns are sold at gun shows and flea markets _ two
areas exempted from 1994 gun control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The president cited a new Justice Department report that shows
the Brady bill's background check stopped 400,000 illegal handgun
sales in the 5{ years since the hotly contested system became law.
</P>
<P>
   He also surrounded himself in the Rose Garden with women members
of Congress and families of crime victims. He urged women, whom
polls show overwhelming support gun control efforts, to make their
voices heard on the gun control issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is too important an issue to be decided by strong-arm
lobbying tactics in Washington. The heart and soul of America is on
the line,'' Clinton said, prior to leaving for Europe where he will
attend an economic summit.
</P>
<P>
   The House will begin debate Thursday on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders this week agreed to separate the gun
control issues from a juvenile justice reform bill. A Senate
version, passed with Vice President Al Gore breaking the tie vote,
would extend the Brady bill, which requires a background check
within three business days.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Rep. John Dingell, a key Democratic ally of the pro-gun
forces, will offer an alternative for a 24-hour background check.
If the background check could not be performed within 24 hours, the
purchaser would receive the weapon anyway. The Senate rejected a
similar provision last month after a public outcry.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell's effort now has the blessing of GOP Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, and lends an aura of bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the changing politics of the gun debate, House
Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas told Reuters that it would be
hard for Democrats to make gun control a campaign issue next year,
if Democrats took the lead in passing weaker laws.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said he wanted to see Dingell's final draft but said ``it
is not inconceivable'' that he will vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accused the National Rifle Association of being ``wrong,
wrong, wrong'' on every argument it made against the Brady bill in
1994 and said the group tries to frighten its members with
untruths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want every member of Congress to think about this before
they vote on Thursday. What did they say six years ago? They said
the Brady bill threatened the right of citizens to own firearms.
Well, today we know the Second Amendment, hunting and sport
shooting are alive and well in America, just as alive and well as
they were in 1994,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the gun lobby argued in 1994 that the Brady
bill would not affect crime rates, yet gun crimes have fallen by 23
percent. And, the opponents argued that background checks would
have little effect because criminals don't buy guns at stores, yet
the law has stopped hundreds of thousands of such sales, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the new Justice Department report that showed 400,000
gun sales were stopped because of the background check. Two-thirds
of those sales would have been to people indicted or convicted of
felony crimes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll say again: Every single red flag they threw up about
all the danger and all the burden and all the problems this would
be to gun owners was wrong, wrong, wrong,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, insisted
the gun lobby has always supported an instant background check and
blasted the administration for failing to prosecute those felons
who attempt to illegally buy handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the White House to somehow try to characterize the NRA as
opposed to the instant check system is simply a lie,'' LaPierre
told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they are really after is trying to dismantle this
great American freedom, the Second Amendment, piece by piece, and
it has nothing to do with crime or even checks, which the NRA has
always supported the instant check,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre recalled Clinton's remarks recently in which he said he
supported gun registration. Clinton, during a television interview,
also said gun registration would never pass Congress.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre also chastised the vice president and president for
repeatedly misstating the age law. Both Gore and Clinton said they
support raising the age limit to purchase handguns from 18 to 21
but 21 alreadyis the law, LaPierre said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed he supported increasing the age limit for
possessing a handgun from 18 to 21 as well as mandatory sales of
child safety locks with each handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show widespread public support for all the
administration's gun control provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the only ones who are against it still are the NRA and
its allies in Congress. It seems that every day, they try another
procedural or rhetorical trick to confuse everyone and avoid
responsibility. These are the same kind of tactical smoke screens
they threw up six years ago,'' Clinton said.

   But Clinton maintained the times have changed for the gun lobby.
He said America is in a different place than it was six years ago
because of the series of school shootings such as the deaths of 15
at Colorado's Columbine High School and the average daily shooting
deaths of two to three children that never make the national news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the House to reject these bills and pass legislation
that will strengthen, not weaken, the Brady law. I want us to honor
the sacrifices of those people in Littleton, Colorado, not turn our
backs on them,'' Clinton said.

DNA TEST FREES MAN AFTER 16 YEARS IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JONESBORO, Ga. _ Just before he was sentenced to life in prison
for a rape he did not commit, Calvin Johnson Jr. told the judge
that his moment of redemption would one day come.
</P>
<P>
   ``With God as my witness, I have been falsely accused of these
crimes,'' he said in court in November 1983. ``I did not commit
them. I'm an innocent man, and I just pray in the name of Jesus
Christ that all this truth will be brought out, the truth will
eventually be brought out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, nearly 16 years later, Johnson's truth was finally
brought out. After a DNA test _ unavailable in 1983 _ proved that
Johnson could not have committed the crime, a different judge
signed the papers that released him into a hazy spring afternoon
and the arms of his family. He gamely shook the hand of the
prosecutor who put him into Hancock State Prison, thanked God and
his lawyers for the blessings of freedom, and wondered where he
would find a job.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson is more than just the latest of 61 prisoners in the
United States exonerated because of DNA evidence. In many ways, his
journey into prison was as dramatic as his hasty exit, revealing
the racial underpinnings of so many convictions in Georgia and the
rest of the Deep South, and raising questions about how many other
prisoners might also have lost their liberty on the basis of thin
witness identifications.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is black, was 25 when he was convicted by an
all-white jury here in Clayton County, a suburban area 30 miles
south of Atlanta that was the setting for Tara in ``Gone With the
Wind.'' The jury took only 45 minutes to convict him, rejecting the
testimony of four black witnesses who supported his alibi, but
accepting the courtroom identification of the white victim, even
though she had failed to pick him out of a lineup. She had
originally picked him out of photo array, where his picture had
been placed because he matched the general physical description of
the suspect and had a 1981 burglary conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The jury even set aside the testimony of an expert from the
Georgia State Crime Lab, who testified that a ``negroid pubic
hair'' found on the victim's bedsheet could not have been
Johnson's, based on a microscopic comparison. Robert Keller, who
prosecuted the case, convinced the jury that the expert's analysis
did not mean anything, saying the pubic hair might have become
attached to the sheet at a laundromat, or that the victim might
have somehow have picked it up in a public bathroom, mixing with
black people.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after Johnson was convicted in Clayton County, he
was put on trial in Atlanta for a rape that had similar
characteristics. Although the same witnesses testified for and
against him in both trials, the jury in Atlanta contained both
blacks and whites. He was acquitted on that rape, even though the
jury knew he had just been convicted of rape a few weeks before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is just part of the legacy of a court system in
Georgia that has excluded, and still excludes, African-Americans
from participation,'' said Stephen Bright, director of the Southern
Center for Human Rights, which provides legal representation for
inmates and poor defendants. ``The all-white jury in Clayton County
gave no credit to his testimony or the testimony of his four
witnesses. And of course the racially mixed jury came to a
dramatically different conclusion, and now we see that it was
right. What worries you is, there's no telling how many people
there are in the Georgia prison system convicted by all-white
juries who didn't have any DNA evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, at least six Georgia prisoners who were executed
were condemned by all-white juries, Bright said, and hundreds more
were convicted on that basis.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was freed through the work of Peter Neufeld and Barry
Scheck, two well-known New York lawyers who served on the O.J.
Simpson defense team and whose organization, the Innocence Project,
has now helped to exonerate 36 prisoners around the country through
DNA evidence. Of those, Johnson served the longest term before
being released. Standing on the courthouse steps with his client
Tuesday, Neufeld gave credit to Keller, now the district attorney
of Clayton County, for willingly turning over the vaginal swab
taken from the victim so that it could be matched with Johnson's
DNA, and not challenging the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not every DA has been as willing to do this, and we hope this
will be a model for other DAs throughout the state of Georgia,''
Neufeld said. ``This case hopefully will be a watershed event for
the people of Georgia to realize how unreliable eyewitness
identification can be.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though Keller was gracious in agreeing to Johnson's
release _ at one point extending his hand to Johnson in the
courtroom and saying, ``I'm sorry this happened'' _ he said he
would not have done anything differently as prosecutor, and denied
that race had anything to do with the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't feel good when something like this happens,'' he
said in an interview. ``It makes you go back and re-examine your
essence, how you deal with your fellow man, how you handled the
case. But I don't think anyone did anything wrong here. I dealt
with him the way I would have wanted to be dealt with.'' He added
that his office was unable to locate the victim in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who held a small New Testament in his hand as the judge
signed the order, said he bore no bitterness toward Keller, the
victim or the legal system. ``Bitterness will just destroy you,''
he said. But he added that he knew when he saw the all-white jury
in 1983 that he would never be acquitted. On three occasions,
Johnson rejected offers of parole because he would not sign an
admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who holds a bachelor's degree in mass communications
from Clark Atlanta University, said his religious faith got him
through each day of those 16 years, never allowing him to despair.
Now, he said, he was only looking forward, not back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent the last 16 years working for free, and now I need
a job,'' said Johnson, 41, who had worked as a courier. And with
that, he and his 70-year-old father got in a car and drove to a
hospital to see his mother, who suffered a stroke four months ago.
She had not been told in advance that he was a free man.

 &HT;    Baptist convention notebook: PETA protests fast food speaker
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With protesters near the Georgia Dome proclaiming that
``Jesus was a vegetarian,'' Chick-Fil-A-King Truett Cathy welcomed
Southern Baptists to Atlanta on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy left a little stuffed cow on the podium from the company's
``Eat More Chicken'' advertising campaign. It quickly became known
as the ``holy cow.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, from People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, included a man dressed as Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   PETA also has its message on a billboard that greeted Baptists
as they arrived for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of billboards, by the beginning of the convention, more
than 5,000 people had called a toll-free number appearing on
billboards and included in television, radio and newspaper
advertisements sponsored by the Southern Baptist Convention. The
campaign is part of ``Arms Around Atlanta,'' a joint effort of the
Southern Baptist North American Mission Board, the Georgia Baptist
Convention and several local Baptist associations.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptists, who have a reputation as tee-totalers, were
asked to go on the record with abstinence Tuesday by signing cards
pledging not to use alcohol or illegal drugs. Pushing the effort
was the Rev. Ted Stone, a North Carolina preacher who once served
four years in prison for shooting a man. Stone was hooked on
amphetamines at the time. ``We're trying to reach out and convince
people that a sober, self-controlled lifestyle is the best,'' he
said. Stone walked across the country twice, Washington to L.A. in
1996 and San Francisco ito Virginia Beach in 1998, to promote
sobriety.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpharetta, Ga.-based North American Mission Board of the
Southern Baptist Convention is unveiling a high-tech ``Vision
Center'' today. The center, a 5,000 square foot, $1.2 million
facility housed in the board's headquarters promises ``a phenomenal
interactive educational theme-park experience'' that propel
visitors ``through a global time capsule of past and present
mission fields.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Garner Clark from Autaugaville, Ala. always enjoys
attending the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention.
``It's a chance for preachers to get preached to,'' Garner said
Tuesday. And that's good news for members of Garner's church. They
``always tell me my preaching improves when I come home from these
conventions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman whose voice you couldn't quite hear during a concert
at Centennial Park Tuesday night was Pamela Valle of Bedford, Tex.
She was to take part in the evening event but lost her voice after
getting caught in thunderstorms that moved across Atlanta Monday
afternoon. Valle, who is the secretary-treasurer of the Conference
of Southern Baptist Evangelists, decided to take part in the
concert anyway. ``I'll just be lip-synching,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hoyle is spending some of his free time in Atlanta,
trying to make a good impression. Hoyle, pastor of Sharon Baptist
Church in Rural Retreat, Va., says he's getting to know people from
Atlanta that he meets in downtown hotels and restaurants. ``I want
people to see Southern Baptists as spiritual people who really care
about others,'' he said Tuesday. ``People are suprised when we
don't grab them and tell them they are going to hell.''
</P>

Baptist Convention from outside the Georgia Dome can log onto a

CAPE RESTAURANTS FEAR EFFECT OF US COD-FISHING BAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATHAM, Mass. _ Summer is here, and that means one thing: Pack
the car with beach blankets, binoculars, and bait and rods and head
to Cape ...Pollack?
</P>
<P>
   It may not sound as sweet, and many sea captains and restaurant
owners say pollack doesn't hold up as well as codfish as the
centerpiece of a Fishermen's Platter, but a federal crackdown on
cod fishing due to start in July has plenty of people predicting
that fresh cod will be as scarce as affordable housing for the
summer help.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the New England Fishery Management Council say a
30-day moratorium on cod is needed so that the tasty
bottom-dwelling fish have a chance to spawn without being trapped
in a cycle of overfishing that threatens the industry and the
species.
</P>
<P>
   But they aknowledge the ban on cod fishing on Georges Bank was
originally intended for May, when the demand for cod is not as
intense. But the council has been preoccupied with the cod crisis
in the Gulf of Maine, according to spokeswoman Pat Fiorelli, and
hours of public argument over that area meant the council was only
recently able to forward its Georges Bank recommendations to the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   Now, approaching peak tourist season, many local fishermen and
market owners are predicting a cod catastrophe, and blaming a slow
bureaucratic process for ruining the summer for them, and for
anyone hoping for a taste of a traditional Cape Cod meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will eliminate fresh cod for half the summer,''
said Robert Ahearn, owner of Swan River Seafoods in Dennisport, a
market and restaurant that has become a must-stop for summer
visitors. Swan River sells about 1,000 cod filets (that's 2,000
pounds of whole fish) during a typical July day.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is saying we shouldn't do something to preserve Cod,''
said Ahearn, who gets most of his cod from boats at the Chatham
Fish Pier. ``But the greatest demand is in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things people come to Cape Cod for,'' said
Ahearn, who last week petitioned the offices of Massachusets
Governor Paul Cellucci and Sen. John Kerry in hopes of a change in
policy. ``I talk to the customers out front,'' said Ahearn, whose
family has owned the market and restaurant 50 years. ``Fresh cod is
part of their vacation experience.''
</P>
<P>
   If cod dinners keep tourists coming in droves, they also keep
dinner on the table for the people who make a living on small
fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Taylor, a 44-year-old member of the Cape Cod Hook
Association, said he sees no benefit in the July restriction, and
that while May, or June, was OK with him and others in his fishing
community, July is too productive a month to cut out of his fishing
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be any fish _ any fresh ground fish _ for the
tourists,'' Taylor said. ``I don't think anyone even thought of
that,'' he said. Pollack was named as a possible cod substitute by
Fiorelli, but fishermen say that the cost of fishing just for
pollack would not be worth it in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, striped bass season will open in July, but, as any old salt
knows, bass is not for frying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead the tourists are going to get frozen fish,'' Taylor
said. ``Frozen fish from Iceland. And I've seen plenty of it. In my
opinion, it's horrible.'' Taylor said his own economic analysis
shows he will lose 16 percent of his annual income when the July
ban goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday officials for the local council, which includes
fishermen, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, said the
restraints were necessary, despite the delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention of this measure is to keep the cod mortality
rate down,'' said Teri Frady, spokeswoman for the National Marine
Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   She added that not all of George's Bank will be closed to Cod
fishing, and that many boats will be able to travel outside the
imposed boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Council spokesman Fiorelli said the proposed closings will be
reviewed in the next two weeks by officials at the federal agency,
and then go to US Commerce Secretary William Daley for final
aproval.

 &HT;    Although source of contamination found, European countries pull
Coke
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (f) Financial and (i) International categories.)
 &HT;    By Henry Unger

<P>
   ATLANTA _ First Belgium. Now Luxembourg, France and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Those nations are pulling Coca-Cola Co. beverages from store
shelves or stopping product shipments as a health scare spread
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the 113-year-old Atlanta institution, facing
an unprecedented assault on its brands in Europe, announced it had
found the sources of contamination that have sickened more than 100
Belgians.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola identified two causes: defective carbon dioxide
injected into drinks at a plant in Antwerp, Belgium, and an
offensive odor on the outside bottom of cans produced at a plant in
Dunkirk, France. The odor originated from a fungicide on wooden
pallets carrying cans that were sent to Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The bottling plants, which ship beverages to the affected
European countries, are operated by Atlanta-based Coca-Cola
Enterprises. Coca-Cola Co. owns a 40 percent stake in CCE.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Robert Baskin said discovery of the two
separate problems was coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Coke having some more bad luck,'' said Scott Wilkins,
a beverage analyst for Deutsche Bank. ``That's unbelievable.'' The
company has had to deal with a series of recent setbacks abroad and
at home:
</P>
<P>
   _ Antitrust opposition overseas to its proposed purchase of
Cadbury Schweppes' brands,
</P>
<P>
   _ Antitrust opposition to its buyout of Orangina in France,
</P>
<P>
   _ Declining worldwide beverage case sales,
</P>
<P>
   _ A racial discrimination lawsuit in the U.S.,
</P>
<P>
   _ And a falling stock price.
</P>
<P>
   With the contamination in Europe now identified, Coca-Cola hopes
it will soon get the green light to begin restocking the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the defective carbon dioxide supply has been
replaced and that it is ``taking all necessary steps'' to eliminate
the offensive odor from the outside of its cans.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the company said it ``continues to work closely
with the Belgian Health Ministry ... to assure the safety and
quality of our products for Belgian consumers, in order to obtain
final clearance for sales of the products in the Belgian market.''
</P>
<P>
   Luxembourg, which receives Coca-Cola products from Belgium,
banned them Tuesday after Belgium did so Monday. Coca-Cola also
withdrew from the Netherlands all products made in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, France banned shipments of the drinks produced at the
Dunkirk plant. Today, France is expected to prohibit the sale of
Dunkirk-produced cans throughout the entire country as well as
recall ones already on the shelves. But Coca-Cola will be allowed
to stock the shelves with drinks produced at other Coke plants.
</P>
<P>
   The company insisted Belgium was the only nation affected by the
health problems. Many sickened were students _ a key target of
Coke's marketing efforts _ who were hospitalized for nausea,
vomiting or stomach aches. At least one showed symptoms of
hemolysis, in which red blood cells are destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the students were drinking Coca-Cola to gain points that
could be redeemed for prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The health scare originating in Belgium goes to the very heart
of a company that prides itself on quality throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit disturbing that a big firm with worldwide fame ...
did not take far-reaching measures more spontaneously and more
promptly,'' said Belgian Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche. The
government estimated 15 million bottles or cans were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry analysts predicted the company will be able to
recover from the short-term hit to its image.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the management of Coke and CCE respond in a
forthright manner, there will not be a lasting impact on their
image when handled correctly,'' said Marc Cohen of Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect the company to reassure consumers in Europe with
aggressive marketing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the programs will be successful,'' said John Sicher,
editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. ``Consumers respect
companies that deal with problems on an aggressive basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Baskin, the company spokesman, said it was ``premature to
comment'' on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola could hardly have picked a worse time or place to have
these problems. Belgium has been hit with a major public health
crisis that started last month when chicken, eggs, beef, pork and
dairy products were found to be contaminated with cancer-causing
dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, it is too early to assess the impact, although most
analysts predicted it would be minimal since only a small
percentage of its sales come from the countries involved so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this as an issue from a financial standpoint,''
Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Cohen said CCE might have to take moderate, one-time
charges related to the recall of its products.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola shares, which are down 6 percent over the past five
trading sessions, closed lower Tuesday at $63.75, down $1.06 1/4.
CCE also closed down $1.06 1/4 at $34.18 3/4. Its shares are also
down 6 percent since last week.

promptly,'' said Belgian Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche. The
government estimated 15 million bottles or cans were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry analysts predicted the company will be able to
recover from the short-term hit to its image.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the management of Coke and CCE respond in a
forthright manner, there will not be a lasting impact on their
image when handled correctly,'' said Marc Cohen of Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect the company to reassure consumers in Europe with
aggressive marketing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the programs will be successful,'' said John Sicher,
editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. ``Consumers respect
companies that deal with problems on an aggressive basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Baskin, the company spokesman, said it was ``premature to
comment'' on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola could hardly have picked a worse time or place to have
these problems. Belgium has been hit with a major public health
crisis that started last month when chicken, eggs, beef, pork and
dairy products were found to be contaminated with cancer-causing
dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, it is too early to assess the impact, although most
analysts predicted it would be minimal since only a small
percentage of its sales come from the countries involved so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this as an issue from a financial standpoint,''
Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Cohen said CCE might have to take moderate, one-time
charges related to the recall of its products.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola shares, which are down 6 percent over the past five
trading sessions, closed lower Tuesday at $63.75, down $1.06 1/4.
CCE also closed down $1.06 1/4 at $34.18 3/4. Its shares are also
down 6 percent since last week.

TWO SIDES LOCKED IN FIERCE FIGHT FOR SWING VOTES ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: 2nd take expected to move by 9 p.m. ET.) 
 (nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House prepared for a high-stakes, heavily
lobbied debate on youth violence and guns, President Clinton and
pro-gun forces vied fiercely Tuesday for the votes of a critical
group of lawmakers from swing districts who could decide the
outcome of gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   With the contentious debate fracturing both parties in the
House, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., was working closely with Rep.
Tom DeLay, the majority whip from Texas, on an amendment that would
water down a provision passed by the Senate requiring background
checks on all buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   A confidant Dingell, whose victory would be a blow to the
president and the Democratic House leadership, predicted that he
had enough votes to prevail when the final gun control votes come
on Thursday. ``We will win,'' Dingell said.
</P>
<P>
   But the gun control issue has proven remarkably fluid and
unpredictable this spring, and gun control advocates were not
conceding the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, DeLay warned that the measure Dingell was
sponsoring might run into trouble. Republicans allied with DeLay
said they were concerned that conservatives might not rally around
him to vote for Dingell's amendment because they oppose any
restrictions at all on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering was part of an intensifying fight for votes, as
well as a public relations drive by both parties seeking to appeal
to suburban parents stricken by a horrific series of school
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day both Clinton and a series of Republicans held
competing news conferences on gun control and Republican efforts to
regulate media violence. Both portray them as issues of protecting
children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared in the White House Rose Garden surrounded by
female members of Congress from both parties to rally support for
an amendment by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., that would counter
Dingell's measure and is modeled after the Senate legislation on
gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed appeal to suburban women, Clinton cast gun control
as a women's issue, saying, ``Women who belong to both parties in
America, all over this country, have been in the forefront of this
fight. They care about it as mothers, as sisters, as daughters, as
citizens of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   He also implored lawmakers not to heed the National Rifle
Association. ``Once again the gun lobby is resisting with all its
might,'' Clinton said. ``Once again, we're battling not just for
the safety of our families but the soundness of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans were trying to shift the focus from
gun control to cultural issues that they said were more responsible
for youth violence. Late Monday, in a surprise maneuver, they
decided to bring two separate bills to the floor _ one on social
and entertainment issues and the other simply on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, they highlighted measures ranging from federal
permission to post the Ten Commandments in schools to criminal
penalties for adults who allow children access to entertainment
that Republicans described as ``obscenely violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., cast youth violence as an issue of
culture, and said violent material makes it no surprise that
teen-agers ``plan mass murders instead of graduation parties.''
</P>
<P>
   But even some Republicans were opposed to some of the directions
their party was taking. ``This is a big government solution to a
problem that government can actually do little to solve,'' said
Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   On the table in front of him were videos that he said minors
would be prohibited from watching under a key Republican proposal,
including ``Schindler's List,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' ``Mission
Impossible'' and ``Home Alone.''

QUAKE ROCKS CENTRAL MEXICO; SIX REPORTEDLY KILLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The strongest earthquake since a 1985 temblor
killed thousands shook central and southern Mexico Tuesday
afternoon, reportedly killing six people, injuring hundreds and
sending panicked residents into the streets as homes and buildings
swayed.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 on the Richter
scale, according to the National Seismological Service. Mexican
seismologists placed the epicenter in the southern state of Oaxaca,
about 135 miles southeast of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of serious damage or injury in
the Mexico City area although electricity and telephone service was
temporarily cut off throughout much of the city immediately after
the quake hit.
</P>
<P>
   In Puebla, a city of about 4 million residents that lies about
50 miles east of Mexico City and closer to the quake's epicenter,
officials reported five deaths. A dozen others were said to be
trapped under rubble and another 200 injuries were reported. There
were sporadic accounts of structural damage to buildings and homes.
One death was reported in Veracruz.
</P>
<P>
   Police and civil protection authorities blocked access to
Puebla's historic downtown out of fear that many buildings had
become unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial pictures transmitted by the TV Azteca television network
showed throngs of frightened residents milling in streets and on
sidewalks outside their homes and office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions appear to be relatively unharmed in Mexico City,''
Alberto Rodriguez, a spokesman for the Red Cross, told the network
during a live broadcast. ``What we are more concerned about are the
interior areas away from the capital. We are now beginning to
monitor our reports from there very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said an earthquake greater than a 6 magnitude can cause
serious damage, while a 7 means a major earthquake, capable of
causing severe and widespread destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from rural areas further south in Oaxaca and the
neighboring state of Guerrero, home to the resort city of Acapulco,
were still sketchy. Some emergency officials said they noted new
cracks along some roads, damaged homes and cars that were knocked
from one side of a street to another.
</P>
<P>
   The strong temblor struck the region at 3:42 p.m. local time,
the traditional lunch hour in this part of the country. Many of
those who stood out in the street were workers who had come home to
eat or students who had just arrived from school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the kitchen with my family when we started to feel
things shaking,'' said Mario de la Rosa, 37, who lives in a
southern Mexico City neighborhood. ``We're accustomed to feeling
things shake a little, but this was pretty scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Some seismologists expressed surprise that the quake's epicenter
appeared to be on land rather than along the coast, where most of
the country's tremors tend to originate. TV Azteca reported that
shaking was felt in five Mexican states, including Morelos and
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, who was on a day trip to the
Yucatan state of Quintana Roo, east of the earthquake, canceled his
visit and headed directly to Puebla to begin assessing the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's quake instantly brought back painful memories of the
major temblor that struck the country in September 1985. That
earthquake, the largest to ever hit Mexico, was recorded at a
magnitude of 8.1 on the open-ended Richter scale and killed some
10,000 people, who were crushed by old buildings that toppled
because they had been built without strict codes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that incident, new building regulations and
emergency drills were put in place.

   PIPELINE (Seattle) _ In most cases, Olympic Pipeline was there
first, laying its 400 miles of pipe more than 30 years ago. On the
Eastside of King County, houses and school that have that
paint-barely-dry look flank the pipeline as it carries jet fuel,
gasoline and diesel fuel south to Sea-Tac Airport, then the
Columbia River. But in North Bend, the homes and schools have come
first and town leaders have no intention of allowing a pipeline in
their midst. Yet Olympic, even as it tries to repair the damage
done from a deadly explosion of its pipeline in Bellingham, won't
stand for that.

ROSA PARKS, HERO OF CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, RECEIVES CONGRESSIONAL
GOLD MEDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rosa Parks, the Alabama seamstress whose 1955
refusal to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus to a white man
sparked the peaceful demonstrations of the civil rights movement,
accepted Congress' highest honor on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a wan voice that was the antithesis of the strength President
Clinton, House Speaker Dennis Hastert and others praised her for,
Mrs. Parks, 86 and frail, said, ``This will be encouragement for
all of us to continue until all people have equal rights.''
</P>
<P>
   An audience of perhaps 1,000 strained to hear her, moments after
the soprano Jessye Norman filled the Capitol Rotunda to its
180-foot ceiling with the notes of the Negro National Anthem,
``Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those behind the diva, the only white face that appeared
to sing along was Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   The award, the Congressional Gold Medal, the 121st in a line
that goes back to George Washington, was voted in April and hailed
her as ``a living icon for freedom in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parks, an official of the Montgomery Chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was
returning from work at the Montgomery Fair Department store late on
the afternoon of Dec. 1, 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The bus filled up, with whites in the front and blacks in the
black. The driver ordered four blacks in the front-most seats of
their section to get up and make room for whites. Three did. Mrs.
Parks did not. She was arrested under a city ordinance requiring
segregated buses.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, thousands of blacks in Montgomery stayed off
the buses. They shared rides, took taxis or walked to work. Mrs.
Parks and many others were fired from their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A young Baptist minister, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., led the
movement that maintained the boycott for more than a year,
insisting on nonviolence and telling blacks that ``the great glory
of American democracy is the right to protest for right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court threw out the bus ordinance the next December.
</P>
<P>
   After 381 days, blacks returned to the buses.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota observed that for
decades the medal was awarded only for military valor. Daschle, the
Senate minority leader, said, ``We offer this medal to Mrs. Parks
for helping us to understand that there is a force even greater
than military strength; that is the strength to love.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, chairman of the House
Republican Conference and the only black Republican in the House,
said, ``We are in a room where we have too often gathered to mourn
our fallen leaders _ and too seldom have gathered here to celebrate
our living treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   After death threats, Mrs. Parks moved to Michigan, where for 14
years she worked for Rep. John Conyers Jr., a Detroit Democrat. He
was on hand Tuesday, as was the only current member of Congress who
was serving when she was arrested, Sen. Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina, then a Democrat and now a Republican. At the time, he was
a fierce, filibustering enemy of civil rights legislation. Thurmond
changed his stand over the years.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Clinton said Mrs. Parks reminded America that
for millions the promise of liberty was illusory, saying, ``And so
she sat, anchored to that seat, as Dr. King said, by the
`accumulated indignities of days gone by and the countless
aspirations of generations yet unborn.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Parks' Republican senator from Michigan, Spencer Abraham,
said, ``Few of us, with all our high offices, will accomplish what
Rosa Parks did with just one action.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said he, too, had been uplifted by the medal, because
while a speaker meets ``many outstanding individuals, from sports
stars to heads of state,'' he had ``never felt so honored, as when
I was able to share an afternoon with Mrs. Parks not too long ago.
As we sat there, enjoying our tea, I couldn't help but feel
privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Julia Carson, the Indianapolis Democrat who led the effort
to award the medal, said Mrs. Parks, unlike those honored after
their deaths, was ``receiving the honor while she can still see it,
while she can still feel it.'' But the gold medal has not yet been
struck by the mint, and instead an artist's rendering was
presented.

 &HT;    Home Depot sues former senior exec
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot alleges that a former senior executive
raided its stores for employees and stole trade secrets for a
venture planned to compete with its Expo Design Centers.
</P>
<P>
   James W. Inglis, a former executive vice president and former
board member, is named as the lead defendant in a lawsuit filed in
Fulton County Superior Court last week. Home Depot claims that
Inglis improperly recruited and hired key Expo employees earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot wants the court to prevent Inglis from recruiting
more employees and seeks unspecified monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis is chief executive officer of Dekor Inc., according to
corporate documents filed in September with the Secretary of
State's office. The Marietta, Ga.-based business doesn't have any
stores, but plans to sell products such as kitchen countertops,
wallpaper and paint. The lawsuit indicates Inglis' first store
would open within two years.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also names as defendants Herb Biggers, Lawrence J.
Crawford and Kathy Schaag Haffamier, all former Home Depot
employees and metro Atlanta residents who are now working for
Inglis. The suit charges Inglis with cherry-picking a team of
experts in several crucial areas. For example, Crawford developed
proprietary Expo products from European vendors, while Haffamier
specialized in domestic products.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot won't say if Inglis, who left Home Depot in 1996, had
a noncompete agreement. Inglis and the other defendants declined to
comment on the lawsuit. According to the suit, Crawford and
Haffamier entered agreements with Inglis that were ``inconsistent''
with those they had at Home Depot. Home Depot declined to elaborate
on the allegations in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis' connection to Home Depot goes back to 1983, when he was
named vice president of merchandising after being recruited from
San Diego retailer Dixieline Lumber. He became a key player in Home
Depot's expansion. It was Inglis who first had the idea for Expo,
according to ``Inside Home Depot,'' a recently published book by
journalist Chris Roush. (Interestingly, Inglis is not mentioned in
``Built From Scratch,'' a new history of the company written by
founders Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank.)
</P>
<P>
   Soon after joining Home Depot, Inglis got the idea for Expo,
according to Roush's book. By 1991, Inglis had persuaded the
company to open the first Expo as a test in San Diego, followed by
the Expo in suburban Atlanta in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Expo concept, held up as a laboratory to test decor products
and services on a more upscale audience, went through a series of
ups and downs over the next eight years. Expo executives were
constantly trying and discarding products in an effort to find the
right formula. By the time the sixth Expo opened in Davie, Fla.,
last year, the concept had been completely revamped. The current
format differs dramatically from the Perimeter Expo with a sleeker
look and better organized floor plan, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have applauded the changes. With average sales per
store of more than $43 million, the Expo division could represent
10 percent of Home Depot's revenue within four years, according to
Prudential Securities analyst Wayne Hood. Home Depot announced last
year it would roll out the Expo concept nationwide with at least
200 stores over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the finished concept and long-awaited expansion came two
years after Inglis left Home Depot. Inglis, by then executive vice
president of strategic development, left in May 1996. Almost
immediately, he joined Kennesaw, Ga.-based flooring retailer Maxim
Group, a Home Depot competitor, as chief operating officer. He
later consulted for another Home Depot competitor, Chilean retailer
Sodimac Home Center, to help it get ready for Home Depot's foray
into Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   A key point of the claims in the lawsuit will be the degree to
which Inglis is allegedly copying Expo, said Ken Bernhardt,
professor of marketing at Georgia State University. ``Ideas get
stolen all the time in retail. The issue is whether he took
intellectual property, because retail concepts can't be patented.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit takes on added importance because Inglis was a board
member, said Erik Gordon, director of the center for retailing
research at University of Florida. ``Running a store is a lot
harder and a lot more subtle than it looks,'' Gordon said. ``If you
have non-public information about expansion plans and products,
then you have a competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Plagued by high turnover rates, other retailers have been taking
their employment problems to court. For example, Wal-Mart recently
sued Amazon.com for stealing computer experts and trade secrets.
The online bookseller agreed to reassign some former Wal-Mart
employees and return information it obtained from the employees.

SOUTHERN BAPTIST LEADER WANTS ONE MILLION NEW MEMBERS  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD VARA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Baptist Convention President Paige Patterson
challenged his denomination Tuesday to recruit 1 million new
members and collect $750 million for mission causes in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson issued the challenge during the opening day of the
national convention's annual meeting in the Georgia Dome. The
former Texan was also re-elected to a second one-year term as
president of the 15.7 million member denomination without
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson is also president of Southeastern Baptist Theological
Seminary in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In his convention sermon, Patterson also challenged the
predominantly white, rurally based denomination to reach out to the
inner cities and ethnic communities. He also announced plans for a
television ``superstation'' to broadcast nationally and later
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we lead to Christ and baptize 1 million people in 12
months _ 500,000 in America and 500,000 around the world?''
Patterson asked in challenging more than 11,000 delegates in the
Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The denomination now registers more than 400,000 baptisms
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelism has always been a high priority for Southern Baptists
but has taken on a new significance with convention leaders since
membership declined last year for the first time since 1926.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson issued an impassioned call for the denomination to
nearly double its annual giving to achieve the $750 million goal.
Southern Baptists contribute more than $400 million annually to
support national agencies and seminaries as well as national and
international missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as Southern Baptists could easily double our giving _ in
fact, we must,'' Patterson said. He said increased giving would
make possible a superstation that could broadcast daily worldwide.
``On our own superstation, we can teach and preach the full gospel
of the New Testament without the compromise we often face even on
Christian networks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other actions, convention leaders and delegates, known as
messengers, continued to criticize President Clinton for
proclaiming June as gay and lesbian pride month. Patterson and
other convention leaders have chastised Clinton for what they
perceive as affirmation of a sinful lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson ruled out of order a motion asking that Clinton's home
church, Immanuel Baptist Church of Little Rock, Ark., be given a
year to discipline the president or be declared out of
``fellowship'' with the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson ruled the motion out of order because the annual
meeting could not bind next year's assembly to take any actions.
</P>
<P>
   Immanuel Baptist Church did not send delegates to the meeting.
Pastor Rex Horne has not responded to media inquiries about his
reaction to the calls to discipline Clinton.
</P>

DOW ADVANCES BY 31.66; INFLATION DATA ARE AWAITED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks inched higher Tuesday in thin, convictionless
trading in advance of an important inflation report scheduled to be
released Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about what the May Consumer Price Index might show
caused bond traders to pare positions late Tuesday. And the sight
of rising long-term interest rates brought stock prices down from
their highs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 31.66 points, or
three-tenths of a percent, to 10,594.99. Blue chips that have been
punished recently _ a list that includes Procter &AMP; Gamble,
Citigroup and Merck _ led the advance Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader indexes, a rise in large technology stocks helped
to lift the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index by 7.16 points, or
five-tenths of a percent, to 1,301.16. The NASDAQ market, hit hard
on Monday, recovered a bit Tuesday as prices of some Internet
stocks came off their lows. The NASDAQ composite index rose 16.36
points, or seven-tenths of a percent, to 2,414.67. And the Russell
2000 index of smaller company stocks gained 2.48 points, or
six-tenths of a percent, to 434.01.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, the market gave a great account of itself a day
before an important number'' like the consumer price report, said
Ned Collins, head of stock trading at Daiwa Securities America.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no conviction about anything. Until we get some
definitive statement from the Fed about interest rates and start to
see some second-quarter earnings reports, the market will lack a
catalyst to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading activity reflected the lack of enthusiasm many seem to
have for stocks just now.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 696 million shares changed
hands. Volume on NASDAQ was 837 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   As Collins suggested, uncertainty is likely to remain mired in
the market for the rest of the week at least even if the consumer
price report shows that inflationary pressures are subdued. That is
because Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is
scheduled to testify before the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress on monetary policy and the economy. And Friday is a
``triple witching'' session, when options, futures contracts and
options on futures all expire. Trading on those days is often
volatile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be surprised to see the market trade in this
directionless fashion until the Fed holds its meeting at the end of
the month,'' said Hug Johnson, chief investment officer at First
Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee is scheduled to
hold two days of meetings beginning June 29. Most financial market
participants expect the central bank to raise short-term interest
rates by a quarter-point at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was a good one for semiconductor stocks, which rallied
after a Merrill Lynch analyst raised his estimate for the growth
rate in semiconductor revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments gained 5 1/8, to 134 3/8. Broadcom jumped 9
5/8, to 110 5/8. And Intel, the industry leader, rose 1 5/16, to 55
11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies also did well on expectations that demand for
gasoline is rising as the summer driving season gets under way.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, a Dow component, rose 1, to 82 1/8. BP Amoco gained 2
5/16, to 113 3/16. And Royal Dutch Petroleum was up 7/8, to 60 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Other market movers included Coca-Cola, which fell 1 1/16, to 63
3/4 after a health scare in parts of Europe led the company's
drinks to be pulled from shelves in some countries.
</P>
<P>
   CMP Group, which owns Maine's largest electric utility, saw its
shares jump 5 11/16, to 25 3/4, on news that Energy East, which
owns a New York utility, had offered to buy it for $1.2 billion.

<P>
   Millions of people across Latin America are, for better or
worse, getting a taste of U.S.-style health insurance. Pushed by
the rising expectations of a growing middle class, countries in the
region are opening their government-dominated health systems to
private companies, both domestic and foreign.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest United States insurers, seeing Latin America
as a prime growth market, are actively testing the waters from
Mexico to Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Latin Americans already
spend $120 billion annually on health care, or about $412 per
capita, adjusted to reflect local health costs. While this is only
about 1/9 of the total health spending in the United States, the
big Latin American countries are spending a much bigger share of
their economies on health than all the Asia-Pacific economies
except Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna International has already put together health plans with
3.3 million members in seven Latin American countries. The Cigna
International health care unit has 1.5 million members in five
countries. American International Group has more than 300,000
health insurance customers in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, government officials, physicians and health care
workers there are all too aware of the problems of managed care in
the United States, which include disputes over the decision-making
authority of doctors and growing numbers of people without health
coverage. But they hope to avoid similar pitfalls. Doctors' groups
in Brazil and Ecuador and the powerful government-allied unions in
Argentina, in fact, have resisted moves to privatize health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negative part of the picture,'' said Professor William
Hsiao, director of health systems studies at the Harvard School of
Public Health, ``is that the private health plans in these
countries compete by selecting the best risks'' _ recruiting
predominantly young and healthy members and avoiding people who
would be likely to need costly treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurance companies take the cream off the top: employees
of banks, high-tech companies, large multinationals,'' Hsiao said.
They do not operate in the countryside, where health services have
always been sparse.
</P>
<P>
   Governments have tried to provide at least rudimentary care,
typically by government doctors and public hospitals. However,
exploding populations and the rising cost of care have swamped the
public system as life expectancy in Latin America has risen to 71
years, about five years less than it is in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy Latin Americans still go to prestigious medical centers
in the United States and Europe, as they always have, or to Rio de
Janeiro, a world capital of cosmetic surgery. But middle-class
working people, who must often wait in line for hours at
overburdened clinics, have lost patience with the public system.
</P>
<P>
   With encouragement from the World Bank and other Washington
lending agencies that promote privatization, Chile, Colombia and
Brazil have lowered the bars that had kept out foreign-owned health
companies. Argentina and Mexico have taken the first such steps and
may go further after their coming presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care is an often contentious concept both north and
south of the Rio Grande, and U.S. companies are avoiding the term.
But they are preparing the ground for managed-care techniques,
setting up computerized information systems that can monitor the
practice patterns of physicians and hospitals, and help supervise
patients with expensive problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not used the term `managed care' in Argentina,'' said
Mark Tabak, chief executive of International Managed Care Advisers,
a New York-based fund that invested $50 million in a joint start-up
venture with Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires. The plan,
Provincia Salud, calls its business ``coordinated care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues of private health care companies are growing much
faster in Latin America than in the United States, where managed
care has matured into a slow-growth field with slim profits.
American International Group says its revenues in the region are
growing 20 percent annually on average.
</P>
<P>
   Chris James, a senior vice president of Cigna International
health care, said the number of health insurance customers and the
amounts they would be able to spend were growing significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``These markets are already larger than most countries in the
Asia-Pacific region, except Japan,'' he said. ``More significantly,
they are changing faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna International has invested $510 million in health care
ventures in Latin America over the last five years. Cigna has
invested $475 million overseas since 1997, most of it in health
care in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Both Aetna and Cigna had $800 million or more in Latin American
health care revenues last year. Profits have been modest so far,
but the companies project substantial payoffs down the road.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that forecast is that relatively easy savings _
what health care consultants call the low-hanging fruit _ are still
there to pick. For example, there are the big initial savings like
those that managed care reaped in the United States by paying
hospitals a fixed amount for each patient or a low negotiated rate.
As hospitals sent patients home sooner, charges dropped for
employers and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Also, unlike the U.S. market, the private insurance market in
many Latin American countries is not closely regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each country is on a different time frame,'' said Howard Kahn,
vice president for global health business at Aetna International.
``You have to be sensitive to the medical culture, the social
culture, the stage of economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   Some middle-class Latin Americans with good jobs say they are
glad to have private coverage, which so far has included few
restrictions on care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm happy,'' said Alejandra Couto, 34. Her son
Tomas, a premature baby who weighed less than 2 pounds at birth,
was treated for 10 weeks in a well-equipped Buenos Aires hospital
that is part of a big health care company that Aetna bought in
January for $120 million. Tomas, now 3 months old, has thrived, Ms.
Couto said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``In public hospitals you can have one nurse for eight
infants,'' she said. ``Here, it's one nurse for every two babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Couto said she paid $28 each month for coverage that her
American-owned employer, Foxboro Argentina, arranged with the Aetna
unit, Asistencia Medica Social Argentina. Her employer picked up
the charges not covered by the insurer.

 UNDATED: the insurer.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The good news, said Hsiao of Harvard, is that public and private
hospital officials and physicians ``all begin to think a new way''
_ they become alert to making the system more cost-effective and
efficient, which may someday lead to better care. ``These countries
are spending a significant amount of money for health care,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the World Bank's latest figures, Brazil spends 6.8
percent of its gross domestic product on health care, Chile 7.9
percent and Argentina 9.7 percent. The United States spent 13.5
percent of its gross domestic product on health care in 1997, the
most recent data available.
</P>
<P>
   Poor, elderly working people who were fully covered by
government social security programs now must come up with
co-payments in Chile and Argentina. This presents ``enormous
barriers to access,'' said Dr. Howard Waitzkin of the University of
New Mexico, one of the authors of a survey of the growth of managed
care in Latin America published in The New England Journal of
Medicine on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, the government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, taking advice
from free-market advocates trained at the University of Chicago,
began to privatize in the early 1980s. But private insurers still
cover fewer than 5 percent of those over 60 and typically charge
higher premiums to women of childbearing age, said Cristian Baeza,
a former head of the national insurance fund in Chile who is
joining the department of health policy and management at Johns
Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Ferreiro, a government official who supervises health
insurance in Chile, said, ``The current system of risk selection is
based on economic logic, but this does not make political or social
logic.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers, especially U.S. companies, yearn for anything to hold
costs down. But some expensive local practices may be hard to
change. Employees at one multinational in Brazil had a choice of
three health plans and could go to doctors belonging to any of them
at any time, said Helen Darling, a managed-care expert at the
employee-benefits consulting firm Watson Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that provide paid coverage often find that an employee
has ``lent'' his health plan identification card to a ``cousin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We run into that a lot,'' Kahn of Aetna said. But insurance
companies have to proceed carefully. ``We try to stay a step ahead
of the competition,'' he added, but if a company gets ``too far out
in front, it may lose customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we consider clear fraud in the United States may not be
considered fraud in some places.'' Kahn continued.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, the colossus of the region, 40 million people are
covered by hundreds of private health plans, from traditional
fee-for-service plans to varying degrees of managed care. Many
plans are cooperatives owned by physicians, but U.S. insurers and
venture capital funds hope to scoop them up and install their own
management methods.
</P>
<P>
   One giant federation of co-ops there, Unimed, which has 11
million members and 87,000 doctors, seems too big to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is the fastest-growing opportunity,'' James of Cigna
said. ``The public system doesn't work. Per capita spending on
health is less than $300,'' compared with more than $3,900 in the
United States in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of Argentina's 37 million people have some
coverage, mainly through labor union plans called obras sociales.
</P>
<P>
   ``No private company would do what we do to prevent disease and
improve the life style of our members,'' said Alberto Antoniotti,
the administrator of the Primero de Mayo clinic in La Matanza, an
industrial city near Buenos Aires. The clinic is operated by a
union that represents education workers.
</P>
<P>
   But members of small, weak unions typically get lower-quality
care in poorly equipped clinics, and at least 11 million people in
Argentina have no coverage at all.
</P>
<P>
   In his office, surrounded by photographs of Eva Peron _ who is
still revered as the patron saint of the obras sociales _ Jose Luis
Lingeri, the superintendent of the system, said people who now fall
through the cracks would have better access to coverage as the
weaker union plans merge into stronger plans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, critics say funds earmarked for health often vanish
into political slush funds and the pockets of union officials.
``The problem is, we have a political system that corrupts,'' said
Hector Carrica, a health care official of Argentine Workers
Central, a 750,000-member federation that competes with the much
larger unions allied with the big Peronist party.
</P>
<P>
   Two million people, most of them middle class, are covered by
prepaid plans like the Aetna-owned company, which has 240,000
members. Each provides access to one or two hospitals and a list of
doctors, much like a preferred provider network in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank lent Argentina $350 million to revise its system
and make it easier for obras sociales to deal with private
managed-care companies. But the politically powerful Peronist
unions blocked President Carlos Saul Menem's deregulation program
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross plans are also looking for Latin American
opportunities. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Delaware has a joint
venture with local partners in a small prepaid plan in Uruguay and
plans to expand in Argentina, where it already offers coverage to
people who go to U.S. medical centers. Blue Shield of California
and the Blues plans in Texas and Arizona have a joint venture that
intends to open shop in Mexico when they get the go-ahead from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is natural for the private sector to move into the health
system because public resources are so scarce,'' said Antonio
Palocci, a public health doctor in Brazil who is also a Workers
Party member of Congress. ``But I worry about foreign groups coming
in, because they might view health care more as a business than a
basic service.''

 &HT;    DNA tests prove Georgia man innocent of 16-year-old crimes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sixteen years ago, Calvin Crawford Johnson Jr. stood
in a Clayton County, Ga. courtroom and was sentenced to life in
prison for a rape and burglary he said he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``With God as my witness, I have been falsely accused of these
crimes,'' Johnson said. ``I'm an innocent man, and I pray in the
name of Jesus Christ that the truth will eventually be brought
out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Johnson's prayers were answered. At age 45, he
walked out of the same courthouse a free man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had faith that in some way, some day, the truth would come
out, and I kept the faith,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   DNA evidence _ collected from semen on cotton swabs filed away
with other evidence from the trial _ was tested last November at
the request of a New York-based defense attorneys organization. It
proved conclusively that although a College Park, Ga. woman
identified Johnson as the man who raped and sodomized her in 1983,
someone else had committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, in her early 20s, testified she was awakened in her
bed by an attacker sitting on her back. He pulled a belt around her
neck and choked her until she passed out. When she came to, the man
put a towel around her head and raped and sodomized her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt this woman was raped, and she picked Calvin
from a photographic array, but the evidence from the rape kit
proved conclusively that the person who committed the crime was not
Calvin Johnson,'' said Peter Neufeld, co-founder of the Innocence
Project, which specializes in DNA-based defense.
</P>
<P>
   The year after he was convicted of rape, a Fulton County, Ga.
jury acquitted Johnson, who had a 1981 burglary conviction, of a
sexual assault that had occurred two days before the Clayton County
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld, one of the lawyers on O.J. Simpson's defense team, said
Johnson had served the longest sentence of any of the 38 defendants
whose convictions have been overturned because of DNA-based
evidence presented by the Innocence Project.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his release Tuesday, Johnson was greeted by members of his
family, including his 70-year-old father. Calvin Johnson Sr. said
he saw little reason to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't celebrate tragedies,'' the elder Johnson said. ``It's
something that should've happened 16 years ago. So I'm not going to
celebrate now. It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly freed man spent Tuesday afternoon visiting his ailing
mother, 66-year-old JoAnn Johnson, at an Atlanta hospital. ``At one
point, she pointed to a tear running down her cheek,'' Johnson
said. ``I wiped it off. I knew it was a tear of joy.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with defense lawyers and prosecutors Tuesday,
Judge Matthew O. Simmons ordered a new trial for Johnson. Clayton
County District Attorney Bob Keller, who had prosecuted the case 16
years ago, then formally dropped the charges. Keller said he
decided not to prosecute Johnson again after seeing the DNA test
results. ``I didn't feel he should spend one more day in prison,''
said the prosecutor. Keller said Johnson could file a claim with
the state Board of Compensation for damages.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney also said his office tried to locate the
woman who was raped, but could not find her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this was a miscarriage or a failure of the
system,'' he said. ``It points out the tremendous advantages of new
testing that we didn't have in 1983. It is a tragedy when a person
spends so much time in prison, and I'm sorry for that.''
</P>
<P>
   During a quiet moment in the courtroom, Keller walked to the
defense table and extended his hand to Johnson.
``Congratulations,'' the prosecutor said. Johnson smiled, and the
men shook hands.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge told Johnson he was free, Johnson embraced his
lawyers, stood and hugged his father and his sisters, and smiled
when Neufeld handed him the pen used to sign the papers for his
freedom. ``The judge wanted you to have the pen,'' Neufeld said.
</P>
<P>
   On the courthouse steps, Johnson admitted he had been angry for
years after he was sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit. But
he abandoned his anger after he ``dedicated my life to God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason to harbor bitterness,'' said Johnson.
``If you hold that in your heart it will destroy you.''

<P>
   TOKYO _ An early morning firefight Tuesday in disputed waters in
the Yellow Sea receded into a verbal clash, as North Korea demanded
an apology and lashed out at South Korea for sinking one of its
warships.
</P>
<P>
   Each side contended that the other fired first. But the result
is not disputed. South Korean ships fired on and hit a North Korean
torpedo boat, causing it to catch fire and sink. All 17 North
Koreans aboard were killed, said the South Korean state-owned
Yonhap News Agency. Major South Korean newspaper said 20 or more
North Koreans had died.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean Defense Ministry did not release information on
North Korean casulaties. But it said five North Korean patrol boats
were also damaged in the firefight, possibly the fiercest naval
clash since the Korean War ended in 1953. Two South Korean boats
suffered mild damage, and seven South Koreans were seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is sure to put further strains on North Korea's
relations with the South and with the rest of the world. It also
occurs at an awkward moment as North Korea considers a United
States plan, devised by former Defense Secretary William Perry,
that could lead to a significant expansion of relations between
North Korea and the West, in exchange for concessions including an
agreement that the North end its long-range missile program.
</P>
<P>
   The clash may also be a setback for South Korean President Kim
Dae Jung, who has been pushing his ``sunshine policy'' of
engagement with the North. The South Korean government has
advocated stronger business ties and was instrumental in helping
the Hyundai Corp., a Korean chaebol, or giant conglomerate, set up
special tours to the scenic Mount Kumgang area in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Tours leave virtually every day, and there were scores of
tourists in North Korea, along with thousands of South Korean
business executives, when the gun battle occurred Tuesday. As South
Korean government officials tried to ensure the safety of its
citizens currently in the North, the two sides exchanged warnings
and threats, each blaming the other for the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We interpret North Korea's armed provocation as a very
significant act,'' said Hwang Won Tak, Kim's top security advisor.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts said that while there were still risks of more
skirmishes, Tuesday's confrontation was not likely to intensify.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of today's incident escalating into a full-scale
battle is low,'' an analyst at the Korea Institute for Defense
Analyses, Suh Choo Suk, said. ``The North merely wanted to turn the
area into disputed territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Others warned that there were still risks of miscalculation and
the situation was volatile.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more serious than before,'' said a South Korean
government official who works on North Korean matters and refused
to be identified. ``It's a buffer zone, they are fighting with each
other and there are battle ships. This is how wars begin.''
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation began June 7, when North Korean naval vessels
escorted fishing boats south of the ``northern limit line,'' the
customary line of demarcation between the two Koreas in the Yellow
Sea. The North does not recognize the line and periodically sends
ships south of it, but they normally retreat when ordered back by
South Korean patrol boats.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the North Korean vessels held their ground.
On Friday the South began to ram the North Korean boats to drive
them north again. Tuesday was the first time there was gunfire.
South Korean officials say one of its high-speed patrol boats fired
.76-millimeter rounds.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 North Korean vessels were involved. By nighttime, they
had all returned to their side of the line, Yonhap reported. The
news agency said that two North Korean boats remained only about a
mile north of the line.
</P>
<P>
   The official North Korean news agency said there were 12 South
Korean warships in Tuesday's clash and that they fired some 150
shells and more than 7,000 machine-gun bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Talks were held Tuesday at the border village of Panmunjom
between North Korea and the U.N. Command, beginning just moments
after news of the sinking North Korean ship reached negotiators.
The United Nations requested that both sides withdraw their ships
from the disputed waters, but no agreement was reached and
discussions ended after 90 minutes without any plans to resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South Koreans must immediately apologize for the serious
consequences of their armed provocations,'' said a statement issued
by the North Korea news agency. ``They must not run amok, clearly
mindful that if military provocations are continued, they will meet
a thousand-fold retaliatory blow.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash took place in a good crab fishing area, at the height
of the crab season, which is why North Korean fishing boats were in
the area. North Korea has been plagued by widespread famine, and it
particularly values crabs because it can export them for hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea is sending batches of fertilizer to North Korea, as
a condition for two-way talks that are expected to take place in
Beijing on June 21. Tuesday, however, the South Korean government
said that one ship with about 14,000 tons of fertilizer, or 14
percent of the agreed-upon amount, turned back toward the South
until its safety could be assured.
</P>
<P>
   Hwang Dong-kyu, a spokesman for the South Korean Joint Chief of
Staff, said that the United States was helping South Korea
formulate measures to respond to North Korea.

FCC SAYS IT SHOULD REGULATE HIGH-SPEED ACCESS TO INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: includes information budgeted earlier as TIME-APPOINT) 
(Please note that the word (AT) within parentheses has been used in
the 3rd graf instead of the symbol.)

 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anxious cable companies got a boost Tuesday when the chairman of
the Federal Communications Commission, William Kennard, said his
agency, not local governments, should regulate high-speed Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the FCC and Congress have declined to regulate cable
Internet services. Kennard, in a speech to the National Cable
Television Association in Chicago, was responding to a federal
court ruling in Portland, Ore., two weeks ago affirming the
authority of local governments to require AT&AMP;T Corp. to allow
competing Internet service providers onto the cable system it
acquired in its purchase of Telecommunications Inc. this year.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has said it will appeal the decision, but cable executives
want assurance that if they spend billions upgrading their cable
systems, they will be able to use their own high-speed Internet
access providers. AT&AMP;T is a majority owner of the cable-Internet
service Excite(at)Home, while Time Warner Inc. owns the Roadrunner
cable modem service.
</P>
<P>
   America Online and other Internet service providers are lobbying
the FCC and local governments to force the cable companies to open
their systems to them.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said he was studying his options for getting involved in
the Portland case. Cheryl Leanza, deputy director of Media Access
Project, a nonprofit telecommunications law firm, said that
generally courts had tended to defer to the FCC in complex
regulatory matters.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland case was widely followed because it set a precedent
for how other local governments might behave.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a power struggle that goes back to the
Civil War,'' said Howard Anderson, president of Yankee Group, a
consulting firm. ``It is a question of whether the federal
government or the state government will have control. For the cable
operators, it is not so much about money, as about power. What they
want to do is to exclude the other Internet providers.''
</P>
<P>
   News that the FCC might intervene in the matter sent stocks of
cable operators up Tuesday. Time Warner shares rose $4.625 to close
at $66.687, Comcast rose $1.93 to close at $32.875 and Adelphia
jumped $6.875 to close at $62.875.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner stock also benefited from its bid to focus attention
on its Internet-related business. Yesterday it named Richard
Bressler, who has been the company's chief financial officer since
1995, head of its new online unit, Time Warner Digital Media, which
includes all the company's Internet presence, including electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's chairman, Gerald Levin, described the new entity
as the company's ``single most important growth area.''

 &HT;    Braves Notebook: Remlinger doesn't focus on ERA
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mike Remlinger insists his quality pitching is the
product of his new environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very confident that whatever I did this year I'd have a
chance to have the best year I've had,'' Remlinger said. ``The No.
1 reason is the people around me. I fully believe when you're
surrounded by a lot of ability you elevate your game to their
level.''
</P>
<P>
   After the weekend barrage of offense, the reliever who came to
the Braves in the Denny Neagle trade from Cincinnati stands as the
only Braves pitcher with an ERA under 2.00. Through Monday's
scoreless inning, Remlinger was 2-1 with a 1.42 ERA in 28
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell Remlinger his ERA. Taking the advice of former
Reds teammate Jeff Shaw, who's now the Dodgers' closer, he looked
at his statistics a month into the season to figure out what he
needs to improve on, and he hasn't looked at them since. Granted
the former Dartmouth College pitcher probably has a pretty good
idea of what they are, but he's not going to check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night I want to go out and do at least as good as I did
the night before,'' Remlinger said. ``If you start looking at your
numbers, you start believing in them.''
</P>
<P>
   For a guy who'd been dubbed a pitcher with control problems,
Remlinger's done a good job of hiding it. He's limited the walks to
14 in 31 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main reasons I've had control problems in the past
is some of the same reasons Odalis (Perez) is now,'' Remlinger
said. ``I was trying to do too much with my fastball. The key is to
stay under control with it. You'll have better command but you'll
also have better velocity. It's a hard lesson to learn. It's taken
me 13 years to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Power output
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez's home run Monday night in the Astrodome was his
seventh of the year, ending a stretch of 17 games without a home
run. This time last year, Lopez had hit 13 home runs on his way to
his career-high of 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't what I was expecting, but I'm dealing with it,''
said Lopez, who's hitting a team-high .314. ``I understand every
year is different. I say the season's not over yet. I've just had a
slow start. So far what I'm doing is not focus on what I've done so
far and to focus on what I'm going to do. I'm hitting the ball
hard, sometimes I can't lift it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker react
</P>
<P>
   So John Rocker's streak of 16 scoreless innings ended in the
eighth inning on Monday night with a bang, as in Jeff Bagwell's
home run to the second deck of seats in left field. Rocker gave up
another run on two hits and a pair of wild pitches for runs No. 9
and 10 in the 10-4 loss. That was the first home run Rocker had
allowed this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been 5-4, I wouldn't have given up anything,'' said
Rocker, who's ERA rose from 1.69 to 2.28. ``It's tough. When I come
in and it's a save situation, I've got a better idea of what I want
to do, instead of going through the motions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had gone six games without a save situation, this
after Rocker had been getting around four chances a week. It was
Rocker's first appearance in five days, his longest stretch without
pitching since the middle of May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel exactly comfortable out there,'' Rocker said.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest all-star balloting, Chipper Jones was still
trailing Matt Williams at third base, 203,745 votes to 195,454.
Outfielder Brian Jordan had moved up to eighth among outfielders
with 109,601 votes. Those two and Rocker will be Atlanta's best
hopes for the All-Star team in a rare year where a Braves starting
pitcher isn't expected to make it....
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have signed three more of their draft picks, all
right-handed pitchers, including 23rd round pick Kyle Colton of
Longwood, Fla., 38th round pick Anthony Sclafani of Staten Island,
NY and 49th round pick Nathan Kent from the University of Kentucky.
All three have been assigned to Braves rookie Gulf Coast Braves
team. The Braves have signed 21 of their 49 draft choices. They've
also signed six free agents, including catcher Earl Guilliams from
Danville, Va.

SPURS A GAMBLER'S BET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ In this most unusual season, we have two
appropriate teams still left standing. There are the heretofore
spineless Spurs against the heretofore dysfunctional Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   All is well in both camps now, spiritually speaking. Larry
Johnson has found Allah, if not a cure for his ailing right knee.
David Robinson has found Tim Duncan and, we suspect, won't mind
this summer if Duncan shows up at his house with foam shaving cream
instead of Edge gel.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are on a roll. The Knicks have fashioned the most
unlikely of playoff runs, one fraught with corporate intrigue,
injuries to key personnel, and the emergence of postseason
supernovae. By comparison, the Spurs have been quiet and efficient,
steamrolling two pretty good teams en route to their first berth in
the NBA Finals and saying all the right things.
</P>
<P>
   As matchups go, this one looks hopelessly lopsided in San
Antonio's direction. The Spurs have the inside game with two of the
best big men of all time. They have snipers. They remain one of the
most difficult teams to score against, even more so in this season
of the offensively challenged. They have veterans who've been
there, done that.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, however, have defied all conventional laws of hoop
physics ever since Allan Houston got that Nelsonian roll in Game 5
against Miami. They didn't match up with Indiana, either, and look
what happened. They had no inside game against the Pacers and
outshot them, 33-9, at the line in deciding Game 6. They have
unleashed an unstoppable Marcus Camby on the basketball world and
he has gotten better and better as the games got more meaningful.
They have brushed aside the loss of Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the teams are fairly even entering the series,
which starts Wednesday night at the hideous Alamodome. The Spurs
shoot a little better. So do their opponents. San Antonio has a
better scoring differential (8.1 to 4.3) and a big edge in assists
per game (which comes as no surprise, given the Knicks' two point
guards). Each team has had postseason success on the road; the
Spurs are 6-0, New York is 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs also have had the tougher road. While the Knicks were
gift-wrapped the pathetic Hawks in Round 2, the Spurs went up
against the Lakers. San Antonio then had to deal with Portland in
the conference finals, while the Knicks got 4-point plays and an
overconfident Pacers team.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas likes the Spurs, which is to be expected. Looking at
the matchups, it's not hard to see why:
</P>
<P>
   FRONTCOURT: This is Reagan-Mondale stuff. Duncan, Robinson, and
Sean Elliott form as cohesive and effective a front line as there
is. Not only can Robinson and Duncan score and pass, they also
defend, rebound, and block shots. Elliott (and the designated
shooter guards) give San Antonio a perimeter presence much like the
Rockets had in their title years. New York will present Chris
Dudley, Latrell Sprewell, a wobbly Larry Johnson, Kurt Thomas and,
we assume very quickly, Camby. Who's going to rebound in this
bunch? Camby is almost required to come up huge and Sprewell has to
utilize his quickness, put the perimeter jumper in his locker, and
drive to the basket. He can break down Elliott, but there's going
to be someone there once he does. All in all, if the game is won in
the trenches, the Spurs look very solid.
</P>
<P>
   BACKCOURT: Stephon Marbury said at the end of the season that
the Knicks would never, never, ever win a championship with Charlie
Ward and Chris Childs. At the time, it seemed like an accurate, if
boorish, statement. Point guard isn't the Knicks' strength. Ward
might as well be invisible. Childs has his moments, but they're
infrequent. Allan Houston, however, stepped into the Knicks' Big
Time Game Hall of Fame with his 32-point submission in Game 6. It
was heroic. Emboldened by that, he has to take a similar approach
to motormouth tough guy Mario Elie. So far, however, Houston has
been maddeningly inconsistent; that big game against Indiana was
about his fourth such effort in three years. Elie and Avery Johnson
don't exactly conjure up images of Monroe and Frazier, but they've
been a succesful tandem. Johnson continually gets left alone on
double-teams and has made the Timberwolves, Lakers, and Trail
Blazers pay for such stupidity. Elie is in a shooting slump, but
he's a prime time performer with two rings and an ornery streak the
Spurs need. The Knicks can't leave these guys open on rotations or
they will kill them.
</P>
<P>
   BENCH: With LJ iffy, does Camby start or stay where he is? If he
starts, that gives the Knicks only Childs and Thomas as regular
reserves. Camby was a game-changer coming off the bench against
Indiana. San Antonio, meanwhile, can go big (Malik Rose, Will
Perdue) and small (Jerome Kersey, Jaren Jackson, Steve Kerr) off
the pine. They're deeper and have more balance. The Knicks
basically will be down to seven men if Johnson can't go. San
Antonio can go to its 11th man if need be (Antonio Daniels) and
still keep a beat.
</P>
<P>
   INTANGIBLES: The Knicks clearly are operating on some parallel
universe in getting here with three straight upsets. They have
managed to become almost likable _ almost _ despite the presence of
some lads with, shall we say, shady pasts? San Antonio presents the
NBA version of ``Got Milk?'' Look at it this way. Can you envision
David Stern standing at halfcourt at Madison Square Garden next
November and presenting a championship ring to Sprewell? Neither
can we.

ABC LURES BACK JACKSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Keith Jackson will rumble once again.
</P>
<P>
   The dean of college football play-by-play will come out of
self-imposed retirement to do an exclusive schedule of weekly
Pac-10 games for ABC. It will end with his customary position at
the Rose Bowl, which in 2002 will host the national title game.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's agreement with new ABC Sports president Howard Katz
allows him to decide year by year whether to stay.
</P>
<P>
   In Jackson's mind, all ABC had to do was ask _ or more
specifically, Katz had to present a travel-light schedule _ and
he'd think about coming back. The previous ABC Sports regime,
headed up by Steve Bornstein, never broached him about returning or
gave him the other option, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense was they wanted to change and that was fine,''
Jackson said about ABC under Bornstein and his decision to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Katz asked him about returning at a social event. Jackson and
his wife, Tori Ann, who live in Sherman Oaks and vacation
frequently in Vancouver, decided it was worth it, just months after
he had called it quits following 28 years of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple _ Howard called,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting travel 90 percent is probably the single biggest
factor. It also means finishing where I started. I settled in the
West in 1950 (attending Washington State after leaving the Marines)
and that's not going to change. The fact I can do what I like to do
best and sleep in my own bed was a relatively easy decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds easy to retire and suddenly resurface, but I
wouldn't have done it if I could not stay in the West. Others will
do the big games and that doesn't bother me a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Katz: ``I was taking a shot in the dark. He's an
extraordinary man and staying close to home was a critical
ingredient to him. There are not very many people any of us know
who'd be willing to enter into this kind of arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson will do up to 13 Pac-10 games this season, but at least
half will be at places he can drive _ not just USC and UCLA, but
even up to the Bay Area and to Arizona. His first assignment,
however, will be Cal's game at Nebraska, which he was planning to
attend anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Along with being able to stay out West _ he's expecting his
first granddaughter in August _ the other factor is that Jackson
will remain with his partner of the last 12 years, Bob Griese. The
only problem for Griese is he lives in Miami and will have to fly
to the West Coast each week.
</P>
<P>
   But Griese looked like ABC's odd-man out anyway. Rather than
naming a new No. 1 play-by-play man to replace Jackson, the network
has decided to keep the Brent Musburger-Dan Fouts and Brad
Nessler-Gary Danielson teams intact and rotate them to games
considered the top national contest of the week.

WITH GATES ON THE HILL, THE GOP IS ON THE MAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CONGRESS-Y2K) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore may not have invented the Internet, but he
and President Clinton clearly perfected the skill of extracting
political contributions from Silicon Valley. Now, in a three-day
``High-Tech Summit'' on Capitol Hill, Republicans are trying to
show that they have the capacity to be even better friends of Bill
Gates and his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning Gates, his once-sharp barbs about Washington
lawmakers replaced with deferential comments like ``you've raised
an interesting issue, Senator,'' was filled with prognostications
about how the Web, wireless networks and electronic commerce would
turn ``consumers into big winners.''
</P>
<P>
   And the members of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee,
led by Republicans, were so filled with praise for Microsoft Corp.
and its entrepreneurial ilk that they only once, and then only
obliquely, raised the uncomfortable question of how antitrust laws
were applied to the world's most powerful software company. Left
unsaid, but understood, was that it is President Clinton's Justice
Department that is pursuing Microsoft in court a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the subtext of the three days of hearings, which began
with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and ended Tuesday with
Gates' appearance, is that Republicans are eager to get the
government off the Valley's back. Sure, many actual denizens of
Silicon Valley would be happy to see Microsoft get its hand slapped
by the government. But that didn't stop heads from nodding Tuesday
when Gates talked about how keeping ``a light hand'' on regulation
of technology industries ``is working very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Gates finished talking than the Senate voted to
lighten the touch even more: Over the administration's objections,
on Tuesday it approved a bill that would limit the liability of
high-technology companies for any damage by the Year 2000 bug.
President Clinton has pledged to veto the legislation, a version of
which has already passed in the House, giving yet another wedge for
Republicans who argue that the White House is the Valley's
fair-weather friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things going on here,'' a Republican member of
the committee said after Tuesday's hearings, asking not to be
further identified. ``There are real issues we'll have to deal
with,'' he said, among them congressional hearings on Internet
privacy, data encryption, support for basic research. ``And there
are questions of political funding. Which of those goes first, that
will depend on how cynical you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates once reveled in his apolitical nature. Until a few years
ago, Microsoft maintained only a small presence in Washington,
eschewing professional lobbyists and suggesting that the importance
of what happens in hearing rooms pales in comparison to what
happens in software labs. Meanwhile the Republican leadership, or
at least those leaders without significant high-technology
constituencies, largely ceded the territory to Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday they see an opportunity. Software makers are still
haggling with the administration, and Gore in particular, over U.S.
rules limiting the export of programs that offer high-level
encryption of data _ which U.S. intelligence agencies fear will be
exploited by potential enemies. At Tuesday's hearings, Network
Associates Inc. president William Larson described how the company
is about to lose ``a seven-figure deal'' to provide such software
to Chrysler, after its new parent,  &UR; DaimlerChrysler &LR; , insisted on
purchasing programs that could be shipped around the world. The
business is likely to go to a German competitor, Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   Others used the moment to lobby for an extension of the research
and development tax break. Charles Vest, the president of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, warned against what he
termed ``growing complacency'' about U.S. high technology
superiority, noting that federal funding for basic research and
development was declining. He said that at this point ``the United
States is living off of historical assets that are not being
renewed.'' The Internet's origins lie in a system developed by the
Pentagon and used for years, largely in obscurity, by academics.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly the big draw Tuesday was Gates, who received the
gentlest of handling all around. There were no tough questions
about charges that have arisen during the antitrust trial. In fact,
there were no tough questions at all _ either from the senators or
from students who were asking questions, via an Internet link, from
university and high school projects that Microsoft is backing.
</P>
<P>
   While it was never discussed, the Republican-dominated panel was
clearly aware that Microsoft greatly increased its giving to
political causes in the 1997 and 1998 election cycles, and the
expectation is that the sum could increase dramatically for the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The company and its employees gave about $1.3 million in
unregulated ``soft money'' over the last two years, putting them
among the top dozen or so in this category.
</P>
<P>
   It was listed as a ``table sponsor'' for the Republican
Congressional Committee dinner last week. While tables sell for
only $25,000, the move was viewed as a sign of things to come as
Republicans seek to exploit Microsoft's unhappiness with its
treatment by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has increased its permanent lobbying staff in
Washington and has also reached out to some of the capital's
longtime consultants. Among the lobbyists under contract to
Microsoft is former Republican National Committee chairman Haley
Barbour.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly two-thirds of Microsoft's political spending already
goes to Republicans, a figure that a senior employee at the
company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters said ``would probably come
as a surprise to most Microsoft employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates did everything he could Tuesday to steer clear of
controversy. He talked about forthcoming inventions that would help
members of Congress in their work, including new types of portable
digital devices that would help them ``access your own `digital
dashboard' '' even when they are out of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He banished from his vocabulary almost all his usual tech-speak,
talking as if he was giving a speech to an interested but somewhat
unsophisticated chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Invited to give his views on the state of U.S. antitrust laws,
he said that ``the laws as they are currently written are fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication he left is that they are being wrongly
interpreted in Microsoft's case. But he carefully dodged specific
mention of the litigation, other than to say ``things like
integration of new features are one of the freedoms companies
have'' under those laws.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Microsoft case hinges on the question of whether the
company is integrating its Internet browser into the Windows
operating system in a way that undercuts the ability of competing
browsers to operate.

ENERGY DEPARTMENT ROLE GROWS IN RACE TO MAP GENOME  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Department of Energy intends to play a
significant role in sequencing the human genome by decoding the DNA
of three of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes. To meet this goal,
it has leased 24 DNA sequencing machines for its Joint Genome
Institute, the Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Though often overshadowed by the National Institutes of Health,
the Department of Energy was the first to propose that the human
genome be sequenced and has remained active in the field even after
university biologists supported by the NIH dropped their resistance
to the project and assumed a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists at the Department's nuclear weapons facilities became
interested in sequencing DNA, which means determining the order of
the molecule's chemical subunits, as a way to understand the effect
of radiation on human tissues. The Joint Genome Institute, based in
Walnut Creek, Calif., is a collaboration between the Los Alamos and
Livermore weapons labs and the physics lab at Lawrence Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The public consortium to sequence the human genome, which also
includes the Wellcome Trust of London and laboratories in France,
Germany and Japan, has pledged to complete a ``rough draft'' by
next March. The draft will contain the decoded sequence of probably
90 percent of the 3 billion units of human DNA, including almost
all the genes, which are of great medical importance. The
accelerated timetable was announced after Celera, a private
company, said last May it would sequence the human genome within
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between the public consortium and Celera has been
complicated because Celera was established by the PE Corp., maker
of the leading brand of DNA sequencing machines. Even though Celera
is now their rival, the NIH genome sequencing centers have
continued to purchase the PE Corp.'s machines, which cost $300,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy has broken the mold by leasing its new
machines from the PE Corp.'s rival, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech of
Piscataway, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent conference at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long
Island, biologists rated the two genome sequencing machines of
roughly equal quality.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department's genome institute has sequenced 60
million bases of DNA so far. But it must sequence some 240 million
more in the next nine months if it is to meet the consortium's
deadline.

 WASHINGTON: ``Home Alone.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday night, after a closed-door party caucus, Republicans
were still trying to decide which of nearly 200 measures relating
to gun control and youth violence to allow to the floor for a
debate expected to last 15 hours over two days.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were leaning toward allowing about 40
amendments on entertainment, culture and law enforcement _
including one on school prayer and the one allowing the Ten
Commandments to be posted in schools.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt accused the Republicans of
seeking to rig House procedures in their favor. ``This is not a
legislative process,'' he said in a letter to Speaker Dennis
Hastert, ``it is a deliberate effort to give gun control opponents
every advantage while depriving gun control advocates of vital
information.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the gun control measures that were the focus of the
heaviest pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to take up several competing versions of
the measure on background checks at gun shows. It is also to
consider requirements for child safety devices on new handguns, a
raise in the minimum age for all purchases of handguns to 21 from
18, a ban on the import of high capacity ammunition clips and new
restrictions on the possession of semiautomatic rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Several versions of each of these provisions have been proposed
by an array of lawmakers, some stronger than others. As of Tuesday
night, Republicans appeared likely to let to the floor a Republican
version of the child safety device measure that is less stringent
than the Democrats were proposing. But they were looking to allow
the Democratic version of the ban on imported ammunition clips to
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association had about a dozen lobbyists
working Capitol Hill against the stricter gun control alternatives
while Hand Gun Control, a gun control group, had set up phone banks
to urge gun control advocates to call Congress. Both sides have
also been running radio ads in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the Senate, where the breadth of a lawmaker's
constituency leads to a broad view, House members represent
smaller, more homogeneous areas. This makes geography destiny when
it comes to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   So representatives from the cities and their nearby suburbs
generally vote for gun control, including most Democrats and at
least 20 to 30 Republicans. Southerners as well as lawmakers from
the western mountain states and rural areas generally vote against
stringent gun restrictions, including most Republicans and 30 to 40
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Republican nor Democratic party leaders were trying to
make the renegades vote with their party, because of the
recognition that they were making the vote they needed to represent
their district and keep their seat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the bulk of the lobbying attention was focusing on a
particular group of House members caught in a vise: Republicans and
Democrats whose congressional districts encompass both rural areas
and suburbs, forcing them to balance the views of avid gun owners
against those of increasingly militant suburban parents fearful of
school violence.
</P>
<P>
   These 35 or so people _ perhaps 20 Republicans and 15 Democrats
_ will be key to deciding whether the House passes the same kinds
of gun control measures as the Senate did last month or waters down
the restrictions by defeating some of them and putting in place a
less stringent requirement for criminal background checks on
weapons sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday night, Dingell was saying he thought he could draw
a total of more than 40 Democrats to his side, and the gun control
advocates were fearing that as many as 45 Democrats would bolt from
the party. Republican strategists said they thought no more than 35
Republicans would defect to support Mrs. McCarthy's gun show
amendment.

BANFF TV FESTIVAL BESTOWS ITS ROCKIE AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANFF, Alberta _ Where the mountains meet the sky in this part
of Canada, it's as if a huge steak knife were resting against the
blue-plate special of the gods. Patches of white on the steel-gray
serrations could be remnants of horseradish, or maybe heavy cream
sauce the gods can eat because deities don't diet.
</P>
<P>
   The bill of fare is just as rich at the Banff TV Festival, which
each year honors outstanding television productions from around the
world. But while nominees like ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Law &AMP; Order''
may give comfort to someone up from the States, the menu is
actually more like what a first-timer would encounter at a sushi
bar.
</P>
<P>
   It is foreign: This year's field of 952 entries included the
first from Indonesia, as well as productions from Ukraine, Iran and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   It is different: A finalist in the animation category was a
6-minute Australian/German co-production about the lives of rats,
cockroaches and flies, and what happens when the garbage bin in
which they usually dine is empty. (Its take on the old
fly-in-my-soup gag is a classic.)
</P>
<P>
   And, to anyone with an open mind and an adventurous spirit, it
is inspiring: Not everything is A-plus work, but I doubt any of the
81 finalists in 14 categories would fall below a B-plus. As Pat
Ferns, president and CEO of the 20-year-old festival says,
``Quality must be our guide.''
</P>
<P>
   With that uppermost in their minds Monday night, the judges for
the Banff TV Festival bestowed Banff Rockie Awards on an eclectic
group of productions that trace their origins to Austria, Canada,
Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland,
Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The grand prize, symbolic of ``the best television program in
the world,'' went to ``Amongst Women,'' a dark Irish/U.K.
miniseries about an obstinate, repressive widower whose
relationships with his daughters and sons could only be described
as tortured. ``Amongst Women,'' which also won in the miniseries
category, has had limited release as a theatrical film in the
United States, but its TV future in North America is undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time, ``NYPD Blue'' won the Rockie as best
continuing series, while ``Ally McBeal'' took the honor for best
comedy, making it a two-trophy night for prolific creator David E.
Kelley, who also received the festival's annual Astral Award of
Excellence for a body of work that also includes ``Picket Fences,''
``Chicago Hope'' and ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the previous winners of the award, including the
likes of Walter Cronkite, Laurence Olivier and ``60 Minutes''
producer Don Hewitt, were much older than he, Kelley, 43, said he
wasn't sure he was either qualified or worthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to get to do this job 10 or 15 years more,'' he said,
``and that you'll call me up and say, `One just wasn't enough.' But
I'm going to hang onto this one in the meantime.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Bureau, chairman of Astral Communications, Canada's
multichannel equivalent of Turner Broadcasting, said Kelley's
mastery of the human condition combines artistic genius with wry
social commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most of all,'' Bureau said, ``he has invented characters
we care about. This is the mark of a real human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley acknowledged one of those characters, the feisty, wacky
and eminently vulnerable Ally McBeal, has so captured the
imaginations of some viewers that they can't let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Female lawyers come up to me all the time and say, `I am Ally
McBeal, I am Ally McBeal,' '' Kelley remarked. ``I never know
whether to say, `Congratulations,' or, `Get help!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his best advice, something he has said repeatedly to
those who would hold Ally up as a representative of all womankind,
is: ``Please do not take us too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard to say if those words are taken to heart in Canada. ``Ally
McBeal'' gets even better ratings here than in the United States.
But Canadians do know how to laugh, and the festival admits as much
each year with the Peter Ustinov Award, which it bestowed this time
upon favorite son Martin Short.
</P>
<P>
   The other winners of Rockie Awards, by category, were: animation
program, ``Gogs: Gogwana,'' United Kingdom; arts documentary,
``M.C. Escher,'' the Netherlands; children's program,
``Blabbermouth and Sticky Beak,'' United Kingdom; history and
biography program, ``Chronique couleur du ghetto de Lodz,''
France/Poland/Germany; information program, ``Honourable Murder,''
Sweden/Denmark; made-for-TV movie, ``Aharon Cohen's Debt,'' Israel;
performance program, ``Les lecons de tenebres,'' France; popular
science and natural history program, ``Bees _ A Life for the
Queen,'' Austria; short drama, ``The Breakfast (Short Cuts),''
Ireland; social and political documentary, ``True Stories: The
Valley,'' United Kingdom; sports program, ``Hitman Hart: Wrestling
with Shadows,'' Canada/USA/UK/France; special jury prizes, ``Vanity
Fair,'' United Kingdom, and ``Cinema itinerant _ Reves et
illusions,'' Germany/Poland.

scientist, did what has until now been done _ quietly, and
incompletely _ only inside the agency's halls. He succeeded in
breaking almost all of a cipher embedded in a sculpture called
Kryptos _ the Greek word for ``hidden'' _ that was dedicated at the
CIA in October 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 865-character message etched into the sculpture
by the artist, Jim Sanborn, has defied all attempts to completely
unravel its conundrum. Even Gillogly acknowledges that he has
deciphered only its first 768 characters. Still unbroken are the
last 97 characters, apparently the same section that has also
stumped both the CIA and the National Security Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Sanborn said this week that the sculpture contains a riddle
within a riddle _ one that will be solvable only after the four
encrypted passages are known. The complete answer was handed to
William Webster, the director of Central Intelligence when the
sculpture was completed, and has been held in confidence by his
successors.
</P>
<P>
   The tantalizing clues uncovered last week are likely to rekindle
interest in a complete solution: The three sections include a
poetic phrase, a reference to a point near the CIA's headquarters
in Langley, Va. (with the enticing passage, ``Who knows the exact
location? Only WW''), and an excerpt from an account of the opening
of King Tut's tomb in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have a good idea of what it might be,'' said
Gillogly, a 53-year-old cryptographer at Mentat Inc., a Los Angeles
software maker, who started designing cryptograms with his brother
as a child in an attempt to stump their father.
</P>
<P>
   A computer hacker in the best sense of the word and a past
president of the American Cryptogram Association, Gillogly
(pronounced gill-OH-glee) began exploring the Kryptos message in
1992, but he abandoned it until nine days ago, when he saw it
briefly alluded to in an Internet discussion group.
</P>
<P>
   This time he was armed with a better weapon than the pencil and
paper he had seven years ago: his home computer, a highly powered
Pentium II. And the key to solving the first three sections of the
message proved to be a program that Gillogly had written as part of
his cryptographic passion.
</P>
<P>
   The program, he said, is intended to help solve what he refers
to as classical cryptographic systems used by kings, armies and
spies before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Even with more computational power, he had to apply traditional
cryptographic methods, using his logical powers of deduction.
``There was a fair amount of skull sweat,'' he said. ``You work on
it and you see something that is a little out of whack and you
start pulling on it to see what unravels.''
</P>
<P>
   When he contacted the CIA's press office last week, Gillogly
learned that he was not the first codebreaker to succeed at
unraveling the first part of the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   In February, David Stein, who works for the agency as a
physicist and senior analyst, and not as a professional
cryptographer, had quietly uncovered the same three passages. Like
Gillogly, he has been stumped by the final section, although he
believes that it will eventually be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kryptos puzzle is a layered puzzle,'' he said Tuesday,
``and we may find that it has layers within layers within layers.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein sounded a bit miffed when he learned that Gillogly had
used a computer in his pursuit of the hidden codes. ``Kryptos was
meant to be solved with pencil and paper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no written rules in this contest, Gillogly responded.
``As far as I'm concerned a crack is where you find it,'' he said.
``The choice of tool isn't the important part, but rather the
decisions about how to use the tools.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Webster said Tuesday that he had long since
forgotten the answer. ``I have zero memory of this,'' he said. ``It
was philosophical and obscure.'' But he sided with Gillogly on
using a computer. ``Who set the rules here?'' he asked. ``This is
precisely what the agencies do when they try to break codes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanborn, the artist, who has designed a number of sculptures
that are puzzles, has said he believes that the ultimate secret
hidden in the text of Kryptos will never be deciphered. It was
designed by Edward Scheidt, a former chairman of the CIA's
Cryptographic Center.
</P>
<P>
   That has not stopped either Gillogly or Stein from speculating
on what the full message may contain. And Gillogly has even
contemplated exploring the bag of tricks of some of the world's
acknowledged past spy masters in search of the complete solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There're still those last few lines waiting to be decrypted,''
he wrote last week in an Internet discussion group. ``I'll review
the `Mission Impossible' movie for tips on getting into the vault,
if all else fails.''
</P>
<P>
   KRYPTOS UNMASKED
</P>
<P>
   Here are the first three passages of the code on the Kryptos
statue as deciphered by Jim Gillogly, including misspellings (of
``illusion,'' ``underground'' and ``desperately''). The second
passage identifies a location near the CIA headquarters; the third
is taken from Howard Carter's account of the opening of King Tut's
tomb in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   1. Between subtle shading and the absence of light lies the
nuance of iqlusion.
</P>
<P>
   2. It was totally invisible. How's that possible? They used the
earth's magnetic field. x The information was gathered and

</P>
<P>
   3. Slowly, desparatly slowly, the remains of passage debris that
encumbered the lower part of the doorway was removed. With
trembling hands I made a tiny breach in the upper left-hand corner.
And then, widening the hole a little, I inserted the candle and
peered in. The hot air escaping from the chamber caused the flame
to flicker, but presently details of the room within emerged from
the mist. x Can you see anything?

SPURS, KNICK POINT GUARDS OFTEN MALIGNED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Avery Johnson has been released seven times
during his 11-year career. He was out of work when he was wearing
in a tuxedo at David Robinson's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that wasn't the worst,'' the truculent point guard of the
San Antonio Spurs said Tuesday. ``The worst was being cut on
Christmas Eve by Denver in the airport. Paul Westhead came up and
gave me my walking papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On David's day,'' he said, ``I was just really happy for him
and that he was getting married rather than thinking about my own
sad self and how am I going to get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson was bouncing around the National Basketball
Association, Chris Childs had graduated from the Continental
Basketball Association in 1994, and was backing up Kenny Anderson
on the Nets for $60,000 a year. At the same time, across the Hudson
River, Charlie Ward's attempt to show Pat Riley he was more than a
Heisman Trophy winner resulted in fewer minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, you do not need a dazzling crossover dribble, a
catchy nickname or a monster contract to lead your team to the
league championship series. For three unremarkable but effective
floor leaders, the National Basketball Association finals has a
10-year reunion feel to it _ the senior quarterback is bloated, the
class president is divorced and the real movers and shakers from
the unpopular corner of the lunch room get to exact their sweet
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all just wanted a chance,'' said Ward. ``We're not great. I
think we just do the best we can to lead our team. That's all you
can ask for from guys who aren't glamorous, in a sense.''
</P>
<P>
   What did Portland's Damon Stoudamire, outplayed by Johnson in
the Western Conference finals, say about Johnson never being able
to lead his team to the finals? And what of the cocksure Stephon
Marbury who said, ``The Knicks will never win anything with Chris
Childs and Charlie Ward as their point guards?''
</P>
<P>
   Stoudamire re-evaluated his comments from two years ago. Asked
if he felt any vindication in reaching the finals after Marbury's
comments earlier this season, Childs shrugged his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'll say is, I'm practicing and he's chillin,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maligned at home and on the road _ indiscriminately by their
fans and their peers _ either Ward, Childs or Johnson will achieve
the ultimate in their profession over the next two weeks. Given the
litany of criticism, it is an extraordinary feat. But not
unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago won six of the last eight championships with John
Paxson, Ron Harper and B. J. Armstrong running the team at times.
And while it could be said that Michael Jordan played the role of
point guard as well as anyone during the playoffs, Boston did
fairly well with Dennis Johnson and Danny Ainge during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does not matter who is running the team,'' said the
veteran reserve center Herb Williams. ``Who's a basketball critic
that can accurately predict the future? I mean, how may great point
guards did Chicago have? How many great point guards did Boston
have? You get a great point guard and you don't have anyone else to
get you over the top, you have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys do what they do to help their teams win. With all
the scoring and highlights these days, some people forget that
that's what a point guard's job used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ward: ``You look at the point guards that have been in the
finals recently. John Stockton has been the league for a long time,
but he's not a top scorer anymore. He's not very flashy. He plays
hard, does what he has to do. That's all that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt a sense of satisfaction after all the
criticism, he added, ``I'm not in the business of trying to verify
what I do. I go out and play to the best of my abilities. I don't
doubt myself. Other people doubt me. I'm just very grateful God has
placed me where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward has been spotty during the post-season, but whenever he has
faltered Childs has been there. His defense on Mark Jackson and
Reggie Miller at times during the Knicks' victory over Indiana in
the Eastern Conference finals was as instrumental as any clutch
3-pointer he knocked down.
</P>
<P>
   Ornery, ruthless and sometimes an annoying chatterbox, Johnson
brings a serated edge to the court. He draws parallels between
Childs and Greg Anthony, the reserve Portland point guard who
disrupted John Stockton in the second round and hawks the ball from
end line to end line.
</P>
<P>
   For all his liabilities as a consistent jump-shooter, Johnson is
respected by Childs and Ward for his ability to break defenses down
with his hesitation moves and his skill going to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   As Game 1 looms on Wednesday night, they seemed to have formed a
three-person support group: Persevering Point Guards Whose Fans
Still Want Them Traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criticism will never stop,'' Ward said. ``That's just the
nature of this job. The only thing you can do is not listen to it
and believe in yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Johnson: ``I still feel like I'm going up the side of the
mountain and have a long way to go. If you're fortunate enough to
have success this year, you want to come back and show you can do
it again.'' &QL;

IN THE WOODS OF GEORGIA, ECHOES OF BALKAN TERROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMER, Ga. _ Hysnije Hoxha was studying the arrangement of
spoons, fruits and other objects on a wooden table last week as her
English teacher, Catherine Giller, circled vegetables around a
wristwatch. ``Hysni,'' Ms. Giller asked, ``where is the watch?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hoxha, a refugee from Kosovo, was learning English at the
age of 45, but under the surface of her concentration swam visions
of her two sisters and her brother _ stranded with their families
in the mountains of Kosovo, surrounded until now by Serbian troops.
``The watch,'' Mrs. Hoxha said haltingly, ``is in the middle of
vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Giller turned to Mrs. Hoxha's husband, Ilir, and asked him
the color of his house. Hoxha (pronounced HO-jah) did not mention
his two-story, four-bedroom pride of Pristina, turned into a
station for the Serbian military and now probably booby-trapped or
burned. Instead, he described the cabin here in the Georgia woods
where he is staying with his family. ``My house is black,'' he
said, and then corrected himself. ``My house is blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the subject is prepositions or predicates, the Hoxhas
and their three children _ their son, Arben, 20, and their
daughters, Arbresha, 17, and Teuta, 15 _ are caught between worlds.
They study the language of their new home, even if they are not
sure where home will ultimately be. A month ago it was a barracks
at Fort Dix, N.J., where they were among the first refugees from
Macedonia. Two months from now, home will probably be in Atlanta.
Or it may be back in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, in a house
either familiar or beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   For now, home is just outside Comer, northeast of the university
town of Athens, in a quiet compound built 20 years ago by a group
of Christian pacifists called the Jubilee Partners, who have
dedicated themselves to easing refugees into American life. It is
here that the Hoxhas, their world turned completely upside down,
have wound up along with Ali and Raze Beshiri, neighbors and close
friends from Pristina, and three other Kosovar families. They are
to stay for two months before heading for Atlanta, where they will
be resettled if they remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Daily, almost hourly, the grapevine news from Kosovo changes,
elating the refugees one moment and crushing their spirits the
next.
</P>
<P>
   When she heard that the Yugoslav army was withdrawing from
Kosovo, Arbresha's reaction was typically American: she threw up
her right palm for a high-five with Kosovare Ramadani, a friend she
had met at Fort Dix. Ilir Hoxha sang softly about his homeland, and
the girls joined in.
</P>
<P>
   But their song had barely ended when another of the Kosovar
families received a call from Switzerland relaying a rumor that the
army was torching Pristina as it pulled out. Hoxha, a former music
producer, held his head in his hands. ``Today all our hope is
destroyed,'' he said. ``We thought of going home, but this news is
very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hoxhas learned that they would be going to Atlanta only a
day before they took the plane south from Newark (N.J.)
International Airport. During the two-hour flight, Hysnije and Ilir
wondered how they would make their way through the Atlanta airport
and where they would live. ``I was afraid I would not meet any
Albanians at all,'' Hoxha said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the presence in Georgia of another Kosovar Albanian, a
scientist who volunteered to translate for the Hoxhas, that had
opened the way for the Jubilee Partners to bring them here. When he
learned that refugees would be leaving Fort Dix for resettlement
around the United States, he called Jubilee Partners and
volunteered to translate, making it easier for the group to
accommodate them. The scientist, who does not want to be identified
because he still has relatives in Kosovo and fears for their
safety, welcomed the Hoxhas at the Atlanta airport. So did
reporters and television crews.
</P>
<P>
   But the isolation of the compound's woods was hard to bear.
Arbresha was haunted by the memory of Serbs' kicking in the door
and separating the women in the family from her father and Arben.
The others could not name their fear, though it was undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   That reaction was not unusual, said Jennifer Drago, who is in
charge of helping the Kosovars at Jubilee and who notes that the
woods can echo newly arrived refugees' nightmares: The Vietnamese
of the early 1980s feared tigers. The Bosnians feared land mines.
On their first night here, Ms. Drago said, many women weep
themselves to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee Partners will sign up the Hoxhas and other Kosovars for
food stamps and medical assistance. It gives them $20 a person each
week, part of a one-time $740-a-person resettlement grant that the
United States government pays resettlement agencies. The payments,
while minimal, are comparable to those given to members and
volunteers of Jubilee Partners, each of whom lives on $10 a week
and has no group medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee's two dozen or so members are largely people who have
left mainstream society to work here, on the grounds of a former
cow pasture, and live in simplicity, eating no meat, wearing
hand-me-downs and shunning conveniences like television. The
group's founder, Don Mosley, also founded Habitat for Humanity, the
charity that builds and repairs homes for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Hoxha says he has no plans to take his family back to Kosovo
now. The Hoxhas are all but penniless and fear that returning
prematurely could land them in danger or desperation. But while the
Hoxhas' energies are devoted to preparing for life in America,
their hearts remain back home. ``I'm trying to prepare for the
future, but the reality is that I'm living in the past,'' Hoxha
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most obviously affected by the trauma of exile is the
17-year-old, Arbresha. She no longer lowers her head as she did
despondently after her arrival at Fort Dix in early May. But she is
having trouble sleeping, and cries easily.
</P>
<P>
   Arbresha has begun to keep a diary of the past, recounting the
horrors of Kosovo. But much of the diary is written as if the
horrors have not ended. In Albanian, she describes hiding in the
cellar, and getting word that the Serbs are advancing neighborhood
by neighborhood, marching the Kosovars out of their province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can feel death before our eyes, all around us,'' says a
passage read by the scientist-translator who has linked up with
Jubilee Partners. ``We think the worst will come later. The
telephone rings, and we learn that another neighborhood is being
cleaned.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon she sees people who are ``the heart of the neighborhood''
being marched out of their homes, with masked members of the
Serbian paramilitary behind them. ``We started to put on our shoes,
and a soldier kicked in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The soldiers separated me, Mom and Teuta from Dad and Arben,''
she wrote. The Serbs held guns under the chins of Hoxha and Arben,
demanding money they did not have, while the women stood outside
imagining the worst. ``I prayed to God to save them,'' Arbresha
wrote. Why should she march out of the city if her father and
brother were killed? ``I should just die here,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It was a five-minute eternity before her father and brother
reappeared. Arbresha wept. ``I looked at my house for the last
time,'' she wrote, ``and at my whole neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The translator looked up. Around the table, the Hoxhas were
sobbing, as were their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is enough,'' the translator said as tears rolled down his
cheeks as well. ``We will save the rest for next time.''

JUBILANTG KOSOVAR REFUGEES BEGIN A TREK TOWARD HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORINI, Albania _ More than 5,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees
began a jubilant exodus back home on Tuesday through this mountain
border crossing controlled jointly by the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the rebel group that fought Serbian forces in Kosovo, and NATO
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my life have I been so happy,'' said Opoja Piraj, 36,
who had come through the same crossing on April 2 devastated and
terrified after Serbian police expelled him from his house in
northern Kosovo at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Wildly honking cars, trucks and tractors filled with exuberant
adults and children waving two-fingered victory signs _ a stunning
contrast to the tears and shock of the refugees' arrival here three
months ago _ snaked up a crumbling mountain road to a re-entry that
was, at least on Tuesday, remarkably speedy because of the
participation of the rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   Although the guerrillas' central role at the border was awkward
for the German NATO troops, who are supposed to be protecting both
Kosovar Albanians and Serbs, the Germans acknowledged that the
rebels made the re-entry of the refugees, most of whom were
stripped of all identity papers by the Serbs, efficient and
trouble-free, for now.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, as armed German soldiers stood by, a
23-year-old member of the rebel group, dressed in blue trousers, a
blue sweater and Nikes, stopped each car at the border, asked not
for identity papers, but quickly took down in a spiral notebook the
Albanian names, dates of birth and places of residence of the
people inside _ essential information for NATO, refugee agencies
and future aid to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can do it faster than we can do it,'' said a Lieutenant
Colonel Eder, who was in command of the German forces at the border
crossing, and said that rebel leaders were at that moment meeting
with German authorities in the nearby Kosovar town of Prizren to
determine how to divide up authority at the border. On Tuesday
evening, the colonel said that the arrangement reached at the
meeting was that ``NATO takes over the border, but we will use the
rebels for administrative things, like writing down the names. It's
very hard for us to write down the names.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, this was exactly the same operation that had gone on
all day, although NATO was to raise its flag over the post on
Tuesday night. ``Perhaps they saw if they cooperated with us it
will be easier,'' said Bujar Bajraktari, who described himself as
the rebel commander in charge of the border post and who kept a
close watch on the proceedings here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO-rebel cooperation was evident in a conversation in
German that Bajraktari had on Tuesday afternoon with Eder, who told
Bajraktari that NATO wanted the rebel lists of the returning
Kosovar Albanians so that NATO could give them to the office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The border opened in
chaos to the news media on Sunday, was closed to the media and
refugees for part of Monday because of the presence of armed
Serbian troops just a few miles up the road in Kosovo, but opened
again at 6 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were some Albanian policemen at the border
crossing, their role was to open the first gate and let every car
up to the rebel-NATO checkpoint without asking questions. It fell
to the rebels to separate out the Kosovar Albanians from the local
Albanians in this anarchic border region, where recreational
gunfire from nearby Albanian villages rings out all day.
</P>
<P>
   Many local Albanians have slipped through the border since
Sunday to loot homes in Kosovo before the refugees themselves
return. On Tuesday, the rebels were preventing the local Albanians
from crossing into Kosovo, on the orders, they said, of the
Albanian police. The rebels were also checking the cars of local
Albanians crossing back from Kosovo into Albania, and roughly
questioning those whose cars contained large boxes and packages.
</P>
<P>
   They were able to distinguish one kind of Albanian from the
other by dialect, license plates, or both. There was not a single
Serbian authority at the Morini crossing, even though the NATO
peace agreement calls for a ``Serbian presence'' at the borders as
refugees re-enter. ``We don't mind a Serbian presence as long as
they have no say in who gets in,'' said Kris Janowski, a spokesman
for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Janowski said that the refugee agency, which has repeatedly
warned returning Kosovars about rushing back too soon before land
mines and Serbian troops are cleared, said that he would prefer the
return to be ``a bit slower,'' but that it was going smoothly for
now.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers said on Tuesday morning that they wanted to wait
three weeks before starting to move the nearly half million
refugees out of Albania. But refugees, reacting to the news of
people dancing in the streets of Prizren, NATO's growing presence
in Kosovo, and the cars leaving Kukes on Tuesday, were packing up
in the camps near here on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw that a lot of people are going,'' said Nazlije Gashi,
59, who was riding with her family in the back of truck toward the
border and home. ``So we decided to go with them.''

   WITH SILICON VALLEY BOUNTY COMES UNEASE ABOUT BOOM
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, the nation's high-technology heartland, the
good times have arrived in abundance and have stayed longer than
ever before. Wage rates are about 60 percent above the national
average and are growing far more quickly than average, and the
trappings of wealth can be seen everywhere. But the indicators of
affluence have in turn led to a growing sense of unease among many
valley longtimers who oscillate between a faith in what has been
called the ``long boom'' and the knowledge that each of the
valley's booms in the last half-century has inevitably been
followed by a bust.

GARBAGE DISPOSAL IS AN ECONOMIC PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Sunday's Parade story on garbage showed why
Americans have so much trouble solving basic problems.
</P>
<P>
   The cover photo of a family surrounded by a month's trash
production proclaimed, ``We're running out of ways to dispose of
it.'' The story, however, didn't much explore that premise.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed solutions included more recycling and less superfluous
packaging. The effort thus not only failed to break new ground, but
also recycled the same old feel-good panaceas.
</P>
<P>
   These stories fail to bring fresh perspectives because they
ignore the reality that trash is an economic problem, which means
costly and inconvenient trade-offs. This isn't what most Americans
want to hear, which locks analysts into tired old ways of
considering the problem.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, think about the claim, ``We're running out of ways
to deal with it.'' This simply isn't so. The options have always
been limited. Since societies became civilized enough to worry
about sanitary garbage disposal, the primary choices have been to
bury it, burn it or reuse it.
</P>
<P>
   What interferes mostly with America's quest to deal with garbage
is an aversion to acknowledging that the problem isn't trash per
se, but the cost of disposing of it at acceptable locations.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the Parade article was
its inclusion of William Rathje to no enlightening effect. Rathje
is America's foremost expert on garbology. His 1992 book, Rubbish,
remains the most insightful work on the issue, but it has never
been much embraced by environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   While the article did feature Rathje, it used him to discuss
only the archaeology of garbage rather than focus on his insights
into what he considers the best solutions. He was quoted, for
instance, about the durability of garbage, including the
mummification of hot dogs still recookable after 30 years in a
landfill. There was no discussion, though, of how he would deal
with trash.
</P>
<P>
   By using Rathje to titillate rather than inform, the article
ignored the most useful advice in his book, which was to understand
that ``we do not necessarily know the things we think we know.''
Another admonition in Rubbish was for Americans to be willing to
pay for garbage disposal.
</P>
<P>
   If Americans don't want garbage buried near them, they must pay
for this convenience. Contrary to what many experts say, it's not a
matter of running out of room. It's a matter of paying whatever's
necessary to use space far removed from everyone's back yard.
</P>
<P>
   For example, according to Rathje's estimates, ``all of America's
garbage for the next 1,000 years would fit into a landfill space
120 feet deep and 44 miles square ... less than 0.1 percent of the
surface area of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting it all in one isolated place obviously isn't realistic,
but it illustrates that space isn't the problem. The real problem
is America's unwillingness to pay the price of ridding itself of
the mountains of refuse created daily by America's humongous
propensity for consumption.
</P>
<P>
   A new challenge? Not at all. In 1889, Washington's chief health
officer warned that ``appropriate places for garbage are becoming
scarcer ... already inhabitants in proximity to the public dumps
are beginning to complain.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Oracle to Lay Off 325 in U.S.  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Oracle Corp. said yesterday that it will lay off about 325
employees, including an undisclosed number of workers in the Bay
Area, as it trims its operations and shifts more of its business
online.
<P>
   The No. 1 database software-maker announced the cuts just hours
before releasing record fourth-quarter and year-end earnings that
exceeded analyst expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs, which will affect less than 1 percent of Oracle's
43,000 employees, will be spread across the company's departments,
said Jennifer Glass, an Oracle spokeswoman. Glass could not say how
many workers in Silicon Valley would be affected but said most of
the cuts will take place at Oracle's U.S. operations.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison pledged to cut
$1 billion in costs during over  &LR; the next 18 months to make his
company more efficient. One way he plans to achieve that is by
moving much of Oracle's day-to-day business online and selling more
products over the Web, a move Glass said will reduce the need for
some personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison reiterated his commitment to becoming an e-business
yesterday while announcing stronger-than-expected financial
results.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said net income for the fiscal fourth-quarter rose to
$527.4 million (36 cents per share), up from $402.8 million (27
cents) from the same period a year ago. Revenue increased 22
percent to $2.94 billion from $2.41 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company credited increased sales in its database and
applications software for the revenue growth. The fourth-quarter
earnings surprised Wall Street, which had predicted earnings of
about 32 cents per share, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were expecting a somewhat disappointing quarter from
Oracle because of a slowdown in the software market. Many
corporations have been postponing software purchases until after
the year Year  &LR; 2000. Companies have been concentrating on
preventing Y2K problems instead of buying the database and
applications software that Oracle and other companies sell.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Henley, Oracle's chief financial officer, said the Y2K
slowdown was not as much of an issue as some had feared but
cautioned that there are still six months left in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Year 2000 is still out there. We're halfway through the
calendar year, but the industry isn't quite sure what will happen
as we move through this year,'' Henley said. ``However, we don't
see anything that leads us to believe (the first) quarter is
slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   The company also had a strong fiscal year overall. Earnings for
the fiscal year ended May 31 were up 58.5 percent to $1.29 billion
(87 cents per share), compared to $813.7 million (54 cents) a year
ago. Revenue was also up 24 percent to $8.83 billion from $7.14
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said Oracle's database software sales are stronger than
those of such rivals as Microsoft and IBM and predicted the company
would continue to snatch market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need to use any Oracle application is a standard
Internet browser,'' Ellison said. ``In contrast, all of our
competitors (with the exception of Ariba, a database software
competitor) still sell older, more costly client-server
technology.'' Ellison said Oracle is also outselling Ariba in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to strong growth in software license revenue, which
was 22 percent higher than last year's fourth quarter. New sales of
database software rose 21 percent to $1.21 billion from $993.5
million a year ago, while database services revenues increased 21
percent to $971 million from $802.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings were released after financial markets closed
yesterday while the layoffs were disclosed during trading. Oracle
stock slumped 5 percent, closing at $25.13 a share on the Nasdaq
Stock Market, down $1.31 for the day.

COMMENTARY: THE SON ALSO TALKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Al Gore is the Tin Man: immobile, rusting,
decent, badly in need of that oil can.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is the Scarecrow: charming, limber, cocky,
fidgety, seeking to stuff his head with a few more weighty
thoughts. (Dan Quayle and Gary Bauer are, of course, the Flying
Monkeys.)
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is so feminized and diversified and ecologically
correct, he's practically lactating.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush is all swagger, with macho campaign (accessories) of
custom-made ostrich-leather black cowboy boots with ``G.W.B.''
emblazoned, and a huge belt buckle with ``Gov. George W. Bush,''
and baseball statistics, and pork and beans, and a Betty Crocker
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the ``I am worthy, Daddy'' Freudian face-off of
dauphins named after famous fathers and shaped by strong mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Al is the Good Son, the early-achieving scion from Harvard and
Tennessee who always thought he would be president. (So did his
parents.) George is the Prodigal Son, the late-blooming scion from
Yale and Texas who never thought he would be President. (Neither
did his parents.)
</P>
<P>
   As the robotic, plodding Gore tries to loosen up, the loose,
quicksilver Bush tries to stay robotically on message.
</P>
<P>
   The subtext of the Bush campaign is: What Bill Clinton did with
Monica stinks; I was raised right and you can count on me to behave
with more dignity. The subtext of the Gore campaign is the same.
</P>
<P>
   You don't often get to see a presidential candidate bloom right
before your eyes. But as W. debuted in Iowa and New Hampshire,
Republicans, Democrats and journalists realized that he might just
pull it off, at the same time he realized it, at the same time his
parents, who had long assumed it would be Jeb, realized it.
</P>
<P>
   As late as Christmas, W. said, he was 50-50 about running. As
late as last week, he was nervous. On Sunday, when we talked by the
sparkling Atlantic on the back porch of the family home in
Kennebunkport, W. wore an Astros T-shirt and a big grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you,'' he said, ``is I was fairly anxious for
the week leading up to this, but when I got up there in Cedar
Rapids, it felt good. I think that's an interesting measurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, people out there, they're looking for
something _ dignity, integrity, optimism, big themes. I know what I
believe in. I believe the big issues are going to be China and
Russia. There will be moments when situations, incidents will flare
up. It's important for the president to think globally. But in the
long run, security in the world is going to be how do we deal with
China and how do we deal with Russia. People think the Russian
situation, or used to think, Russia was not an issue. It's a huge
issue. But if the East Timorians decide to revolt, I'm sure I'll
have a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement, one hopes, will call them the East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's important for you to know is that I feel I know
what to do,'' he continued. ``I really do. I may not be able to
tell you exactly the nuance of the East Timorian situation but I'll
ask Condy Rice or I'll ask Paul Wolfowitz or I'll ask Dick Cheney.
I'll ask the people who've had experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm smart enough to know what I don't know and I have good
judgment about who will either be telling me the truth or has got
some agenda that is not a right agenda. And I'm tough enough to
tell somebody to kiss off if they're trying to put one over on me
or on the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few short years, the Prodigal Son has become a popular
politician, deft at working a room and skilled at domestic
politics. But all those years that his father was so deeply engaged
in world affairs, W. was still finding himself. So now he's
starting from scratch, getting coached on foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   W.'s father tried to reassure reporters on this matter by saying
that his son has a good issues team. But you kind of want the
President to be past the point of tutorials.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Son, who was applying himself while his rival was
finding himself, is not green. But he is beige, and so puckered in
his pronouncements that his Hollywood pals want to coach him on how
to talk to people.
</P>
<P>
   One knows his subjects cold but can't heat up an audience. The
other promises the global vision thing as soon as he gets his
geography down.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be an interesting year, Toto.

U.S. OFFERING COMPROMISES ON ROLE OF RUSSIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-RUSSIA; note byline change from early budgets) 
(mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ In an effort to break an impasse over how Russian
troops will operate in Kosovo, Secretary of Defense William Cohen
is to suggest to his Russian counterpart that the troops be
allotted an ``area of responsibility'' within one of the five
established NATO sectors, administration officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also plans to propose a command structure that he hopes
will satisfy the Russians' demand that their troops not report
directly to an allied commander, but will not violate NATO's
insistence on a unified command for the entire security force, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and his counterpart, Igor Sergeyev, are to meet in
Helsinki, Finland, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is bringing two possible compromises on the sensitive
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that the Russians report to a commander from a
neutral, non-NATO country, like Sweden or Finland, an
administration official said. This commander would report to a more
senior NATO officer.
</P>
<P>
   The other possibility is that the Russians duplicate the pattern
used in Bosnia, where Russian troops operate in the American sector
and report to an American commander. He in turn reports to a
Russian liaison officer at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of involving Cohen and Sergeyev in the talks _ and
moving the dispute away from diplomats _ came from the Russians, an
administration official said, after Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott and the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov,
failed to come to a solution over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But on the eve of the defense secretaries' talks, senior NATO
military commanders are concerned that the political need to keep
good relations with Russia will interfere with the allies' military
need to insure control over the peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance will not be represented during the talks. Instead,
the NATO secretary-general, Javier Solana, and the alliance's top
military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, will be kept informed by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, this is an administration that prides itself on
constructive engagement with Russia,'' a senior NATO official said
Tuesday. ``These administration officials do not wish to
acknowledge that Russian high officials have been stringing them
along all week.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said: ``It doesn't
seem to me we're sweeping this under the rug _ quite the contrary.
We are spending a lot of time and high-level energy and so are the
Russians on this issue. That's a sign we want a solution that's
good for the Russians and for NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff has touched a raw nerve in the administration, and
not only because the surprise arrival of Russian troops at the
airport in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, robbed NATO of a grand
entry into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying concern, administration officials assert, is that
while Russian involvement is welcome, it is welcome on grounds that
do not subvert two administration goals: that there be no partition
of Kosovo and that the allies maintain a unified command of all
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing that the Russians take an ``area of responsibility''
and the proposed command structure, Cohen will not cross the ``red
lines'' of partition and unified command, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``area of responsibility'' for Russia _ most likely in the
north and thus most likely in the French zone, where there is the
largest concentration of Serb civilians _ would have a
concentration of Russian troops but allied forces would be able to
come and go, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   The session in Helsinki comes as President Clinton arrives here
for the start of a six-day European trip, including a meeting with
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia on Sunday in Cologne, Germany.
The two presidents have spoken on the phone three times in three
days, a rare number of back-to-back calls and a measure of the
volatility of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The administration would like to have the Russian role settled
by Sunday so the men can publicly embrace a deal at a summit
meeting of the seven major industrial nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians showed no signs Tuesday of leaving the Pristina
airport; indeed, a convoy of 11 vehicles is en route from Bosnia to
resupply the approximately 200 Russians in Pristina with fuel and
food.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO officials said they were encouraged that this time the
Russians requested permission from the NATO commanders in Bosnia to
leave their posts and take the supplies. Last week, when the convoy
of Russians left Bosnia for Kosovo, they did so without informing
the commanders in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected fuss over the Russian troops was in part a price
to be paid for the help that Moscow provided Washington in getting
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to accept a withdrawal
from Kosovo, allied officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear how high the price will be, or which faction
in the Russian political elite will be decisive in reacting to
Cohen's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians have always made it clear that their main
objective in Kosovo is to protect the Serbs, an administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The largest concentration of Serbs is in the north, the area
monitored by the French. The British military control a sector
centered on Pristina, and the Americans are operating a zone in the
southeast. Germany and Italy are moving into two other sectors, in
the south and west.
</P>
<P>
   Another interest for the Russians, according to officials, is to
protect what is left of the the economic interests of the Serbs in
Kosovo. The Trepca smelting complex, which includes the Stari Trg
lead and zinc mines, is in northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   By giving the Russians an area of responsibility inside a
NATO-led zone, administration officials argue, their presence
should not deter the return of Albanian refugees. Many refugees
have told officials of the U.N. high commissioner for refugees that
they would not go back to their homes if Russian troops were
patrolling where they lived.
</P>
<P>
   But in any area where a lot of Serbs are still living, the
return of Albanians is unlikely anyway, one administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is also not clear how big the ``area'' for Russia would be. A
realistic number of Russian soldiers for Kosovo is in the vicinity
of ``several thousand,'' so the area would have to be
``decent-sized,'' the official said.

 Senate OKs Limits On Y2K Lawsuits  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The Senate handed Silicon Valley an important win yesterday by
handily passing legislation protecting companies from lawsuits
stemming from the Year 2000 computer problem.
<P>
   High-tech firms are eager to head off a flood of lawsuits that
could top an unprecedented $1 trillion in damages if computers run
amok next year. However, the industry still has to overcome a
threatened veto from the White House, which objects the bill erodes
the legal rights of consumers and reduces pressure on computer
companies to solve Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-to-37 vote fell five votes short of the two-thirds
majority needed for the ``veto-proof'' bill some high-tech industry
supporters were predicting last week.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, by Republican presidential hopeful John McCain
of Arizona, would delay the filing of Y2K lawsuits during a 30- to
90-day cooling-off period, make it harder for consumers to file
suits if their computers crash and limit punitive damages in
certain cases.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; House Version Differs
</P>
<P>
   The bill now goes to a congressional conference committee to
reconcile differences between the Senate version and one passed by
the House on May 12.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech leaders fear the White House will try to water down
the bill. The industry wants to protect a provision that would hold
companies liable only for the losses they caused, not for damages
attributable to suppliers or others.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, companies that are held responsible for a
portion of damages can be forced to pay the entire amount, which
could inspire a rash of lawsuits against ``deep pocket'' firms like
Microsoft and Intel, even if they had only marginal responsibility
for a Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant victory, but the key is now the role of
the White House,'' said Bill Calder, spokesman for Intel, the Santa
Clara chipmaker that has been one of the major proponents of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be able to try to get through this without a flood
of frivolous lawsuits and so far, the White House has not indicated
they are going to support high technology,'' Calder said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Software Problem
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem stems from a widely used software programming
shortcut that may cause computer systems to crash because they
don't recognizing dates on Jan. 1, 2000, and afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Flexing their new-found political muscle, computer firms made
passage of the bill their top legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
   The industry framed the issue as a vote for or against high
tech, and it aligned support from a wide array of business
interests, from retailers to manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had the support of 12 Democrats and 50 Republicans,
with 33 Democrats and four Republicans voting against it.
California's two Democratic senators were split on the vote, with
Dianne Feinstein voting yes and Barbara Boxer voting no.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still haven't won,'' said Marc Pearl, general counsel for
the Information Technology Association of America, the trade group
leading lobbying efforts for the bill. ``When we went into this, it
was viewed as an information technology bill. In essence, it became
a pro-business bill, it became a pro-economy bill.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; `Laundry List'
</P>
<P>
   Pearl said the White House has signaled that it wants to include
language requiring companies to go through ``a laundry list of
steps'' to prove they did everything possible to avoid Y2K
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's opponents warned that it will hurt consumers. Joan
Mulhern of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, told the
Associated Press that the bill ``is clearly just a special interest
giveaway to the high-tech and business lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., the most vocal opponent of the
legislation, told reporters Congress was moving to ``do away with
200 years of liability law at the state level'' in the chase for
political donations from the business and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate versions of the bill would place
limits on lawsuits and damages, although the House version is
regarded as stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's version would limit punitive damages to $250,000
for companies with 50 or fewer employees. The House version
includes a general $250,000 punitive damages cap and routes all Y2K
class action suits to federal courts instead of state courts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Lawyer Calls Bill Unnecessary
</P>
<P>
   Curtis E.A. Karnow, a San Francisco attorney handling Y2K cases
for the firm Sonnenschein, Nath and Rosenthal, said the bill is
unnecessary because current tort laws give businesses enough
protections from frivolous Y2K claims.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the proposed legislation leaves enough loopholes
for lawyers to file Y2K liability suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have an umbrella there, lawyers will see it as their
job to find a way to get out from under the umbrella,'' Karnow
said.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley is making no secret that a White House veto could
turn the Y2K bill into a Year 2000 campaign headache for Vice
President Al Gore, who is courting the technology industry for
support in his bid for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely important issue for us now,'' said Intel's
Calder. ``We're counting on Vice President Gore and the White House
to come to the table and declare their support for the bill that
was passed today, in its current form.''

</HEADLINE>
 A BUSINESS _ SF CHRON   Quietly Publicizing the Sale of a Business 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: &LR;  I have a successful business and am interested in tips on how &LR; 
 &LR; to sell it in a most confidential way. &LR;
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Selling a business definitely can be tricky. You want to
get out the word and attract the highest price. But you don't want
to scare off customers, employees and suppliers or expose them to
attack from sharklike rivals.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco business consultant Paul Terry offers some advice.
Most small businesses that sell out are acquired by employees,
competitors or others within their industry. One way to contact
potential outside buyers is to enlist the help of an accountant,
attorney, consultant, insurance or business broker or other
intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   Have them make quiet referrals. They should provide enough
information to prospective buyers to gauge their interest but not
enough to give them a blueprint on how to raid your clientele or
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is to advertise discretely in a trade magazine,
business opportunity section of the classified ads, or online.
However, you probably won't want to provide the exact name or
location of your enterprise at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important rules of selling a business is to
``run it as if it were not being sold,'' says Terry. Owners who
forget to mind the store they are selling often end up with less
business and a lower sales price.
</P>
<P>
   If employees hear that you plan to sell the business before you
are ready to tell them, there are ways to provide an answer without
going into all the details. Terry suggests that you might say the
business is always open to buyout offers for the right price.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, too, that the new owners most likely are paying for a
successful operating business, not just the assets. That includes
talented employees and your customer relationships.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Liability Coverage
</P>
<P>
   Q: I work on design services and project management as a
subcontractor for architecture and engineering firms. What are my
professional liability-insurance requirements?
</P>
<P>
   A: In many cases, the prime contractors (the firms you work for)
have their own liability insurance requirements. Or their customers
mandate a certain amount of coverage. You might check with them.
</P>
<P>
   There is no law that you must have your own insurance. But for
peace of mind and protection of your assets, insurance experts
suggest that you should have your own professional liability
coverage, often called errors and omission insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Merriwether, CEO of Merriwether &AMP; Williams Insurance
Services in San Francisco, often recommends that consultants such
as yourself take out coverage of at least $1 million. If you are
sued for errors or omissions in your work, you would be covered for
legal costs as well as claims. Insurance premiums often are based
on your revenues. If your annual gross receipts are about $100,000,
Merriwether suggests that the yearly premium for a $1 million
policy would be about $2,200.
</P>
<P>
   You also might want general liability coverage to protect you
from personal injury and property damage claims. This might cost an
additional $500 to $750.
</P>
<P>
   For best rates, check with the American Institute of Architects
or other industry organizations with which you may be associated.
These typically refer members to carriers with the appropriate
coverage at favorable rates.
</P>
<P>
   You also can check with independent insurance agents in the
phone book or associations such as the Independent Insurance Agents
of America in Alexandria, Va.  &LR; (www.independentagent.com). &LR;  This
Web site also offers a guide to small-business insurance.

 Herbal Wellness Is Big Business  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Second-grade teacher Victoria Knight-McDowell got so sick of
catching colds from her students in Salinas that she and her
husband developed effervescent tablets from Chinese herbs and other
ingredients to help ward off germs and viruses.
<P>
   Commercial sales of their first effort, fittingly called
Airborne, have done so well that their company plans to introduce
other formulations, including herbally laced ice pops for kids.
</P>
<P>
   Airborne is not the only herbal product to take off recently.
Other so-called ``eco-entrepreneurs'' are jumping on the herbal
bandwagon. In Sausalito, for instance, chiropractor David Schanaker
and his wife Erika Trice-Schanaker  &LR; have cooked up a new type of
high-energy snack called Bodhi Bar with therapeutic doses of roots
and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   And near Santa Cruz, Brian Lovejoy, a former Odwalla fruit juice
designer, has created DrinksThatWork, which packs a similar
botanical punch.
</P>
<P>
   Northern California has long been a mecca for fresh ideas and
organic products free of man-made chemicals. Now it is playing an
important role in the so-called herbal renaissance movement of the
1990s, where roots and herbs increasingly are being added to
products for their reputed, but not always proven, health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the market for health foods and vitamin, herbal
and other supplements has shifted during over  &LR; the past three
decades from ``health fanatics, body builders and `crunchy granola'
types'' to a much broader group of consumers, said David Wright, a
director of the Hartman Group in Bellevue, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Driving this new ``green'' mainstream is the aging population,
changing attitudes about food (from getting enough to getting the
right stuff) as well as increasing interest in alternative medicine
and warding off illness.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is certainly evident in the rising sales of herbal
products. While overall food sales grew only about 2 percent last
year, natural food sales were up 8 percent and organic food sales
were up 14 percent., according to Nutrition Business Journal in San
Diego. Meanwhile, sales of botanical and dietary supplements soared
33 percent, which was double the 1997 growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Experts at Natural Business Communications' third annual
investment and market trends conference in Berkeley last week also
made these observations about this fast-growing market segment:
</P>
<P>
   _Natural products companies raised about $1 billion in public
offerings last year, five times as much as they did in 1997, and
there were 65 mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   _Mainstream food vendors such as General Mills, Kellogg, Lipton
and Pillsbury are launching their own natural products.
</P>
<P>
   _Major pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer, Unilever and
Warner-Lambert are entering the less-regulated dietary supplement
market. Last week, Warner-Lambert took a minority stake in San
Francisco's Healthshop.com, a leading Web site for natural health
products and information.
</P>
<P>
   _There are now about 1,300 1300  &LR; companies in natural foods,
beverages and supplements, including more than 30 online
specialists. Total U.S. revenues top $23 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new buzzwords are ``nutraceuticals,'' which refers to
food, drinks and supplements purchased primarily for health
reasons, and ``functional foods,'' which are fortified with
botanical ingredients to provide health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Popular functional ingredients include ginseng, ginkgo biloba,
echinacea, goldenseal, Saint-John's-wort St. John' wort &LR;   &LR; and kava,
a Polynesian root used for ceremonial and medicinal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Bodhi Bar of Sausalito is taking its energy bar to new and
pricier levels. In addition to the usual organic nuts, fruits and
seeds, the Bodhi Bar throws in what the owners call therapeutic
doses of ``adaptogenic'' (stress-reducing) herbs such as Siberian
ginseng, astragalus and schizandra.
</P>
<P>
   The gritty-tasting bars sell for $1.75 to $1.89 retail and come
in three flavors: pineapple ginger ginseng, cardamom mango
astragalus and schizandra cherry ginseng.
</P>
<P>
   The company was started two years ago by David  &LR; Schanaker, 42,
and his wife, Erika Trice-Schanaker, 35. Their aim was to produce a
new natural food bar that in addition to providing a shot of energy
was easy to digest, could relieve stress, strengthen the immune
system and perform other feats.
</P>
<P>
   Bodhi Bars are manufactured by Barbara's Bakery in Sacramento
and are sold at Whole Foods, Molly Stone, Raley's and other
outlets. The company produces about 60,000 bars a month and is
developing new products, including a calcium-rich bar designed for
women and gel packs with a shot of herbal elixir.
</P>
<P>
   Another local herbal startup is DrinksThatWork. The company was
started two years ago by Brian  &LR; Lovejoy, the former Odwalla
marketing vice president Brian Lovejoy,  &LR; who designed such drinks
as C Monster, Mo' Beta and Super Food for the big natural juice
company
</P>
<P>
   But Lovejoy wanted to move from nutrition to herbal therapies.
He teamed with ethnobotanist Dennis McKenna, former Odwalla Chief
Operating Officer Michael Young and Joel McCleary, who has a kava
farm on Molokai in Hawaii. The company now &LR;   &LR; occupies Odwalla's old
headquarters in Davenport, north of Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   DrinksThatWork come in three seven-ounce formulations: Forza,
including Saint-John's-wort St. John's wort  &LR; and ginseng for
sustainable energy; Kava, with 500 milligrams of Polynesian kava,
to improve well-being; and Luna, a spicy soy milk blend that
includes valerian root, chamomile and griffonia seed, to help one
sleep better.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.69 suggested retail price is prices are  &LR; double what many
other beverages sell for, or a multiple of that considering their
small size. But like its name, DrinksThatWork promises more than
refreshment. ``We're not selling juice,'' said Lovejoy, 36. ``The
purpose is to provide a therapeutic dose of herbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The company says it packs 10 to 100 times as much botanical
punch in its elixirs as other herbal beverages. That extra punch
can get expensive. For example, West African griffonia seed extract
processed in India costs about $545 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   As for the taste, several shoppers, who got free samples at
Whole Foods in San Francisco last week, said it was ``pretty good
for an herbal drink'' but not exactly delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Lovejoy notes that most people do not love the taste of beer or
coffee the first time they try them, either. Just as people move
from soda pop to more-adult beverages, he hopes they will migrate
to herbal therapy in a bottle. Since March, the company has won
shelf space in more than 120 retail stores, including Wild Oats,
and  &LR; Rainbow Foods and some fancy hotels.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other New Age beverage-makers who are adding
botanicals to their blends. But sometimes these are little more
than cleverly packaged sugar water and fruit juice concoctions
containing only traces of medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new vendors of these ``New Age'' herbal beverages are
AriZona and South Beach of Norwalk, Conn. SoBe, as it is called,
branched into herb-spiked drinks two years ago when its line of
conventional cold tea drinks fizzled. With the help of clever
marketing and a cute lizard logo, sales of SoBe's Lizard Blizzard,
Zen Blend and other colorful drinks are approaching $200 million,
and health-conscious Northern California is the biggest market.
</P>
<P>
   Odwalla has a successful line of ``nutra smoothies.'' Ice
cream-maker Ben &AMP; Jerry's launched a line of botanically bolstered
frozen smoothies last month, and Snapple also has a new line of
Elements drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes entrepreneurs catch the business bug almost by
accident. Teacher Knight-McDowell, 39, and her writer-husband,
Rider McDowell, 38, turned herbal entrepreneurs to help ward off
infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are rife with germs, and I was always getting a cold
from my second-grade kids at Spreckels Elementary School near
Salinas,'' said Knight-McDowell. ``And Rider was always getting
sick on airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   She tried various pills and potions to ward off germs and
viruses, but they didn't seem to work.
</P>
<P>
   So when Hallmark paid McDowell Rider  &LR; $150,000 to turn a script
into a TV movie, they invested the proceeds and then some to
develop their own cold-fighting formula. They set set up
Knight-McDowell Labs in Carmel and hired nutritionists and
herbalists to come up with the formula, which includes organic
herbal extracts of lonicera, forsythia and schizonepeta.
</P>
<P>
   To market their product on the cheap, they Knight-McDowell &LR; 
 &LR; initially handed out postcards with tablets attached in crowded
urban malls and put them on the windshields of cars in airport
parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   Until January, they relied on online and telephone sales. Then
they got placement in Trader Joe's stores where Airborne has been
selling briskly at $5.99 per 10-tablet tube. They also are selling
at several Long's Drug, independent travel and other stores.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Airborne include actor Kevin Costner and 49ers head
athletic trainer Lindsey McLean. With annual revenues approaching
$1 million, Knight-McDowell is selling a third of the company to
the head of a $100 million a year East Coast manufacturing company
who will run it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing a business so quickly is exhilarating but also a
little scary,'' said Rider. &LR; McDowell. ``Sometimes you don't realize
what you don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Knight-McDowell, who has not given up teaching, hopes to spend
less time running the new business. Still, she and her husband are
pursuing new products: Doc-Pops, out this fall, are freezer pops in
four fruit flavors fortified with menthol, echinacea, ginger and
other additives.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery MD is a new line of effervescent tablets with herbs and
enzymes designed to help heal athletic injuries and treat hospital
patients before and after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Importers of herbal ingredients also are doing well.
</P>
<P>
   At Starwest Botanicals in Rancho Cordova near Sacramento, sales
increased nearly close to  &LR; 30 percent to around $10 million last
year, according to salesman James Lynn. Prices vary widely
depending on the herb or root and the specific active ingredients.
Powder extract for Siberian ginseng (0.8 percent active ingredient)
sells for about $12 a pound, while kava extract powder (30 percent
active ingredient) goes for about $73 a pound.

 Herbal Remedies Can't Make Claims  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Five years after Congress simplified the rules for selling herbs,
minerals and nutritional supplements, Food and Drug Administration
regulators are still struggling with how to label these products.
<P>
   A lot is at stake. The herbal and nutritional supplement vendors
feel federal law inhibits what they can say about the health
benefits of their products. But some consumer groups want the
federal government to do more testing to ensure that these products
are safe. At the same time, large pharmaceutical companies are
entering this lucrative market with their own ax to grind on the
issue of labeling.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, the agency will hold a daylong public hearing on
these matters and other issues arising from the Dietary Supplement
Health and Education Act of 1994, the law that spurred the
so-called herbal renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Supplements have become a huge industry, with Americans spending
more than $12 billion annually on products ranging from herbs that
purportedly improve memory to proteins that supposedly help people
bulk up.
</P>
<P>
   With supplement sales beginning to rival the $17 billion that
Americans spend each year on over-the-counter drugs, some large
drug companies like Bayer, Warner-Lambert and American Home
Products have jumped into the growing market for herbs and
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   FDA regulators find themselves caught between those who want
them to hurry up and those who want them to slow down this new
market.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Representative Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the
House Government Reform Committee, held two hearings this spring in
which he accused the FDA of impeding the supplement industry out of
what he considers a misplaced concern for safety. He said only 16
people reportedly died last year from herb overdoses, compared to
106,000 deaths from prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more likely that you will be struck by lighting and die
in this country than it is that you will die from using a dietary
supplement,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   But some consumer groups, led by the Center for Science in the
Public Interest of Washington, D.C., think the potential health
risks of herbal remedies have been vastly understated, because the
FDA has not yet created a central system that requires
manufacturers to report adverse effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law went too far too fast in the direction of
deregulation,'' said center legal director Bruce Silverglade. Among
other reforms, the center thinks supplement-makers should be
required to pay for studies proving the safety of their products
before they go on sale, as do makers of drugs or medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   But any such move would drastically alter the law Congress wrote
in 1994, when it put herbs, vitamins, minerals and proteins in a
special regulatory category, said Annette Dickinson, director of
the herb industry trade group Council for Responsible Nutrition, of
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson said Congress decided in 1994 that supplements, most
of which had been sold as folk remedies or food additives before
the law took effect, had been proven safe by years of use.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are things that have been around for a long, long time,''
Dickinson said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Congress freed supplement-makers from the
requirements placed on drug manufacturers, such as performing
safety tests and winning FDA approval before they can market a new
remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Supplement-makers skip this approval step, Dickinson said. If
supplement-makers want to sell a well-known herb or protein
extract, they just do it, she said. Even companies that want to
sell entirely new herbal or protein concoctions follow a simple
process. They tell the FDA what they plan to sell. The agency has
75 days to object if it thinks the new product might not be safe.
This procedure contrasts with the drug preapproval process, which
can take up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch in the 1994 law. While it expedites the
process for delivering products to market, it limits what can be
said about them, according to Rob McCaleb with Colorado's Herb
Research Foundation. Herbal manufacturers cannot claim their
products treat, cure or mitigate disease.
</P>
<P>
   This might stun consumers who have heard about the supposed
beneficial effects many herbs have on a variety of diseases. But
that consumer information must come from health newsletters or
other media, because the law restricts what herb vendors can say on
product labels or in ads.
</P>
<P>
   McCaleb used the example of garlic, which many people buy for
its supposed cholesterol-lowering properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company says, `Garlic helps prevent health disease,' that
would be a drug claim'' and a no-no under the 1994 law, McCaleb
said. Instead, supplement-makers would have to say something like,
``garlic helps maintain cardiovascular health,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between mentioning a specific disease and talking
about general health effects may seem like semantics, but that is
the nature of rule making. And so far, the FDA has been unable to
find the words to please all the groups interested in the labeling
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, echoing complaints from supplement-makers, has berated
the FDA for proposing to define menopause, pregnancy and aging as
diseases _ thus preventing herbmakers from using these words in
labels or ads.
</P>
<P>
   The entry of drugmakers into the nutritional supplement market
has complicated the regulatory situation. Over-the-counter drugs
are generally former prescription drugs that have gone off patent.
Before a drug becomes generic, the patent holder seeks FDA approval
to sell a version of the drug directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Once that approval is secured, the OTC vendor can say the drug
treats a specific disease, according to Joe Doss of the Consumer
Healthcare Products Association of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The association _ which was until recently called the
Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association _ wants to make sure
the new FDA labeling rules for supplements do not give the herbal
manufacturers the ability to make disease-fighting claims that OTC
manufacturers enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, McCaleb of the Herb Research Foundation thinks the
entry of the OTC drugmakers into the herb patch will prove a
blessing to the whole industry, as well as consumers.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, McCaleb thinks drug vendors will demand clear
rules from the FDA governing the manufacturing of herbal
supplements. One consistent consumer complaint is that herbs and
supplements vary greatly in quality or concentration even between
batches from the same manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 law ordered the FDA to set up a manufacturing review
program, but that process has lagged. McCaleb thinks big drugmakers
like Bayer or AHP will light a fire under the FDA's inspection
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   FDA regulators will hear these and other critiques at their July
20 hearing in Oakland. In testimony before Burton's committee
earlier this year, new FDA Commissioner Jane Henney acknowledged
the ``great faith'' many Americans place in supplements and the
frustration some feel with the agency's implementation of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge to FDA is to strike the right balance'' between
safety concerns and the expansion of the herbal marketplace, Henney
said.

 _ SF CHRON   Gates Wows 'Em at Summit On High Tech 
 &HT;     By Carolyn Lochhead 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates swept into a Capitol Hill hearing
room yesterday like an international celebrity, cameras flashing
and senators genuflecting before the undisputed uber-mogul of
American business.
<P>
   Despite his nondescript testimony, Gates drew a
standing-room-only crowd to the cavernous Hart Building on day two
of the Joint Economic Committee's three-day ``National Summit on
High Technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, whose utterances
are as closely dissected as the pope's, couldn't draw half the
crowd for his testimony the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians often don't show up for hearings, especially those
held by powerless panels like the Joint Committee, but Gates filled
the raised dais with everyone from Silicon Valley representatives
Tom Campbell, a South Bay Republican, and Anna Eshoo, D-Atherton,
to Washington state  &LR; Senators Slade Gorton and Patty Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, a Republican, and Murray, a Democrat, share a loyalty to
the Redmond, Wash., software giant that trumps their usual partisan
differences. Gorton called Gates ``a constituent and a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians flashed their own high-tech credentials, with
Representative Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., boasting of Manhattan's
``Silicon Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   A self-described computer geek and the world's richest man,
Gates hunched over the witness table and spoke in his
characteristic high-pitched voice punctuated by the occasional
squeak. Outlining his vision of a technological transformation of
the world, he urged the government to tread lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incredible success of this industry in the United States
owes a lot to the light hand of government in the technology area,
the fact that people can take incredible risks and, if they're
successful, they can have incredible rewards,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk-taking attitude is unique to the United States ...
and is the envy of the world,'' he said. ``The basic philosophy of
letting the marketplace work has been vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside a federal courthouse just a few blocks away, Microsoft is
fighting for its life in an epic antitrust battle. The Justice
Department accuses Microsoft of monopolizing personal computer
software and illegally taking over the Internet browser market.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Charles Robb, a Virginia Democrat, tentatively asked
Gates, ``without regard to the specifics of pending litigation,''
whether he would alter the nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people who dive into that, but I think the laws
as they are currently written are fine,'' Gates said. But he
touched on the heart of the trial, obliquely defending Microsoft's
right to incorporate Internet browsers into its Windows platform.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Certainly everything that's gone on in the technology
industry has come about because of  &LR; things like integrating new
features in  &LR; is one of the freedoms that all companies have,''
Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight young protesters glared silently from against one wall,
their T-shirts declaring, ``Limit Wealth'' and ``Bust the Trust.''
They said they were from the Ralph Nader-backed groups Public
Citizen and the Congressional Accountability Project.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of twentysomething lobbyists seated in the front rows
behind the witness table glanced back scornfully, shaking their
heads in bemused disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   They then turned back to listen to Gates talk about the
high-tech industry creating ``the greatest time of innovation and
change in history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet and the convergence of telecommunications,
computers and consumer electronics, Gates said, will create ``a
proliferation of smart, connected devices, from palm-size digital
assistants and `tablet' personal computers to smart TVs and
Web-enabled cell phones.''
</P>
<P>
   He envisioned a world where consumers manage their work and
their lives from a personal ``digital dashboard'' and a time ``in
the not too distant future (when) computers will be able to see,
listen and speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates then took a few more friendly questions from students
hooked up via satellite video conferencing from several high
schools and a college.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing his appearance, he left the room, and much of the
audience left with him.

THE VH1 OF SUPERSTARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Tim Duncan is thought to be drab and indifferent
by almost all of the basketball-consumed public. He is said to be
too boring to be the best player in the league, too passionless and
polite to be the leader of the Gen X stars. His own coach, Gregg
Popovich, has said that his extraordinary power forward has no
``MTV in him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is because Duncan doesn't hang on the rim, spread his legs,
growl and stare derisively at opponents after dunks. Or signal for
fans to raise the roof after San Antonio baskets. Or pound his fist
against his chest during momentum-building Spurs runs. Or gratify
the news media with controversial or humorous quotes. Duncan, 23,
simply plays basketball well. He scores and rebounds and blocks
shots better than any other player in the National Basketball
Association and does so with all the emotion of a grandmaster in a
chess match, leading onlookers to glorify his game but dread his
supposed lack of personality.
</P>
<P>
   But Duncan's teammates say that the dull and lifeless image is a
facade, that the player who will lead the Spurs against the Knicks
on Wednesday night in Game1 of the NBA finals pulls pranks like a
grade schooler and often has them in stitches in the locker room.
``Don't be fooled by all of that,'' Spurs guard Antonio Daniels
said, pointing to Duncan as the 7-footer soberly answered
reporters' questions. ``There's a lot of class clown in there
jumping around. With the media, he's kind of standoffish and
reserved. But we hang out all the time, so around me he feels like
he can afford to let himself go.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan denied none of this and when asked why he did not share
that side of himself with the public, he responded, ``Y'all don't
ask me funny questions.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing funny about the way Duncan has turned the NBA
into his own playground. Just two years removed from Wake Forest,
Duncan is already regarded as the league's most versatile and
dominant player. He was the only player to finish in the top 10 in
five of the league's nine statistical categories: points (21.7 a
game), rebounds (11.4), blocks (2.5), field goal percentage (.495)
and minutes (39.3). And if the Spurs defeat the Knicks, he will
become the first second-year player to lead his team to the title
since Boston's Larry Bird in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's Karl Malone won the most valuable player award, but if
the voting had been conducted within the past week, the honor
almost certainly would have gone to Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Ask anyone here _ Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy; the Knicks'
emerging star Marcus Camby; the former coach and longtime NBA
analyst Jack Ramsay, or Duncan's teammate and future Hall of Famer
David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best player in the league, and I thought he deserved
the MVP award,'' said Camby, who will be matched up against Duncan
at times in this series. ``Not only does he score but he rebounds
exceptionally well, he blocks shots and he plays aggressively on
defense. I'm just trying to get to where he's at right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay, who won 864 games in 21 seasons as an NBA coach, said,
``He may become the best of all time at the power forward
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan admits to being flattered by such compliments, but
refuses to let them go to his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awesome feeling, but I still have to go out there and
prove it every night,'' he said. ``All it means is that you've got
a higher bounty on your head.''
</P>
<P>
   That Camby, Kevin Garnett, Rasheed Wallace and the league's
other young frontcourt wonders are looking up to Duncan is somewhat
surprising. While they were playing basketball daily in the
schoolyards of America, Duncan was in his native St. Croix in the
Virgin Islands, striving to become a world-class swimmer. It was
not until Hurricane Hugo destroyed the local pool in 1989 that
Duncan, once a top U.S. competitor for his age group in the
400-meter freestyle, became even remotely interested in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   At 13 years old, he was starting late, and with shockingly poor
coordination he seemed to be nobody's great find. Duncan aspired to
be like his basketball hero, Magic Johnson, but he was so out of
touch with the game and its skills that competitors nicknamed him
Mr. Clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   But after some hard work and long hours, he improved enough to
earn a scholarship to Wake Forest, where he got off to a
not-so-blazing start: no points in his first game. By his junior
year, however, Duncan was a first-team all-American.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Camby, who was the nation's player of the year that
season (1996), Duncan chose to stay in school to complete his
degree in psychology and enjoy himself. He was the best player in
the land as a senior, and the Spurs, struggling because Robinson
missed almost the entire season with injuries, made him the first
selection in the 1997 draft. A few weeks later, during workouts
with Robinson in Aspen, Colo., Duncan established himself as the
Spurs' best player, astonishing Robinson and leading the onetime
league MVP to declare that Duncan was better than he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at his skills from the first time I saw him,''
Robinson said. ``Once I saw him doing some of the things that he
does, there was no question in my mind that he would become a
special player in this league. He's got great hands, great touch.
He's so smooth. ''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Popovich focused the Spurs' offense more on Duncan,
instead of Robinson. But Robinson, who advised Duncan during his
rookie season on how to guard various power forwards, remains
Duncan's mentor and considers that role as large a part of his job
as blocking shots and anchoring the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives me advice on the league, on situations, on everything
else,'' Duncan said of Robinson. ``He's just been a great person to
be there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan says he hopes to finish his career with the Spurs. But
because the team may leave the city if a vote to finance the
building of a new arena fails, Duncan said he would not sign a
contract extension with the Spurs when he becomes eligible this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this city,'' Duncan said. ``I hope the whole situation
works out, and I hope that as far as we've gotten now helps it out.
But I want to know where we are. I don't want to sign back with a
team and then end up wherever.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement ended yet another plain session with reporters
for Duncan, who then headed for Daniels, his best friend on the
team. Jokingly placing Daniels in a headlock, Duncan began smiling
and taunting his smaller teammate, showing more emotion and
personality than he ever has on the court.  &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ George W. Bush, the man in the monogrammed
cowboy boots, reconnected Tuesday night with the Yankee roots he so
often plays down, at the end of a day in which his rivals for the
Republican presidential nomination gave him his harshest taste yet
of the political perils that lie along the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   On the final stop of his first campaign swing, Bush was showered
with $1.3 million at a dinner crowning him the adopted favorite son
of Greenwich, which considers itself ground zero for Bushes
although the candidate himself has never lived here.
</P>
<P>
   The instant embrace by a crowd of more than 1,000, few of whom
had ever met the Texas governor but almost all of whom revere his
parents, seemed fitting for a campaign so mysteriously turbocharged
that even Bush himself claims not to understand the engine driving
it.
</P>
<P>
   But on Day 4 of his road show, conservative opponents rose up to
criticize him for a statement he made in New Hampshire on Monday
about prospective judicial appointees in a Bush administration.
Bush said then that he would nominate judicial conservatives to the
federal courts but would not require them to share his views on
specific issues, including abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no litmus test,'' he said, ``except for whether
or not the judges will strictly interpret the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Bush has voiced a general opposition to abortion
while acknowledging the constitutional right to it found by the
Supreme Court. He has also expressed a preference for changing
people's minds on the issue rather than changing the law.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction appears to be an important part of Bush's
strategy of projecting conservative values while trying not to
alienate his party's moderate wing, including voters who support
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, his latest remarks on the matter brought fire from
his closest challenger, Elizabeth Dole, who said through her
spokesman, Ari Fleischer, that any federal judge she appointed
would have to share her ``general philosophy'' of opposition to
abortion except in the cases of rape, incest or pregnancy that
endangered a woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   Two other rivals, Patrick Buchanan and Sen. Bob Smith of New
Hampshire, were much blunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's response is grossly inadequate,'' Buchanan
said from Manchester, N.H. ``After 40 years of liberal judicial
activism, we must have Supreme Court nominees dedicated to
overturning the abomination called Roe vs. Wade.''
</P>
<P>
   And Smith said Bush was trying to ``have it both ways,'' posing
as an opponent of abortion rights while allowing the possibility
that his judicial nominees would hold a different view.
</P>
<P>
   All this, along with similar criticism from other challengers,
was a preview of the whiplash Bush can expect in the days ahead as
he greets huge and largely unskeptical crowds at the same time that
his rivals are firing at the same target _ him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Here at the Hyatt Regency dinner Tuesday night, some eager but
tardy supporters turned blue bloods into scalpers, beseeching
dinner organizers for the right to pay for the seats of people who
had bought tickets but could not attend. ``People were desperate,''
said a longtime family friend, Betsy Heminway
</P>
<P>
   That may be the rarest of emotions for the fur and Ferrari set
in Greenwich, where the average price for a single-family home sold
last year was $1.3 million and where registered Republicans
outnumber Democrats by more than 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As much as Greenwich is money country, it is Bush country.
Bush's grandfather, the late Prescott S. Bush, was moderator of the
Greenwich Representative Town Meeting before becoming a U.S.
senator from Connecticut. The Greenwich establishment has also
fancied itself the ``favorite hometown'' of the governor's father,
former President George Bush, even though he was born in
Massachusetts, summered in Maine and kept his official address at a
hotel in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he campaigned for governor in 1994, one of Bush's
stock lines has been that the fundamental difference between the
two George Bushes is that his father went to Country Day School in
Greenwich, where people want to know who your parents are, and he
went to Sam Houston Elementary School in Midland, Texas, where the
kids wanted to know if he could hit a ball.
</P>
<P>
   In other tellings, he mentions San Jacinto Junior High in
Midland. Either way, the tale does not take into account his later
stops at Phillips Academy, Yale University and Harvard Business
School. Although his campaign Web site finds space for the names of
his dog and his three cats, it omits mention of his birthplace: New
Haven, where his father was studying economics at Yale.

   Tuesday night organizers acknowledged Bush's new life with a
``Star of Texas'' theme that added fruit salsa and lemon-sage sauce
to the roast breast of chicken, and pink grapefruit to the green
salad. Larger donors were listed on the program as ``Longhorns,''
while the next category down was ``Lonestars.''
</P>
<P>
   People here professed not to be worried about what they, and the
country, did not know about Bush and his positions on issues. Asked
about his expertise in foreign policy, Natalie T. Pray, a former
diplomatic officer who has known the family for 30 years, gave him
credit for ``living in an area bordering Mexico.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Pharmacia Will Buy Sugen for $680 Million  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Sugen Inc., a South San Francisco biotech firm, yesterday agreed to
be acquired by New Jersey's Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc. for $650
million in stock. The companies said the price represented a 38
percent premium on Sugen's closing price yesterday.
<P>
   Executives from both firms said Sugen will retain its name and
local offices, adding that no major layoffs are anticipated. Sugen
employs 210 people in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest in a string of deals in which huge
pharmaceutical companies have acquired biotech firms, which have
had trouble raising money on Wall Street to support their costly
drug trials.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing Sugen chief executive Stephen Evans-Freke alluded to
this yesterday, saying ``the hostile environment for financing''
made it difficult for his company independently.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn chief executive Fred Hassan said his company
is most interested in three Sugen anti-cancer products that are in
late-stage human trials in preparation for seeking Food &AMP; Drug
Administration approval. Sugen is a leader in the field of
anti-angiogenesis, the attempt to shrink tumors by crimping the
supply of blood that fuels their runaway growth.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McCamant with the Medical Technology Stock Letter in
Berkeley, said the current stock slump in biotech seems to have
finally started the sort of consolidation that has been predicted,
but not materialized, in years past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so tough to raise money, that shareholders are somewhat
impatient and CEOs are not as cocky as they once were to go it on
their own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was announced after the market closed. Sugen fell 50
cents to $22.50 yesterday, which was close to the stock's 52-week
high.
</P>
<P>
   But though the deal may look good in the short run, Mark
Lampert, a principal with the Biotechnology Value Fund in San
Francisco, said it should concern investors that biotech companies
with products in late-stage trials feel they can't market a hit
drug on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory
approval, is planned to close in about three months. Sugen is 20
percent owned by British drugmaker AstraZeneca Group Plc, which has
agreed to vote its shares in favor of the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's most aggressive move since
1995, when the company formed itself by merging Sweden's Pharmacia
with the U.S.  &LR; Upjohn of the United States. With roughly $7 billion
in sales growing at a 12 percent rate, Pharmacia ranks 10th in size
among U.S. drug companies.

 &HT;    New bats change college game
 &HT;    By Ron Jackson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Offensive production is down at the College World
Series and one of the reasons is the new restrictions placed on the
aluminum bats used by college baseball players.
</P>
<P>
   Gayston Corp. of Springboro, Ohio is a bat maker for Rawlings.
The company has complied with the new restrictions while others,
like Easton Sports of Van Nuys, Calif., the country's largest
aluminum bat manufacturer, sued the National Collegiate Athletic
Association for $267 million, charging illegal restraint of trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA wants a 'wood-like' performance and feel from the
bats,'' said Mark Stone, owner and president of Gayston. ``The
restraints put less bat speed through the zone. It's like a war
club and not as much a safety hazard. It protects pitchers and
infielders.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the bats are shorter and heavier, slowing the
college hitters down.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said changes may be on deck at the high school level.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a favorable response to the new bat
modifications,'' Stone said. ``I look for the high school
federation to follow the NCAA lead next year, adopting the same
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayston's main business is making metal parts for the military
and auto industry. But several years ago, ``it struck us that we
could use the same process to make a bat,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 15 percent of the company's total sales come from
bat sales. Stone declined to reveal sales figures, but said the
company makes ``hundreds of thousands'' each year and that ``it's a
growing part of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Aldridge, a catcher who played four years at Eastern
Michigan University and is now a pitcher for the New York Yankees'
rookie team in Tampa, recalled last year's College World Series
championship when Southern California defeated Arizona State,
21-14. The game lasted four hours as the teams combined for nine
home runs and 39 hits. He said the lean high-tech bats are still
mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year they called the College World Series 'Gorilla-ball',
because of all the home runs,'' Aldridge said. ``Now you're seeing
more bunting, running and hit-and-runs in this year's series. The
new bat is heavier coming through the strike zone, but it has still
has some pop.. . . Balls fly off those bats.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Dayton catcher Jason Siegfried, now playing for
the Oneonta (N.Y.) Tigers, a Detroit Tigers Class A team, said it
took him three weeks to adjust to the new bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't see as many cheap hits with the new bats,''
Siegfried said. The restricted bats have done their job. According
to NCAA records, the Division I batting average was .301, down from
the 1998 average of .306. Home runs per game were 0.93, down from
1.06 last year. A record 62 home runs were hit in the 1998 College
World Series, 14 more than the previous high.

 &HT;    George W. may forgo debate, convention
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Unlike his dad who competed in two
Republican presidential straw ballots in Florida, Texas Gov. George
W. Bush has forced the GOP to scuttle any idea for a ballot, and
his campaign is even balking at participating in a nationally
televised candidate forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush doesn't even want to show up at the state party
convention,'' said a frustrated organizer of the October event.
``His campaign is more than interested in coming here to raise
money, but they don't want to do anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Expecting a $1 million payday June 25, Bush is attending $1,000
per person events in four cities next week in Fort Myers, Tampa,
Fort Lauderdale and Miami. The events are being organized out of a
Miami office by Ann Herberger, who worked for Bush's younger
brother, Jeb, during the race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the Florida campaign team worked for Jeb Bush
last year. Al Hoffman, chief executive of Watermark Communities
Inc., is the campaign's state finance chairman. Mark Guzzetta, a
partner in Blue Lake development in Boca Raton, is the vice
chairman. Jillian Inmon, director of scheduling in both the
campaign and governor's office, will become the state campaign
manager in September. And unofficially, Bush's chief of staff,
Sally Bradshaw, and director of communications, Cory Tilley, have
assisted the Bush presidential effort.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Jeb Bush has on occasion gone to a private office
in Tallahassee to make phone calls in an effort to raise money for
his brother. While all that is going on, however, some Republicans
are complaining that the Texas governor's campaign is trying to
diminish the impact of the state's fourth presidential convention.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, former CIA director George Bush fought hard to win
votes in the first GOP presidential straw ballot. Up against Ronald
Reagan, former Texas Gov. John Connally, U.S. Sen. Bob Dole and a
handful of other hopefuls, Bush finished a surprising third behind
Reagan and Connally, who were favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, then-Vice President Bush won the GOP ballot
in a hotly contested race with television evangelist Pat Robertson.
Other contenders included former Secretary of State Alexander Haig,
New York Congressman Jack Kemp and Dole.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's Larry King was the featured attraction at Presidency III,
the 1995 convention. He moderated a debate among the nine
Republican candidates that was broadcast nationwide. The chairman
of the convention was Jeb Bush, who insisted on a high profile
straw ballot and the appearance of all the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Dole won the ballot, defeating Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and six other GOP candidates. Bush
hailed the convention as a huge success.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his big brother wants no part of a straw ballot or
televised debate, even one hosted by ABC's Cokie Roberts, an anchor
of the Sunday program This Week. ``Why would he want to do a
forum?'' asked an adviser to the Bush campaign. ``Why give credence
to his opponents in a state where he doesn't have to?''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a debate, the Bush camp is leaning toward allowing
each candidate to speak for a few minutes and have separate rooms
for hosting meet-the-candidate gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   GOP state chairman Al Cardenas insists that the convention will
be the best political event in the country this year. ``We are
going to have a lot of national and state press, and when the fever
pitch gets really high, I think you'll find all of the candidates
will participate,'' he said. ``We still absolutely plan on having
Cokie Roberts and some type of forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas flew to Texas recently to meet with Bush and his
campaign staff. They talked about many things, including the
convention. ``They are just not ready to make a commitment yet,''
he said. ``That's understandable; they have a lot to do right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those are next week's money raising events, which include
among their hosts businessman Wayne Huizenga and U.S. Reps. Mark
Foley of West Palm Beach and E. Clay Shaw of Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter being sent to potential Florida donors, the Bush
campaign is making it clear that money should be contributed soon.
``We must send a strong message of support by contributing now.
Early contributions to this exploratory committee will be the most
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Said one recipient of the letter, ``I think they hope they can
starve out the other candidates long before the state convention.''

POPE, ILL, CANCELS VISIT TO ARMENIA  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to expand, adds new 2nd graf on pope not visiting Armenia,
adds reaction)   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KRAKOW, Poland _ Stunning the million Poles who were waiting for
him in a rain-soaked meadow, Pope John Paul II canceled all his
planned appearances Tuesday, sick with what the Vatican said was a
temperature of 100.4.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has also set aside a plan for the pope to stop in
Armenia on Friday, a spokesman for the Armenian Orthodox Church in
America said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of the evening of June 14, 1999, the Holy Father has had a
slightly raised temperature, likely to be connected with a viral
infection,'' the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said in
a statement shortly after Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican
secretary of state, began saying the morning Mass in the pope's
place.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Mass ended, hundreds of people left and began
lining up behind police barricades surrounding the bishop's house,
where the pope was staying, praying silently and craning for signs
of activity inside the silent yellow building. When an ambulance
drove into the main entrance, many in the crowd gasped and
whispered ``Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, the pope made a brief appearance at the
window of the bishop's house to reassure the hundreds of young
people gathered there for a pop music festival in his honor.
Smiling, but speaking with difficulty in a hoarse voice, he said,
``I am so grateful to you for your presence and the concert. Let us
sing, `Mary, Queen of Poland.''' He led them in the hymn, waved and
then said, ``Good night.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier, Navarro-Valls appeared on a Polish news
program and said the pope was feeling ``well, taking into
consideration that he has a slight fever.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that it had not yet been decided whether the pope would
be able to visit his hometown, Wadowice, on Wednesday, but that the
planned canonization of a 13th-century Polish queen would take
place. The pope can confer sainthood from his residence, and does
not need to attend the ceremony in person.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Valls also said he could not confirm whether the pope
would go through with his freshly hatched plan to visit Armenia
after Poland. But a spokesman for the Armenian Orthodox Church in
America, which helped arrange the visit to the church's ailing
patriarch, Karekin I, said the Vatican had let their church know
that the pope would not be stopping in Armenia on Friday on his way
back to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old pope has canceled Vatican events for health
reasons before, and in 1994 was forced to postpone a trip to the
United States after falling and breaking his thigh bone. But in his
previous 87 foreign trips, he only canceled a public appearance
once, in Peru in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation Tuesday night was particularly crushing to
Krakow's residents. The ancient city, the spiritual capital of
Poland, is where the young Karol Wojtyla secretly studied for the
priesthood during the Nazi occupation and where he was the
archbishop from 1963 until his election to become pope in Rome in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   The pope would not easily give up celebrating Mass here. But as
Navarro-Valls explained it, ``Even the pope has to obey someone,
and in this case, it is his doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mass was covered live by Polish state television. When the
pope's absence was announced, an announcer told viewers ``to pray
for the health of the Holy Father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just waiting _ I cannot say for what,'' said Kazimiera
Witek, 48, a social worker in Krakow, who stood outside the
bishop's residence in the early afternoon. ``I don't expect him to
appear. It's better for him to rest.'' Then-Archbishop Wojtyla
officiated at her confirmation in 1965, and like so many other
Krakow natives, she feels like she knows him personally.
</P>
<P>
   She had first heard the news at the Mass, when it was announced
over a loudspeaker. ``It was raining so hard I couldn't hear the
announcement,'' she recalled. ``People whispered it to each other
from group to group. It was such a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, who replaced John Paul II as
archbishop of Krakow, delivered the pope's homily. ``Now our
thoughts are directed to the Holy Father,'' he said, ``who, as I
have said, will be saying Mass at this time in the chapel, in unity
with our prayers.'' The congregation listened silently under a sea
of umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   Since he arrived in Poland for a grueling 13-day visit, the
pope, who usually walks with a cane, has looked tired but has
spoken in a firm voice. He has often strayed from his prepared
remarks to make puns and homey jokes in his native language.
</P>
<P>
   He slipped last Saturday morning and cut his head, requiring
three stitches that were administered by his personal doctor,
Renato Buzzonetti. Asked if the fever is connected to the fall,
Navarro-Valls said, ``absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who never fully recovered from the 1981 assassination
attempt, was operated on in 1992 for a benign intestinal tumor, and
had an appendectomy in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He broke his shoulder in a fall in November 1993 and broke his
thigh bone after slipping in the bathroom in April 1994, postponing
a trip to the United States until October 1995. On Christmas Day
1995 he suddenly interrupted his traditional blessing, broadcast
live from Saint Peter's, when he was overcome by nausea. Last Feb.
3 he canceled a general audience in Rome; the Vatican said he had
the flu.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few years, the pope has shown increasing
difficulty walking, and other symptoms, most notably the trembling
of his left hand, have become obvious. Officials say privately that
he has Parkinson's disease, but the Vatican has never confirmed it.
The pope does not like to be coddled, and he frequently brushes off
aides who try to help him.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the pope braved gray skies and chill winds at a prayer
service in Sosnowiec, a mining town in northeast Poland. He spoke
in a firm voice but looked weary. As the Vatican disclosed Tuesday,
he was already running a fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed very, very tired,'' said Tomasz Budzyn, 19, who
worked as a volunteer security aide at the service. ``I noticed
that he seemed almost asleep in his Popemobile.''
</P>
<P>
   Others began worrying late Monday night, when the pope failed to
address waiting crowds at his window, as he has on all other trips.
A bishop said the Pope was ``too tired'' to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt something was wrong, because it is such a tradition
with us,'' said Jagna Sobala, 45, a shop owner. ``He always checks
in with us there.'' &QL;

OVER 2,500 RETURN TO KOSOVO; MINE KILLS A WOMAN ON TREK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ A woman was killed Tuesday morning by a land
mine as she tried to walk back into Kosovo over a hillside near
here, the first casualty of the journey home. As the number of
refugees joyously returning home from here swelled, the death
pointed up the validity of the warnings from the U.N. high
commissioner for refugees about the dangers the refugees face as
they return.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,500 refugees surged out of Macedonia back into
Kosovo Tuesday _ seven times the number of refugees who crossed the
border Monday _ traveling on foot, in cars and, in one case, by
chartering their own bus.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's death and the sharp rise in the number of refugees
crossing the border alarmed officials of the refugee agency, who
fear a chaotic rush back into Kosovo. If refugees return to Kosovo
before the one-month period NATO has said it needs to secure the
province, they not only face danger from the land mines, but also
may not be able to support themselves once they return home, the
agency's officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But refugees who gleefully crossed the border here Tuesday
discounted the dangers and said it was their right to return home
now. By midafternoon, a mile-long line of cars had formed at the
border as Macedonian guards slowly processed the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we're worried about it but there is nothing we can do for
now,'' said Makfride Krasniqi, who was waiting with her parents,
teen-age brother and three young children to return to the nearby
town of Kacanik. ``We just want to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   By dusk the flow had slowed, but Astrid van Genderen Stort, a
refugee agency spokeswoman, said she expected more refugees to make
the trip Wednesday. Her fear, she said, is that the charter bus
idea that was executed successfully Tuesday will spread. The bus
was chartered by a family of 36, who had been living in a refugee
camp, for about $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee killed by the land mine Tuesday morning was a woman
trekking back into Kosovo with her husband and two friends, the
refugee officials said. The explosion killed her instantly and
wounded her husband.
</P>
<P>
   He made his way to a U.S. Army checkpoint on the Kosovo side of
the border, where he was treated for minor wounds, the officials
said. The man then continued on his way, seemingly determined to
not let anything separate him from his home.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two days, dozens of men sent out by their families
as scouts to determine what living conditions are like inside
Kosovo have been making their way to the towns of Kacanik, Vitina
and Urosevac in southeastern Kosovo, five to 25 miles from the
Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   In Kacanik Monday and Tuesday, refugees and men in uniforms of
the insurgent Kosovo Liberation Army let out whoops and shrieks of
joy as they spied each other in the debris-littered streets of a
town where the Kosovars and Yugoslav soldiers had fought fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgent group has taken de facto control of the town,
setting up its own checkpoints. But nearly all of its troops here
are following orders from their superiors not to carry weapons and
American troops patrolling the town said they have been cooperative
and ``very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   At the border Tuesday, workers handed out pamphlets describing
the dangers of land mines. But one refugee, Jonos Emini, said,
``Why would I be scared if I am going to my home town? I was never
scared of the Serbs.''

KOSOVARS FOUND REFUGE IN SERBIAN MONASTERY, AFTER BURNING AND
LOOTING

   DECANI, Yugoslavia _ As Serb forces withdrew from western
Kosovo, some of them burning and looting as they retreated, Father
Iguman and Father Sava moved among them, asking them to spare the
houses of their neighbors and bringing terrified Albanians here, to
this revered Serbian Orthodox monastery near Pec.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the best people you can ever see,'' said Venera
Lokaj. ``They are people of God. They heard Decani was burning, and
they came to search for people. They found us there in the open,
with everything burning, and they told us, `We are blessed to see
you alive. Please be reasonable and come with us. Please come to
the monastery.'''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lokaj is an Albanian, one of the 200 or so who have taken
refuge in this monastery, under cooling trees, retrieved from
misery by the fathers here.
</P>
<P>
   She had lived in nearby Pec, which was destroyed by Serb forces
and paramilitaries in their rampage of revenge when NATO began
bombing Yugoslavia in March. She moved with her father, Nimon, to
Decani, because it had already been destroyed by Serbs the previous
summer. ``I thought it would be safer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They were ordered to remain inside by the Serbs, and had little
chance to buy food in the destroyed town. But they were otherwise
left alone. ``We stayed inside for two and a half months,'' she
said. ``Until two days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Belgrade capitulated and the Serb forces were given
six days to pull out of this region, ``they got mad at
everything,'' Miss Lokaj said, ``and they began to burn again.''
The Serbs ``took anything they wanted, and they started driving
people out of the center.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs arrived at their apartment building about 9 p.m. on
Saturday and set fire to the first floor, Miss Lokaj said. ``We
were terrified and screamed at them from the balcony, `We're here!'
They looked up, but didn't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   They ran downstairs, leaving the canvasses of her father, a
well-known painter, to the flames. One Serb neighbor became angry,
but was ordered to be quiet, she said. So the the Lokajs and two
other families hid outside in the dark, fearing the Serbs would be
back to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, Father Iguman and Father Sava, the two
ranking monks here, found them and brought them to Decani. Father
Sava, a tall, slightly plump man of 33 with a curly tan beard and
eyeglasses, said he had only done what anyone would do. ``We
offered them hospitality and I am very pleased they accepted,'' he
said in fluent English.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he said, the monastery was host to 50 Serb refugees
expelled from surrounding villages by the Kosovo Liberation Army,
and they remained here through the bombing by NATO, whose forces
here are known as KFOR. ``But now, all of them became afraid and
left,'' Father Sava said sadly. ``We begged them to stay and told
them that KFOR would protect them, but they said there was a vacuum
and they couldn't stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,000 Serbs of Decani, he said, only about 10 remain.
``This is a biblical catastrophe, with the flight first of the
Albanian population and then the Serb population,'' Father Sava
said as he offered the monastery's home-made brandy, thick bread
and pepper spread.
</P>
<P>
   Father Sava is not an overtly political person, but his views
are sharply expressed. ``National traditions were misused by
irreligious and immoral people who don't care about God or
tradition at all,'' he said. ``And people were pushed and forced to
believe in things that were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The church, he said, took a clear position against violence,
ethnic purging and for the democratization of both Serbia and
Albania, which was not the policy of the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, NATO's bombing campaign, which the church opposed,
set off the very humanitarian disaster it was intended to prevent.
Father Sava had himself warned Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright in Washington in February what would happen to the Kosovo
Albanians if NATO bombed, he said. ``I told her clearly what would
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Artemija of Rasca and Prizren, the head of the Serbian
Orthodox Church, published an open letter calling the bombing a
mistake. ``The bombs gave the pretext to the expulsion of a great
number of Albanians and gave the pretext to the exodus of the
Serbs,'' he said. ``And democratic forces in Serbia are now almost
nonexistent, and President Milosevic is triumphant in his phantom
victory, and there is a lot of anti-Western feeling among Serbs
that will stop democratic processes in this area for a long time to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Sincere diplomacy could have solved the problem without war,
Father Sava said, and if the unarmed monitors of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe had remained in Kosovo, but
in larger numbers, ``nothing like this would have happened.'' The
problems here ``would not have been easy to resolve,'' Father Sava
said. ``But it could have been done. And now we've ethnically
cleansed Kosovo and destroyed it and produced enormous suffering on
all sides.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Miss Lokaj had worked for the security organization in Pec. She,
too, speaks fluent English, and she, too, is very angry. ``When the
OSCE left, they told us they would be back in two weeks and
everything would be the way we wanted it,'' she said bitterly. ``We
hoped so, but after three days, everything changed. When NATO
started bombing, the police and the paramilitaries started
destroying everything that was Albanian.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs ``made a war against civilians, against people with
empty hands,'' she said. ``There was no KLA in Decani or in Pec,
and they had no right to do what they did. This is a catastrophe.
And the world saw this, it saw everything, and the world is too
late. I know the world felt it had the best intentions, but there
is a fatality about good intentions, and they always come too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   She turned away, brushing her brown hair from blazing eyes. ``I
hate the words, `I'm sorry,''' she said. ``The world always says,
`I'm sorry,' and it's always too late. The British said, `Be
patient. You have the sympathy of the world.' Well, the ground
burned under our feet, and the world says we have its sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lokaj stopped again, and then said, keeping her voice slow
and even: ``Don't ever be sorry about the people who are still
alive. Just be sorry for the dead.''

   Higher interest rates seen on horizon
</P>
<P>
   By David McNaughton
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Marvin Sherman doesn't need today's government report
on consumer prices to know the cost of living is increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My haircut just went up,'' he said Tuesday outside a
supermarket. ``You know why? Because the rent went up.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing. Insurance. Gasoline. Autos. College tuition. They've
all gone up in price, too, Sherman says, but not so fast as to jump
out at you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has increased, very gradually,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the haircut. Until last month.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-May, the government reported the Consumer Price Index
jumped 0.7 percent in April. That surprise knocked the Dow Jones
industrial average back almost 194 points on the day of the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The change from what had been a long pattern of small increases
in inflation heightened Wall Street's interest in today's
announcement of the May CPI numbers.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the numbers will help determine whether the
Federal Reserve pushes interest rates higher when its policy-makers
meet June 29 and 30. Or whether there will be more than one
increase aimed at slowing the economy and limiting inflation.
</P>
<P>
   A rate boost at the end of June is pretty much a foregone
conclusion, according to Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic
Forecasting Center at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Fed has already made up its mind to go (up) a
quarter'' percentage point, Ratajczak said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He expected an increase of 0.3 percent in May's overall CPI, and
0.2 percent for the core rate, which excludes food and energy
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Those are better than the April figures but would signal
``gradually accelerating'' inflation, Ratajczak said.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks recorded modest gains Tuesday ahead of the CPI numbers _
as well as today's news on housing starts, industrial production
and capacity utilization, and the Fed's Beige Book report on
regional economies.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 0.3 percent, and
the Nasdaq composite added 0.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While he thinks inflation will continue to accelerate for
several months, Ratajczak said the consumer price numbers he
forecast for May should not be high enough to trigger more than one
interest rate boost.
</P>
<P>
   Still, inflation, even without leading to an interest rate
boost, affects everyone, he noted, from Social Security recipients
to consumers with variable-rate loans. It can also affect their
expectations, Ratajczak noted:
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hear the CPI is accelerating, they may wonder why
their wages aren't accelerating.''

 &HT;    OHIO COUNTIES DESIGNATED DRUG-TRAFFICKING AREA
 &HT;    Attn: Cox Ohio papers.
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several northern Ohio counties have been designated
a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, the White House Office of
National Drug Control Policy announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuyahoga, Lucas, Summit, Stark and Mahoning counties are
affected by the designation, which allows federal officials to work
more closely with state and local efforts to reduce drug
trafficking and related violence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the drug policy office has allocated $700,000 to be
spent this fiscal year for law enforcement initiatives in the area,
and about $2 million in subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the office, areas around Cleveland, Toledo, Akron,
Canton and Youngstown are plagued by crack cocaine and heroin
trafficking. Law enforcement investigations have found that most
drugs arrive in Cleveland from multiple sources, which ``ensures
the constant flow of drugs into the 'consumer' area of northern
Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted with the designation,'' said Sen. Mike
DeWine, R-Ohio, who has long requested the federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine said that state and local authorities have become
overwhelmed by the volume of drug trafficking in the area, located
at the intersection of major north-south and east-west
transportation routes.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in his early years working as an assistant county
prosecutor, he saw the importance of sharing information among
various law enforcement agencies, and the new partnership ``brings
to critical mass the different law enforcement agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, director of the drug policy office, said the
new funds will be used for ``intelligence, training, coordination
and automation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug challenge is clearly more than destroying criminal
organizations. It is prevention treatment that won't work unless
law enforcement agencies are doing their jobs,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to northern Ohio, McCaffrey announced similar drug
trafficking areas in central California, Oregon, New England and
Hawaii. They join 21 other areas previously designated across the
United States. The program started with five in 1990.

   Corporate executives live in fear of what happened to Coca-Cola
Co. Following reports that scores of Belgian children fell ill
after drinking the company's trademark beverage, the governments of
France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands ordered bans on
Coke products.
</P>
<P>
   The government decisions _ and the resulting concern by
consumers over the safety of the company's soft drinks _ creates a
significant public relations challenge for the company, according
to management professors and consultants. Coca-Cola has issued a
statement assuring consumers that there are ``no health or safety
issues'' concerning its products, but the outside experts say the
company's reputation remains at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time the government bans your product, it sends a very,
very strong signal to the public,'' said Steven Fink, president of
Lexicon Communications Corp., a crisis-management firm based in Los
Angeles. Unlike a voluntary recall, in which a company is seen as
acting on its own, a ban may suggest that regulators believe a
company is not taking sufficient steps to protect the public.
</P>
<P>
   The question now facing Coca-Cola is whether it is moving
aggressively enough to reassure the public by explaining clearly
what caused the events in Belgium and by making its top executives
available. While the current crisis is not as serious as the one
faced in 1982 by Johnson &AMP; Johnson when some packages of Tylenol
had been tampered with or by Source Perrier SA over contamination
of its bottled water in 1990, how Coca-Cola handles this is
critical to its reputation, say the experts. Any doubt about the
safety or quality of its beverages needs to be erased as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will find it very easy not to consume this brand,
for days or weeks,'' said Stephen Greyser, a marketing professor at
Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Some management professors and consultants say that Coca-Cola
needs to do more.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman declined to comment on Coca-Cola's handling
of the recall, arguing that ``it is premature to do the Monday
morning quarterbacking.'' The company issued a statement saying
that defective carbon dioxide and an external odor on some of its
cans had caused the consumers in Belgium to feel ill. Coke also
emphasized it was taking the complaints seriously and was working
with the Belgian officials to make sure its products are safe.
</P>
<P>
   But crisis-management experts say that any company faced with a
safety concern over its products must do everything in its power to
persuade the public that it is addressing that concern. The company
needs both to explain why some children became ill and to make
clear how it plans to make sure there are no future problems, they
say. If it is successful, even as tragic an event as the tampering
with Tylenol will raise its credibility, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The company needs to ``overreact,'' said Gerald C. Meyers, a
business professor at the University of Michigan. He maintains that
Coca-Cola chairman and chief executive M. Douglas Ivester should
speak out, assuring the public that the company is doing all it
can. ``Nobody less than Ivester should come forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives in Belgium have commented on the situation,
according to the Coca-Cola spokesman. While he confirmed that
Ivester had not been quoted about the events, he said that
Coca-Cola ``is a local business in 200 countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Coca-Cola apparently hopes to limit any concerns to a
handful of European countries, the danger is that the anxiety over
its products could spread. ``I would expect that this would be
contagious,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are dealing with is their credibility,'' he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A self-styled whistle-blower whose dealings with
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. put them both under criminal
investigation has had a previous tussle with Corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Joseph Luethke, the whistle-blower, conducted an
extended letter-writing campaign three years ago to put pressure on
Seagram Co. chief executive Edgar Bronfman Jr. and other sponsors
of the Bronx Gauchos amateur basketball club. He called on the
corporate backers to exclude Lou D'Almeida, the club's founder,
from an active role in managing the Gauchos, a well-known training
club that has produced several National Basketball Association
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a swirl of charges that never led to any indictments,
D'Almeida stepped down from his executive role in the Bronx-based
basketball club two years ago. Friends cited Luethke's allegations
and the dispute that ensued as a big reason for D'Almeida's
decision to relinquish his day-to-day duties.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict about the Gauchos has some parallels to Luethke's
dealings with Morgan Stanley, lawyers involved in both cases said.
In both, Luethke parlayed initial presentations as a do-gooder
exposing wrongdoing into what the corporations would later view as
exortion. Luethke denies trying to extort money. He calls himself a
``whistle-blower extraordinaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous brush with a top corporation adds to the mystery
surrounding Luethke, whose jousting with Morgan Stanley over a
$10,000 payment embarrassed that top Wall Street firm. It has led
to the resignations of two top lawyers there and invited an
investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office in which
Morgan Stanley and Luethke are still subjects.
</P>
<P>
   While corporate officers and white-shoe lawyers who have tangled
with Luethke say they suspect that his goal is to extort money,
Luethke seems as eager to humiliate his antagonists publicly as he
is to extract money from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reading about the Morgan Stanley case and I could not
believe my eyes,'' said a member of the nonprofit board of the
Teamwork Foundation, which sponsors the Gauchos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The details were very familiar,'' said this person, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``Then I realized we were talking about
the same guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Luethke, a 29-year-old who has no full-time employment, first
approached Morgan Stanley last year with a tip that Christian
Curry, a former analyst at the firm, was conspiring to plant fake
e-mails on Morgan Stanley's computers to bolster a discrimination
lawsuit he wanted to file. Luethke took part in a police undercover
operation that resulted in Curry's arrest. Morgan Stanley quietly
paid Luethke $10,000 shortly after the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Morgan Stanley officials may wish they had done a
little more checking up before accepting Luethke's offer of help.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley lawyers said in court documents that when they
first met Luethke last summer, they thought of him as a good
Samaritan, adding that the firm paid him $10,000 as a ``reward''
for thwarting a crime. After that, the lawyers said, Luethke used
the payment as a hook to demand much more money, arguing that
without a formal business relationship, the payment could get
Morgan Stanley into trouble. ``The informant made vigorous and
extensive efforts to extort large sums from Morgan Stanley,'' the
documents state.
</P>
<P>
   But just a year before he called on Morgan Stanley, and just
several blocks away from the securities firm's corporate
headquarters in midtown Manhattan, Luethke had engaged in another
prolonged cat-and-mouse game with Lankler, Siffert &AMP; Wohl, a law
firm representing the Teamwork Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Luethke, a native of Haworth, N.J., said he played for the
Gauchos and later worked as a tutor for children enrolled in the
program. The Gauchos serve inner-city youths ages 5 to 19, helping
them realize their potential in basketball while keeping up on
academic studies.
</P>
<P>
   D'Almeida started the Gauchos 30 years ago. A child of a
well-connected Argentine family who attended Yale University,
D'Almeida attracted support for his program from prominent people
in business, sports and entertainment. Bronfman, Jonathan Tisch of
Loews Hotels, actress Lauren Bacall and former basketball star
Willis Reed have been among the Gauchos' prime backers and board
members.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Luethke wrote letters and sent repeated faxes to
Bronfman and other members of Teamwork Foundation, alleging
improprieties in the way the Gauchos were run. He also claimed to
have evidence of a sex scandal involving D'Almeida. The board hired
Lankler, Siffert &AMP; Wohl to investigate the charges, said a
foundation board member. Luethke also told law enforcement
authorities about his claims.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed to provide evidence, Luethke asked lawyers
representing the foundation to pay him money, said two people who
later investigated the events. They said that letters from Luethke
support the contention that he asked for money, but added that he
did not couple his requests with specific threats _ a combination
that would qualify his actions as extortion in a legal sense.
</P>
<P>
   Luethke refers to the suspicions about his motives in a letter
he wrote to top executives of Seagram in October 1996. In the
letter, Luethke says, ``The claim made by Teamwork Foundation's
lawyers and employees that I intend to extort the Foundation is
shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Tuesday that he never asked for and nor received any
money in connection with the Gauchos matter and that his only goal
was to make sure that D'Almeida was removed from his post.
</P>
<P>
   If he had evidence about wrongdoing by D'Almeida, Luethke never
produced it, several people involved in the matter said. The Bronx
district attorney's office said it conducted an investigation based
largely on Luethke's allegations. But a spokesman said Tuesday that
the office found no evidence of wrongdoing and closed the case
without bringing any charges.
</P>
<P>
   D'Almeida, who pleaded guilty to a charge of criminally
negligent homicide in 1971, also had problems at the Gauchos. The
National Collegiate Athletic Association investigated charges that
he paid team members in violation of NCAA rules, jeopardizing their
amateur status. There is no evidence that the NCAA took any steps
to sanction D'Almeida, though the pay-for-play charges received
wide publicity.
</P>
<P>
   D'Almeida stepped down from an active role in the club after
several New York newspapers and the sports industry press reported
on concerns about D'Almeida's past and the way the Gauchos were
run. Luethke's role in D'Almeida's departure was never publicly
revealed. But people close to D'Almeida and Bronfman say they still
smart when Luethke's name is mentioned.
</P>

   ``There were allegations several years ago that were thoroughly
investigated,'' said Austin Campriello, D'Almeida's lawyer, when
asked about Luethke's charges. ``Nothing came of them and I hate to
see this matter dredged up again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Teamwork Foundation board member who recalls Luethke's role
also said it had no positive effect. ``Lou stepped down because of
all the bad publicity,'' said the board member. ``It wasn't a great
outcome for anybody, but we wanted to protect the program.''

END OF WAR LEAVES RUSSIANS FED UP WITH OVERBEARING WEST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By   MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As a military operation, it was insignificant. But as a
symbol, there is no more potent metaphor for Russia's regard of the
West than the image last weekend of 200 Russian soldiers seizing a
Kosovo airfield, and then lining up armored personnel carriers to
keep NATO troops out.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin officials offered a strategic explanation for the move,
involving the need to acquire bargaining chips in talks on Kosovo's
future and to establish Moscow once and for all as a player in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   But most Russians were uninterested in the diplomacy. For them,
it was a moment to savor, a rare act of one-upmanship by a faded
power against a military that once viewed them with fear and awe.
But it was a chance to say vicariously what they increasingly feel:
that they are fed up with the overbearing West in general, and the
United States in particular.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy for most Westerners to understand. But 78 days of
war in Yugoslavia, a country a thousand miles removed from Moscow
and no special soul mate of Russia in any case, seems to have
convinced many Russians that the West is their enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the anti-Western attitudes that were accumulating in the
society resulted in this explosion when the war began,'' Igor
Bunin, a historian and director of Moscow's Center for Political
Technology, said in an interview. In focus groups involving scores
of Moscow residents, he said, ``many respondents said at the time
that the bombs were not falling on Yugoslavia, but on their own
heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is not universal. Some polls show Russian opinion of
the Unite States and the West has softened somewhat since the
war's peak. But even Russian newspapers, which viewed last
weekend's operation in Kosovo as a diplomatic and public-relations
debacle, called it ``dashing'' and lightning-fast.
</P>
<P>
   One noted with satisfaction that Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott's airplane had been forced to perform a mid-air
U-turn and return to Moscow when news of the troop movement
surfaced _ just desserts, because former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov had been forced to abandon a Washington trip in mid-air
when the bombing began in March.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia's pleasure at such slight victories seems out of
place, one need only listen to politicians and military leaders to
realize the depths of their anger at the West's supposed efforts to
feed on Russian weakness.
</P>
<P>
   In anonymous remarks this weekend, Russian military officials
repeatedly talked of ending their humiliation by American and NATO
forces, which bombed Yugoslavia with impunity. Ordinary Muscovites
frequently express the conviction that NATO and the West have
Russia in their sights, and that the Yugoslavia war was merely a
test run for a larger conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Much of their reasoning is no secret. In the former Soviet
Union, average people suffered, but could still take pride in
military and scientific achievements. Democratic Russia promised
affluence, peace and full membership in the club of Western nations
that many Russians had admired for decades.
</P>
<P>
   But none of it has come about. Russia's foundering transition to
capitalism was plotted largely by American academics and business
leaders and carried out by pro-Western politicians; some now see it
as a Western plot to impoverish the nation. Except for honorary
memberships in organizations like the G-8 group of industrial
nations and NATO's Partnership for Peace, Moscow has largely been
shut out of Western decision making.
</P>
<P>
   NATO itself has proven far more of a sticking point than many
Westerners realized. The West rebuffed Russia's early proposals to
move toward full membership in the alliance. When the United States
and Europe first announced plans to admit new members to NATO from
Central Europe, Russian leaders immediately complained that they
were being encircled by a potentially hostile military force _
fears that NATO tried to allay by giving Russia an advisory seat in
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to enlarge NATO could not be understood by
anybody in Russia because Russians know very well how weak Russia
is today,'' said Sergei Rogov, who heads the government's Institute
of the U.S.A. and Canada. ``On the other hand, Russians felt that
we ended the Cold War and started to behave nicely by dissolving
the Warsaw Pact, withdrawing troops, cutting arms. And thus the
very maintenance of NATO was seen as strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogov argued that the West consistently underestimated the
Russian public's suspicion of NATO's expansion. That raised the
prospect of an anti-Western explosion should NATO became involved
in a European crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Bunin, of the Moscow center, said Yugoslavia provided the
spark. The problem, he said, was not that Russians saw Yugoslavia
or its president, Slobodan Milosevic, as allies or martyrs; rather
the problem was the Russians had no opinions about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no anti-Milosevic propaganda in Russia,'' he said.
``Nobody looked at Milosevic as a new Hitler or as the person who
is seen in the West. And so the NATO and U.S. attack looked to us
as completely unprovoked, as the step toward world hegemony.''

MEXICAN PRESIDENT TRIES TO ENSURE A NIGHTMARE WON'T RECUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The former Mexican president, Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, was a political hero when he ended his term in 1994. But
just a few weeks later, the peso dived, jobs and savings were
annihilated, and Salinas was soon forced into disgrace and exile.
</P>
<P>
   Now his successor, President Ernesto Zedillo, is trying to
insure that an end-of-term economic nightmare does not recur when
he leaves office next year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Mexico announced that it has pulled together financing
and credits worth $23.7 billion to ``armor'' the economy, as
President Zedillo put it, through December 2000. That is when he
will turn over his office after six years to a new president chosen
in the most democratic _ and therefore the most unpredictable _
elections in Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the reassurance that top finance officials are
offering ahead of time to international markets, they also pledged
to maintain the disciplined economic policies that have allowed
Mexico to ride relatively smoothly while other Latin American
countries, especially Brazil, were buffeted by global turbulence
during the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria said Mexico would stick to a
modest government deficit of 1.25 percent of the nation's gross
domestic product this year, and to plans to lower it further, to 1
percent, next year. Guillermo Ortiz, the head of Banco de Mexico,
the central bank, said the battle against inflation would remain a
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Gurria said the finance package, including a $4.2 billion credit
from the International Monetary Fund, would ``allow us all to sleep
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF is providing the funds under a 17-month Standby
Arrangement, one of the agency's regular, non-emergency programs.
Mexican officials said the monetary fund is showing confidence in
Mexico, which is continuing to pay down $5.9 billion it owes from a
1995 bailout.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes $5.2 billion from the World Bank, mainly
for investments in social programs and government reforms, and $4
billion from the Export-Import Bank of the United States to help
underwrite some of the $200 billion in trade each year between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Inter-American Development Bank announced that
it would provide $3.5 billion in loans through the year 2001 for
big construction projects and reforms to strengthen local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Iglesias, the president of the bank, joined the chorus
of praise for Mexico on Tuesday, saying that by negotiating the IMF
loan Mexico ``provides additional comfort'' to international
markets about the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
   Like a patient struggling with mood swings, Mexico went far
toward controlling its habitual end-of-term depressions by just
acknowledging that they existed. Throughout his presidency, Zedillo
has built up foreign reserves so that the country would not be
caught short in case political events during the next year make
investors want to pull back. Now reserves stand at $30 billion, a
record high.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the imbalances that existed in 1994, and that led to
the crisis of 1995, are present today,'' Ortiz, the central banker,
announced triumphantly Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is expecting at least $9 billion in long-term foreign
investment this year, Gurria said. Overall foreign debt, by one
measure, is about half what it was in 1994, the finance minister
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost overkill,'' said Walter Molano, the head of
research at BCP Securities in Greenwich, Conn. ``They are so
heavily armored, they seem to be expecting something much worse
than even what the markets expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Steep downturns also came in 1982, when President Jose Lopez
Portillo nationalized the banks just before leaving office, and to
a milder degree in 1988 when Salinas took over.
</P>
<P>
   Economic collapse did not come until weeks after the end of
Salinas' term in 1994, but a series of unsettling events during his
final year in office undermined confidence in the economy. The
Zapatista Indian uprising in the southern state of Chiapas and the
assassination of the governing party's first presidential
candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, made investors nervous. They
bolted en masse when Mexico disclosed that its debts were far
outrunning its foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo spent his first years in office picking up the pieces of
the economy and started it growing again. He also promoted reforms
that made it much more difficult for him to control the outcome of
the presidential elections in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He has said he is anxious to spare Mexicans the losses they have
routinely suffered at the end of presidential terms. He is also
anxious to be spared the ostracism that fell to Salinas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House prepared for a high-stakes, heavily
lobbied debate on youth violence and guns, President Clinton and
pro-gun forces vied fiercely Tuesday for the votes of a critical
group of lawmakers from swing districts who could decide the
outcome of gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   With the contentious debate fracturing both parties in the
House, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., was working closely with Rep.
Tom DeLay, the majority whip from Texas, on an amendment that would
water down a provision passed by the Senate requiring background
checks on all buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   A confidant Dingell, whose victory would be a blow to the
president and the Democratic House leadership, predicted that he
had enough votes to prevail when the final gun control votes come
on Thursday. ``We will win,'' Dingell said.
</P>
<P>
   But the gun control issue has proven remarkably fluid and
unpredictable this spring, and gun control advocates were not
conceding the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, DeLay warned that the measure Dingell was
sponsoring might run into trouble. Republicans allied with DeLay
said they were concerned that conservatives might not rally around
him to vote for Dingell's amendment because they oppose any
restrictions at all on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Speaker Dennis Hastert has said Republican leaders
will allow gun control to be a vote of conscience for members,
DeLay has been instrumental in fashioning the structure of the
upcoming debate and the various gun control measures coming to the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   He met last week with Dingell and on Monday with aides to some
Republican moderates. His allies say DeLay is trying to pass some
modest gun control measure to keep Hastert, who virtually promised
some gun control, from another embarrassing defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Republicans said party leaders implored them Tuesday
night to hold together across the next few days and pass some kind
of a consensus bill rather than risk looking like a do-nothing
Congress. Democrats, however, charge DeLay is really trying to doom
any serious restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering was part of an intensifying fight for votes, as
well as a public relations drive by both parties seeking to appeal
to suburban parents stricken by a horrific series of school
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day both Clinton and a series of Republicans held
competing news conferences on gun control and Republican efforts to
regulate violence in entertainment. Both portray them as issues of
protecting children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared in the White House Rose Garden surrounded by
female members of Congress from both parties to rally support for
an amendment by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., that would counter
Dingell's measure and is modeled after the Senate legislation on
gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed appeal to suburban women, Clinton cast gun control
as a women's issue, saying, ``Women who belong to both parties in
America, all over this country, have been in the forefront of this
fight. They care about it as mothers, as sisters, as daughters, as
citizens of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   He also implored lawmakers not to heed the National Rifle
Association. ``Once again the gun lobby is resisting with all its
might,'' Clinton said. ``Once again, we're battling not just for
the safety of our families but the soundness of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans were trying to shift the focus from
gun control to cultural issues that they said were more responsible
for youth violence. Late Monday, in a surprise maneuver, they
decided to bring two separate bills to the floor _ one on social
and entertainment issues and the other simply on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, they highlighted measures ranging from federal
permission to post the Ten Commandments in schools to criminal
penalties for adults who allow children access to entertainment
that Republicans described as ``obscenely violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., cast youth violence as an issue of
culture, and said violent material makes it no surprise that
teen-agers ``plan mass murders instead of graduation parties.''
</P>
<P>
   But even some Republicans were opposed to some of the directions
their party was taking. ``This is a big government solution to a
problem that government can actually do little to solve,'' said
Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   On the table in front of him were videos that he said minors
would be prohibited from watching under a key Republican proposal,
including ``Schindler's List,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' ``Mission
Impossible'' and ``Home Alone.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, after a closed-door party caucus, Republicans
were still trying to decide which of nearly 200 measures relating
to gun control and youth violence to allow to the floor for a
debate expected to last 15 hours over two days.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were leaning toward allowing about 40
amendments on entertainment, culture and law enforcement _
including one on school prayer and the one allowing the Ten
Commandments to be posted in schools.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the gun control measures that were the focus of the
heaviest pressure.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri accused the
Republicans of seeking to rig House procedures in their favor.
``This is not a legislative process,'' he said in a letter to
Hastert, ``it is a deliberate effort to give gun control opponents
every advantage while depriving gun control advocates of vital
information.''
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to take up several competing versions of
the measure on background checks at gun shows. It is also to
consider requirements for child safety devices on new handguns, a
raise in the minimum age for all purchases of handguns to 21 from
18, a ban on the import of high capacity ammunition clips and new
restrictions on the possession of semiautomatic rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Several versions of each of these provisions have been proposed
by an array of lawmakers, some stronger than others. As of Tuesday
night, Republicans appeared likely to let to the floor a Republican
version of the child safety device measure that is less stringent
than the Democrats were proposing. But they were looking to allow
the Democratic version of the ban on imported ammunition clips to
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association had about a dozen lobbyists
working Capitol Hill against the stricter gun control alternatives
while Hand Gun Control, a gun control group, had set up phone banks
to urge gun control advocates to call Congress. Both sides have
also been running radio ads in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the Senate, where the breadth of a lawmaker's
constituency leads to a broad view, House members represent
smaller, more homogeneous areas. This makes geography destiny when
it comes to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   So representatives from the cities and their nearby suburbs
generally vote for gun control, including most Democrats and at
least 20 to 30 Republicans. Southerners as well as lawmakers from
the western mountain states and rural areas generally vote against
stringent gun restrictions, including most Republicans and 30 to 40
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Republican nor Democratic party leaders were trying to
make the renegades vote with their party, because of the
recognition that they were making the vote they needed to represent
their district and keep their seat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the bulk of the lobbying attention was focusing on a
particular group of House members caught in a vise: Republicans and
Democrats whose congressional districts encompass both rural areas
and suburbs, forcing them to balance the views of avid gun owners
against those of increasingly militant suburban parents fearful of
school violence.
</P>
<P>
   These 35 or so people _ perhaps 20 Republicans and 15 Democrats
_ will be key to deciding whether the House passes the same kinds
of gun control measures as the Senate did last month or waters down
the restrictions by defeating some of them and putting in place a
less stringent requirement for criminal background checks on
weapons sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday night, Dingell was saying he thought he could draw
a total of more than 40 Democrats to his side, and the gun control
advocates were fearing that as many as 45 Democrats would bolt from
the party. Republican strategists said they thought no more than 35
Republicans would defect to support Mrs. McCarthy's gun show
amendment.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Producing opera is a notoriously expensive
undertaking. The biggest budget item, especially for smaller
companies, is hiring union orchestra musicians for rehearsals and
performances. Many fledgling companies have been sunk by the
expense.
</P>
<P>
   This nearly was the fate of Operaworks, a small but determined
company founded in 1983 by David Leighton, a conductor and coach
who began his career in the 1970s as an assistant chorus master and
assistant conductor at the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last 10 years, while other companies have been
struggling to raise money to pay musicians, Operaworks has been
bypassing the cost with a controversial technological alternative,
the ``virtual orchestra,'' as the company's publicity materials
call it: in effect, a computer-realized electronic substitute.
</P>
<P>
   An artistic travesty? No doubt many opera fans and critics will
be appalled by the very idea of a virtual orchestra and dismayed by
its oddly processed sound. But Leighton, 48, says that his little
company is blazing a path to the techno-musical future and that
other smaller companies will soon be following suit.
</P>
<P>
   And although Operaworks is making scant money, the company
manages to present 8 to 12 staged productions a year, often of
unusual repertory, for modest-sized but seemingly loyal audiences.
The curious can hear for themselves when the company concludes its
current Strauss festival with a performance of ``Ariadne auf
Naxos'' on Friday night at the West-Park church on Amsterdam Avenue
and 86th Street.
</P>
<P>
   So how does the virtual orchestra work? And more important, how
does it sound? To find out, I attended a recent Operaworks
performance of ``Salome'' and afterward visited with J. Patrick
Casey, the company's general factotum, who directs the productions,
designs the sets, sometimes translates librettos into English, and
programs and runs the virtual orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   During performances Leighton stands before the stage to conduct
the singers. There is no orchestra pit at West-Park church; that
does not matter, since the company uses no orchestra. The virtual
equivalent is in the rear balcony where Casey mans a computer,
following the performance by watching Leighton. But the real work
has been done already.
</P>
<P>
   The actual sounds of the instruments are taken from a series of
CD-ROMs _ samplers, as they are called. One CD will contain nothing
but, say, the digitally recorded sounds of a clarinetist playing
long, sustained expression-neutral pitches, right up the chromatic
scale. These disks cost about $300 to $400 each, though more
expensive ones are available.
</P>
<P>
   A standard $4,000 sequencer, a mixer with 16 tracks, and of
course the computer are the essential components of the orchestral
music. Basically, Casey enters every single note, every line of the
complex Strauss score into the computer by playing it on a silent
keyboard which borrows sounds from the sampler CDs. So, for
example, the slinky, insinuating solo clarinet line that ``Salome''
begins with is performed by Casey at the keyboard with the desired
tempo, dynamics, articulations and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bank of about 30 sounds,'' Casey explained,
``strings, strings playing pizzicato, flute, trumpet, cymbal
crashes, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the information into the computer is a time-devouring
process. Casey estimates that he must spend on average three or
four hours for each minute of music. So ``Salome,'' a two-hour
opera, could take anywhere from 360 to a staggering 600 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Once completed, Casey ``performs'' the score by simply sitting
at the computer, punching keys and controlling the flow as the
music emits from speakers placed discreetly around the stage. Casey
and Leighton make much of the fact that tempos, phrasing and shape
in the virtual orchestra are worked out carefully during rehearsals
with the singers and that tempo, at least, can be adjusted by Casey
during a performance. But to do more than slight adjustments on the
spot is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   And dynamics, once set, are fixed. Gone, it would seem, is the
possibility for a singer to shape a phase in performance with a
slightly different inflection from what she did in rehearsal,
trusting that an alert conductor and sensitive orchestra players
will catch the difference and respond accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   As for the sound of the virtual orchestra, those listeners
accustomed to hearing orchestra tracks on pop and rock records and
in film scores, where this computer audio technology is most
common, will probably have an easier time accepting a virtual
orchestra's performance of ``Salome.'' I found it weird.
</P>
<P>
   Even when, say, a clarinet sounded sort of like a clarinet, the
tone seemed synthetic. The strings have an accordionlike quality.
Crescendos have a way of leaping out at you. One reminded me of
when the organist at Yankee Stadium gives an unintended extra nudge
to the swell pedal and a clipped chord jumps out of a melodic line
in an odd place (``Take me out  &UR; to &LR;  the ball game'').
</P>
<P>
   At full volume, Strauss' low brass and horns had a buzzing
quality, like the rude, blasting sounds made by the alien spaceship
in ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' when it answers the
earthlings' five-note musical greeting. And because the sound emits
from speakers, the spatial separation of instruments that is the
hallmark of a live orchestra is gone. Admittedly ``Salome,'' with
its famously voluptuous orchestration, is particularly hard to
replicate virtually. But Operaworks chose it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Leighton says that once composers get accustomed to the virtual
orchestra, they will start to compose for it, or at least
incorporate its resources into the standard orchestra. But
composing new music for this new technology is one thing. Trying to
recreate the sound of a Mozart or Strauss orchestra with
computerized, rhythmically constricting high-tech resources, no
matter how sophisticated, will always be frustrating, like getting
a kiss over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the musicians' union, Local 802, which is fiercely
protective of its members' rights and the status quo, has paid
little attention to Operaworks productions. The virtual orchestra
must seem an unlikely threat to the livelihood of classical
musicians. But that's what pop musicians once thought. Orchestras
were once used regularly for everything from soaring string tracks
on Motown songs to disco. Nowadays, if the sound of an orchestra is
desired in pop, it is as likely provided by digital keyboards and
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Operaworks would seem for now to be almost alone among classical
organizations in adopting this technology. Expect virtual
instruments to invade the Broadway orchestra pit, already the
domain of digital keyboards and ear-numbing amplification systems.
</P>
<P>
   Leighton is quick to compare his use of a virtual orchestra
favorably to the occasional use by many ballet companies of
recordings in place of live musicians. ``We are one step up from
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not entirely a fair comparison. For example, during
the recent two-week Stravinsky festival at the New York City
Ballet, the company's fine orchestra had to prepare 18 difficult
Stravinsky scores. In two additional cases the company used
recordings: the complex ``Movements for Piano and Orchestra'' and
``Les Noces,'' with a cumbersome scoring involving full chorus and
four pianos, far too cumbersome for an orchestra pit. Most critics
would say this represented a fair compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Casey says the high cost of hiring union orchestras is
``strangling opera in America.'' Actually opera is thriving in the
United States as never before, and a lot more can be accomplished
if smaller companies concentrate on less well-known or small-scale
works and let the major houses take care of ``Parsifal'' and
``Salome.''
</P>
<P>
   Leighton maintains that, by using a virtual orchestra, his
company can focus on developing a close ensemble of singing actors.
But the Operaworks performance of ``Salome'' was woefully uneven
vocally, with a gifted soprano in the title role who probably
should not have been attempting this famously taxing music and a
couple of singers in supporting roles who were undone by the vocal
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to recruit solid singers into something that
looks so gimmicky. Leighton should consider whether in his desire
to direct a company he is giving young singers chances or leading
them astray.
</P>
<P>
   As opera becomes more popular, there will be increased pressure
to make it less expensive and more accessible. As in pop music, the
virtual orchestra may creep into the field.
</P>
<P>
   What's the harm? My unscientific polling after a ``Salome''
performance found many people either intrigued by the virtual
orchestra or blase about it. One man who professed enthusiasm
claimed to be an avid operagoer.
</P>
<P>
   We have virtual special effects in the movies, virtual
simulations of space travel at science parks and now the virtual
orchestra. What next? A virtual soprano to sing Salome? Don't
laugh. It may be coming. &QL;

ASTROS MANAGER HAS SUCCESSFUL BRAIN SURGERY  
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TODD ACKERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Astros manager Larry Dierker had successful brain
surgery Tuesday to remove a life-threatening mass of tangled blood
vessels that had caused his seizure in Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rob Parrish, who performed the surgery at Methodist
Hospital, said he was confident he removed the entire malformation
and wants Dierker to convalesce for four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Parrish added, ``we'll evaluate on a week-to-week basis if
he's ready to manage.'' But he said he sees no reason why Dierker
shouldn't return this year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess how well the operation went on a 1 to 10 scale,
the surgeon said 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing very well,'' Parrish said. ``He's awake and alert
and he even makes sense when he talks. He gave me a high-five after
the surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Parrish removed the problem blood vessels, known as
arteriovenous malformation (AVM), from the frontal lobe in the
right side of Dierker's brain during a five-hour surgery. Pathology
confirmed the clot contained no tumor.
</P>
<P>
   After determining that Dierker's remaining vessels still had an
abnormal blood flow, doctors found a second area of malformation
and removed it.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said the blood vessels likely ruptured a few days before
Dierker's seizure and could have killed him. AVM is the
second-leading cause of fatal brain hemorrhaging, behind aneurysms.
About 17 percent of victims die the first time it happens.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, 52, collapsed in the dugout during the eighth inning of
the Houston-San Diego game at the Astrodome. He went into violent
seizures and was tended to by paramedics before taken by ambulance
to Methodist.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said Dierker should make a full recovery now. He will
spend another day bedridden in intensive care and remain in the
hospital 5-10 days. He will have an angiogram _ an X-ray of the
blood vessels _ in a few days and again in about a year to make
certain everything is out.
</P>
<P>
   Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. and general manager Gerry
Hunsicker, who were at the hospital, expressed their relief, as did
players and coaches at the Dome before Tuesday night's game with
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best we had hoped for,'' McLane said. ``This is
great progress and we rejoice in the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker described Dierker as very positive when he visited him
after the surgery _ ``he was smiling and gave the thumbs-up sign.''
But he said it was ``ridiculous'' to set a timetable for Dierker's
return to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Interim manager Matt Galante said that ``everything since Sunday
has been good, positive news. Yesterday they talked about what they
were going to do, today they did the operation and everything
turned out well. It's been uplifting because Sunday was a really
down day for us.''
</P>
<P>
   For surgery Parrish described as ``treacherous,'' the mood at
the news conference afterward was decidedly light. Parrish said
Dierker asked before the surgery whether this means ``no more
head-butts?''
</P>
<P>
   Needling Dierker about his predilection for aggressive
base-running, Parrish wondered after the surgery if he got out the
part of the manager's brain that allowed stealing third base with
two outs. Parrish said he hoped he got it out, but Dierker
responded that no, the surgeon must not have removed it because he
still plans to steal in such situations.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish, who has known Dierker for a few years, said Dierker was
``pumped up'' for the surgery and had no fear about it. Dierker
joked with Parrish that people usually tell you, ``Don't worry, it
isn't brain surgery. But this is brain surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy goes through a seizure, has brain surgery and he's
still able to joke around, said Astros second baseman Craig Biggio.
``That's typical Dierk. That`s why everyone loves him so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure required Parrish to cut a ``window'' in Dierker's
skull. After removing the malformation, Parrish put the bone flap
back over the window with 19 titanium screws and four
micro-titanium plates. They will stay there permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said the malformation was about 4-by-3 centimeters _ or
``bigger than a walnut, smaller than a lemon, maybe the size of a
lime or a really big jalapeno. Larry would like that.''
</P>

NOT EVEN HOPE FLOWERS IN A VILLAGE OF THE DEAD

<P>
   VELIKA KRUSA, Yugoslavia _ Ajrulah Ramadani woke up early
Tuesday in Albania, packed a small plastic bag of clothes and came
back to Kosovo. He is a relatively prosperous man who lived here on
a farm with his three brothers and their families _ 43 people in
all _ and he wanted to see if anything was left.
</P>
<P>
   The first person he met was Hamit Hoti, 85. Hoti's hands held a
cane, his feet rested on the fallen gutter of his house. The house
had no roof. The dried-up body of a dog, a bullet hole in his side,
lay a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you safe?'' Ramadani, 39, asked the old man. ``Do you
recognize me? I am Shaban's son.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoti looked confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recognize the young people anymore,'' he said. ``I am
blind. I am an old man. Are you safe?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, thank you,'' Ramadani said. He offered a cigarette. The
two men smoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hiding like a dog,'' Hoti said. ``I was running. For two
days I was hiding anywhere I could in the fields and other houses _
without food, without water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where my family is,'' he told Ramadani. ``Have
you seen any of my family?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came from Albania,'' Ramadani said. ``Lots of your
family is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoti wavered somewhere between tears and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's enough for me to know they are safe,'' he said. ``Thank
you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramadani said: ``We won. We won. We won.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he met Xhelal Duraku, 35, who had been hiding in a nearby
village until Tuesday. They walked up a grassy hill, thick with
wildflowers, then down a small slope. They smelled rotting flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Duraku climbed down the slope, which abutted the top of another
roofless house, and pulled two charred watches from a cinder block.
The watches belonged to the two men in the mounds of dirt at his
feet. A shoulder bone poked from a mound.
</P>
<P>
   Duraku said two of his relatives _ Isa Duraku, a teacher, and
Nuhi Duraku, the director of a cooperative farm _ were buried there
by other villagers, who told him where the watches were hidden.
</P>
<P>
   He said his relatives were killed by Serbs in a massacre in this
village _ where as many as 150 people died, human rights officials
say _ and their bodies partly burned. In the house below lay an ash
pit of bones, which a German soldier who walked by later said
seemed to belong to a goat. Down the hill, near the main road, is a
graveyard with recently plowed dirt, some 10 by 20 yards in size.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it all happened,'' Duraku said. Like Ramadani
and his family, he fled while the killings were going on.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadani went down the gravel road toward his house. A rotting
body of a cow lay crumpled next to a destroyed car. A frightened
Rottweiler poked his head out of a school, the windows smashed, the
filing cabinets ransacked, and then went back inside.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadani walked up a slope and peered around a wall to see his
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bulldozer is here,'' he said. ``I had three trucks.'' He
looked again. ``Ah, the trucks are gone. Also the tractors aren't
here. Only this bulldozer _ no _ one tractor is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought this piece of land from a Serb 10 years ago. I paid
800,000 German marks. Now they have come back and look what they
did.''
</P>
<P>
   He spat. The two houses where he and his brothers and their
families lived were barely standing. Both roofs were gone, the
windows were smashed out and carbon licked the paint around the
frames. The ground was spattered with red roof tiles.
</P>
<P>
   A skinny dog jumped from the basement. Ramadani looked happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meca, come here!'' he said, and the dog came and he scratched
her head. ``Meca!''
</P>

   He lit another cigarette. He started to go up his front porch,
spilling over with burned shoes, but thought better of it. It might
be booby trapped. Tears filled his eyes. His brothers' laundry was
still on the line. A sock hung on a tree.

   He wiped his face and said his next step was to let his family,
living in someone else's apartment in Albania, know that nothing is
left.

   The self-described owner of the world's biggest pornographic Web
site, Ocean Fund International, contended on Tuesday in a release
on PR Newswire that it had offered to buy the eight Caesars casinos
from Park Place Entertainment for $3.6 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   But Starwood Hotels and Resorts, which agreed in April to sell
the casinos to Park Place Entertainment for $3 billion, said it did
not receive any such offer, nor was Park Place aware of one.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dow Jones news service said that Ocean Fund was
not registered as a mutual fund in the British Virgin Islands, as
it had stated. And by the end of the day, PR Newswire asked Ocean
Fund's lawyer for proof it had sent its offer to Starwood and Park
Place by certified mail, as it also contended. But that proof was
not forthcoming by Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street appeared unmoved by the release. Starwood shares
rose 43.75 cents on Tuesday, to $36.875, while those of Park Place
fell 18.75 cents, to $9.50.

   ``After following gambling stocks for 10 years,'' said Jason

 &HT;    Baptist convention notebook: PETA protests fast food speaker

   ATLANTA _ With protesters near the Georgia Dome proclaiming that
``Jesus was a vegetarian,'' Chick-Fil-A-King Truett Cathy welcomed
Southern Baptists to Atlanta on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy left a little stuffed cow on the podium from the company's
``Eat More Chicken'' advertising campaign. It quickly became known
as the ``holy cow.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, from People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, included a man dressed as Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   PETA also has its message on a billboard that greeted Baptists
as they arrived for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of billboards, by the beginning of the convention, more
than 5,000 people had called a toll-free number appearing on
billboards and included in television, radio and newspaper
advertisements sponsored by the Southern Baptist Convention. The
campaign is part of ``Arms Around Atlanta,'' a joint effort of the
Southern Baptist North American Mission Board, the Georgia Baptist
Convention and several local Baptist associations.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptists, who have a reputation as tee-totalers, were
asked to go on the record with abstinence Tuesday by signing cards
pledging not to use alcohol or illegal drugs. Pushing the effort
was the Rev. Ted Stone, a North Carolina preacher who once served
four years in prison for shooting a man. Stone was hooked on
amphetamines at the time. ``We're trying to reach out and convince
people that a sober, self-controlled lifestyle is the best,'' he
said. Stone walked across the country twice, Washington to L.A. in
1996 and San Francisco ito Virginia Beach in 1998, to promote
sobriety.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpharetta, Ga.-based North American Mission Board of the
Southern Baptist Convention is unveiling a high-tech ``Vision
Center'' today. The center, a 5,000 square foot, $1.2 million
facility housed in the board's headquarters promises ``a phenomenal
interactive educational theme-park experience'' that propel
visitors ``through a global time capsule of past and present
mission fields.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Garner Clark from Autaugaville, Ala. always enjoys
attending the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention.
``It's a chance for preachers to get preached to,'' Garner said
Tuesday. And that's good news for members of Garner's church. They
``always tell me my preaching improves when I come home from these
conventions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman whose voice you couldn't quite hear during a concert
at Centennial Park Tuesday night was Pamela Valle of Bedford, Tex.
She was to take part in the evening event but lost her voice after
getting caught in thunderstorms that moved across Atlanta Monday
afternoon. Valle, who is the secretary-treasurer of the Conference
of Southern Baptist Evangelists, decided to take part in the
concert anyway. ``I'll just be lip-synching,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hoyle is spending some of his free time in Atlanta,
trying to make a good impression. Hoyle, pastor of Sharon Baptist
Church in Rural Retreat, Va., says he's getting to know people from
Atlanta that he meets in downtown hotels and restaurants. ``I want
people to see Southern Baptists as spiritual people who really care
about others,'' he said Tuesday. ``People are suprised when we
don't grab them and tell them they are going to hell.''

Baptist Convention from outside the Georgia Dome can log onto a

ANOTHER COMPANY TAKES THE `HONG KONG' OUT OF ITS NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Score another one for globalism over localism. Hong
Kong's local telephone company, Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd.,
said Tuesday that it would change its name to Cable and Wireless
HKT to tighten ties with its London-based parent company, Cable and
Wireless PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong Telecom said the new name was intended to convey the
company's broader ambitions as a supplier of Internet connections
and electronic commerce, as well as traditional telephone services,
throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are rooted in Hong Kong and will continue to focus on Hong
Kong with investment,'' said Linus Cheung, the chief executive of
Hong Kong Telecom, at a news conference. But he added, ``For the
future performance of our company, we will have to move out of Hong
Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   To some people here, the move is more discouraging evidence that
Hong Kong is losing its brand-name prestige as a commercial center.
Last November, HSBC Holdings, the parent of the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank, announced plans to drop the ``Hongkong'' from the
English name of its flagship bank in favor of the HSBC
abbreviation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time the Hong Kong name is removed from a major company,
you reduce the publicity for Hong Kong,'' said Ian Perkin, the
chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. ``It
downgrades the world's perception of Hong Kong, which is
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkin also questioned Hong Kong Telecom's decision to tie its
image to Cable and Wireless, a 127-year-old British company that
cobbled together its global network by constructing telephone
operations in onetime British colonies, from the Caribbean to India
to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable and Wireless is a company that followed the British
Empire around the world,'' he said, ``The name seems to be a
throwback.''
</P>
<P>
   To Hong Kong Telecom, however, the Cable and Wireless name
symbolizes a thoroughly modern company no longer wholly dependent
on either its home market or traditional voice communications. Its
ventures outside Hong Kong include building the first fiber optic
cable linking Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong Telecom's nonvoice services range from fax and data
transmission to Internet access and interactive television. Voice
communications generate only 40 percent of the company's profits,
Cheung said, and that figure could fall to 25 percent in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision is to make Hong Kong the Internet hub and
e-commerce center of Asia,'' Cheung said, noting that the company
had spent $2.58 billion (United States) to upgrade its networks
here.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the name change might have been dictated more
by corporate imperatives in London. Although Cable and Wireless had
one of the first genuinely global telecommunications networks,
investors have not rewarded the company with a commensurate
valuation in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't getting credit for it because most of the assets
weren't named for Cable and Wireless,'' said Lloyd Fischer, a
telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer predicted that the name change would have little effect
in the home market because the company would not be changing its
Chinese name, which translates as ``Hong Kong Telecom.'' More than
95 percent of Hong Kong's residents are Chinese. HSBC also kept the
Chinese name of the Hong Kong bank.

PLANNED KOREAN SHARE ISSUE ANGERS A BIG U.S. HEDGE FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Includes material budgeted earlier as JAPAN-MARKETS) 
(HLW) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A leading American hedge fund that has prominently
invested in South Korea's rebounding economy is protesting a plan
by the nation's biggest mobile phone operator to issue more shares.
</P>
<P>
   The objection from Tiger Management LLC, operated by the
well-known fund manager Julian H. Robertson, calls the plan by SK
Telecom unfair because the larger SK group may benefit
disproportionately. Tiger's complaint is regarded as another in a
series of signs that the momentum of South Korea's economic
modernization is slowing as the country regains financial strength.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger said on Tuesday that it was calling for a special
shareholders meeting on the matter and threatened to take its case
to court if SK Telecom's board did not cancel the plan to issue
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Jung-dong, a spokesman for SK Telecom, said on Tuesday that
the company's board had approved the plan. He expressed surprise at
Tiger's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that such a complaint has been made against SK Telecom
_ which has been regarded as an example of how foreign investors
can impose Western-style corporate governance and disclosure on
Asian companies _ is one measure of how unhappy those investors are
becoming. SK Telecom's minority investors, in addition to winning
the right to recommend outside directors, had succeeded in
appointing an outside auditor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps feeding such unhappiness, the government has delayed
selling two big banks it nationalized in the financial crisis,
which took hold in December 1997 and required a $58 billion aid
package from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the government said it was dissatisfied with the
offers made in its second attempt at selling Korea Life Insurance
and announced a third round of bidding. The first attempt failed
when the government's terms scared away big foreign insurers like
Metropolitan Life and AXA of France.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, officials said they might reopen bidding for a 25
percent stake in Korea Gas, a state-owned monopoly, because bidders
including the Osaka Gas Co. of Japan and BG PLC of Britain had not
met its price demands or reached an agreement on management
participation.
</P>
<P>
   There is concern among foreign investors that the rights
offering is an attempt to prevent them from increasing their stake
in the company when the government lifts the restrictions on
foreign ownership of telecommunications companies to 49 percent
from the current 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They say the SK group is worried that if foreigners own such a
substantial part of SK Telecom, the company may slip from its
control.

SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES LOOKING FOR PLANT SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Superior Industries International Inc. said
Tuesday it has won multiyear contracts worth an annual $250 million
and plans to build a new plant to handle all the new business
coming its way.
</P>
<P>
   Among the deals, Superior will provide its aluminum wheels for
the 2000 models of the Mercury Sable, Chevrolet Suburban/Tahoe, GMC
Yukon, Oldsmobile Intrigue, Buick Regal, Cadillac DeVille and BMW
Z3 Coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Superior had already been supplying some of these models, and
the contract calls for providing redesigned wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the company will supply wheels for a new car or light
truck that R. Jeffrey Ornstein, company vice president and chief
financial officer, said he was not permitted by the maker to
identify.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company is casting about for a place to build a
new plant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just now searching plant sites,'' Ornstein said. ``It
will definitely be in North America and probably an important
consideration will be geographical proximity to one of our existing
plants.''
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to open it by September 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Superior's plants are in suburban Van Nuys, where the company is
also headquartered; Fayetteville and Rogers, Ark.; Johnson City,
Tenn.; Pittsburg, Kan.; and Chihuahua, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter ended March 31, the company earned $15.5
million, or 57 cents per diluted share, compared with last year's
$12.8 million, or 46 cents per diluted share. Revenues were $136.9
million vs. the previous year's $136.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Superior is expanding its Van Nuys plant's capacity by
about 20 percent, according to Ornstein. The expansion includes
installing more equipment and possibly boosting the plant's work
force, which now numbers about 750. About 150 people work in the
headquarters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has about 4,500 employees worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The new contracts, and the fact that the company needs another
plant, indicates Superior's solid place in the market for wheels,
said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an industry analyst at Lehman Brothers in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just consistent with the fact that their
customers recognize them as a great supplier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wall Street was unimpressed with Superior's announcement.
Shares of the company increased only 18.75 cents to $24 on 75,900
shares traded.

SHAREHOLDERS CHARGE EXTORTION IN RUSSIAN FAR EAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Foreign investors in Far Eastern Shipping Co. of Russia
have accused a top politician of using extortion to try to wrest
away their stakes in the concern, causing a shareholder rights
scandal that is the latest of several to erode the weak faith
remaining in the Russian equities market.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Vladivostok, Far Eastern Shipping is the nation's
largest commercial shipping line and is 42 percent owned by foreign
investors. Andrew Fox, chairman of a Vladivostok brokerage firm,
Tiger Securities, and a Far Eastern Shipping board member
representing nearly all foreign investors, said in a telephone
interview Tuesday that the provincial governor, Yevgeny
Nazdratenko, summoned him June 3 to express displeasure with the
extent of foreign ownership in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said Nazdratenko demanded that foreign stockholders
surrender at least 7 percent of their shares to him, and he vowed
to limit foreigners' voting rights at companies in his Primorsky
region. If Fox failed to comply, he quoted Nazdratenko as saying,
he would face imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone early Wednesday, , Nazdratenko's press
secretary, Natalya Vstovskaya, said she could not confirm that he
had met with Fox, and that ``if there was a discussion, I hardly
think the discussion had anything to do with Nazdratenko's own
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Other foreigners briefed on the meeting said Fox's account was
credible.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the nationalist overtones, the attempt to grab these
shares may have monetary motives. Gubernatorial elections in
Primorsky are scheduled in December, and it is not unheard of for
incumbents to take over local companies and use their cash flow to
finance campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really not about foreigners, though that plays well as
far as the public is concerned,'' said Fox, who has worked in
Vladivostok since 1993. He said Far Eastern Shipping, ``as one of
the biggest and richest companies in the region, is one worth
having influence over.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is just the most recent instance of conflict between
major Russian companies and foreign shareholders. The oil
conglomerate Sidanko is in bankruptcy and BP Amoco, one of its
major shareholders, is struggling to have a say in the process and
to recoup some of its investment. Another oil concern, Yukos, has
been accused of trying to dilute minority shareholdings with new
stock issues.
</P>
<P>
   Privatized Russian companies, used to decades of secrecy under
communism and to running things their own way, have proved hostile
to outsiders. Theft and currency flight are rampant at businesses,
and outside shareholders often threaten to halt such activities.
</P>
<P>
   When the Russian stock market performed well, few investors
cared about corporate governance because there was money to be made
without getting involved in such tricky questions, said James
Fenkner, an equity strategist with the Moscow brokerage firm Troika
Dialog. But since default and devaluation last summer devastated
their holdings, investors have sought to recoup as much of their
money as possible _ which brings them into conflict with big
shareholders, managers and the powers backing them.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial threats have not been followed by further
harassment, Fox, who is also British honorary consul for the
Russian Far East, said he felt endangered.
</P>
<P>
   The British Embassy in Moscow will send a letter of complaint to
the Russian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday , Fox said. An embassy
spokeswoman confirmed only ``that Mr. Fox has been in consultations
with the embassy on how to proceed on the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Though representing foreign shareholders, Fox and his firm hold
a negligible stake themselves in Far Eastern Shipping, whose market
value is estimated at $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   A new board, elected in late May, wants to insure more openness
in the company's financial practices and determine why Far Eastern
Shipping continues to lose money despite strong revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In their meeting, Fox said, Nazdratenko gave him a week to
convene yet another shareholders meeting and elect a different
board and chairman more to his liking. Two generals from a security
service and the police were present at the discussion, Fox said,
and ``I was told that a general would take me on a tour of the
local prisons so I could see where I'd end up if I didn't comply.''

JUDGE AWARDS USC $720,000 JUDGMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ruled that
a company owned by radio broadcasters Larry Kahn and Mike Lamb owes
USC at least $720,000 for breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Richard C. Hubbell ruled in a summary judgment that KLM
Sports, Inc. _ an enterprise primarily owned by Kahn and Lamb _ is
required to pay the six-figure amount under the terms of a
three-year radio contract with USC that expired last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain amounts of payments were guaranteed to the university
and not made,'' USC general counsel Todd Dickey said. ``It was
clear they had breached the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn, who is currently a broadcaster for the Anaheim Angels,
said he was unhappy with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very strongly we have a strong case and the judge
didn't see it that way,'' Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   USC ended its relationship with Kahn and Lamb, and signed a
three-year deal with XTRA-AM (690) that began last football season.
</P>
<P>
   The case still has several other phases. Kahn and Lamb are suing
USC for defamation, claiming they were slandered by athletic
director Mike Garrett, among others.
</P>
<P>
   USC has asked for a summary judgment in its favor on that issue,
and a hearing is scheduled in late July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said they owed us $720,000 and they said it was untrue. You
can see where we are going with this,'' said Dave Roberts, an
attorney representing USC on the case.
</P>
<P>
   USC has also filed a motion asking for a judgment against Kahn
and Lamb as individuals, in case KLM Sports has no assets to cover
the original ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principals should be liable, not just the corporation,''
Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said he has not decided if he will appeal the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That remains to be seen,'' Kahn said. ``The most disappointing
thing is we busted our butts for this school. It's just
disappointing.''

   SAN ANTONIO _ The New Jersey Nets offered him wheelbarrows of
cash and the New York Knicks tried to sell him on their future
during a clandestine meeting. But in the end, Phil Jackson decided
that the combination of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant beat
anything the New York metropolitan area offered.

   The official announcement, which is scheduled to come at a news
conference on Wednesday in Inglewood, Calif., ends months of
speculation and rumor surrounding the future of Jackson. According
to a person close to Jackson who requested anonymity, Jackson will
sign a deal worth nearly $30 million over five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' management structure will not change. Jerry West
remains the team president and Mitch Kupchak stays as general
manager, but Jackson will have a major role in personnel matters.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson will replace Kurt Rambis, who was promoted to interim
coach from assistant when Del Harris was fired as coach 12 games
into the season. Rambis will remain with the team; Jackson will
decide whether he will be part of the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   After a calamitous season that included the acquisition and
release of the tardy and troubled Dennis Rodman, the Lakers were
swept out of the playoffs for the second year in a row, losing in
the second round to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to inheriting two of the league's marquee players,
O'Neal and Bryant, Jackson will coach a team opening a new arena.
The Lakers have left the Great Western Forum and will play in the
new Staples Arena next season.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 53, had a 545-193 record in nine seasons at Chicago and
was 111-41 in the playoffs, the highest post-season winning
percentage of all NBA coaches.
</P>
<P>
   According to an Eastern Conference team official with knowledge
of Jackson's plans, he was genuinely interested in coaching the
Lakers, Nets and Knicks, but firmly believed that the Lakers' job
had more potential, based on their talent.
</P>
<P>
   West and Kupchak spoke by telephone to Jackson on Monday, after
he returned to Montana from an Alaskan fishing trip.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was already scheduled to be in Los Angeles on Wednesday
and Thursday to campaign for Bill Bradley, the former Knick and
U.S. senator now seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.

ADVERTISING: DIFFERENT TAKES ON BUDGET RENT-A-CAR'S ACCOUNT
REVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A funny thing happened on the way to the end of a review for a
large advertiser's creative account: the company and two agencies
traded conflicting versions of the final rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Budget Rent-a-Car Corp., a unit of Budget Group that rents and
sells vehicles, said Tuesday that it had ended the review, which
began in April, by selecting Cliff Freeman &AMP; Partners in New York
to handle the creative portion of the account. Billings were
estimated at $40 million to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   But just hours before Budget made that announcement, Fallon
McElligott in Minneapolis, one of four finalists in the review,
issued an unusual statement, saying it had decided to withdraw
after being told by Budget executives that it had been ``the
preferred choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Budget countered by asserting that Fallon McElligott had issued
the statement only because the agency had learned the account was
being awarded to Freeman, a unit of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the head of the Chicago office of Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney,
the incumbent agency on the creative account, weighed in, saying
Budget executives had assured him his agency was going to be kept
on _ until he received a call Wednesday disclosing Freeman's
selection.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement is indicative of the ferment roiling relations
between agencies and clients as accounts change hands faster and
more frequently than before.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there have been several disputes recently centered
on agencies that unexpectedly announced they were resigning
accounts. Those statements were challenged by the clients involved,
who countered that the agencies had neglected to mention that those
resignations had come only after the accounts were placed in
review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing surprises me in this business anymore,'' said Donny
Deutsch, chairman and chief executive at Deutsch Inc. in New York,
which had been a finalist in the Budget review before withdrawing
in May.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, Fallon McElligott attributed its withdrawal to
a failure to reach agreement on compensation after two weeks of
contract negotiations with Budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear, after many protracted conversations,'' said
Fallon McElligott chairman Patrick Fallon in the statement, ``that
Budget was not willing to enter into an agreement that from our
point of view made sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time in our 18-year history where a potential
partnership broke down based on financial considerations,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Mulcahy, a spokeswoman for Budget, which is based in
Lisle, Ill., replied that Freeman, not Fallon McElligott, was the
agency the company wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we had narrowed the review, we were in final rounds of
negotiations and discussions with both Fallon and Cliff Freeman,''
Ms. Mulcahy said. ``I think the bottom line was that Fallon got
wind they weren't the agency of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``By saying they were pulling out,'' she added, ``maybe they're
saving face. But I can't speak for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone who  &UR; can  &LR; speak for them _ Julie Thompson, a spokeswoman
for Fallon McElligott _ said the agency was ``disappointed'' by the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're told by the VP of marketing and the president and
the chairman that you're the agency, what part of that were we not
supposed to understand?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to be very clear and forthright about what
happened,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Another disappointed party was Barry Krause, president of
Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney in Chicago, part of Publicis SA. His agency
has handled the creative duties on the Budget account since July.
</P>
<P>
   Krause said he believed he would keep the account ``until this
morning,'' when Budget called to inform him of Freeman's selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continued to assure us we `blew them away''' in creative
and strategic presentations that were part of the review, he added.
``We've been sitting here asking each other, `If we were that
excellent, why haven't we heard something?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to do the right thing,'' Krause said, ``but
they're having a hard time creating a real partnership with an
agency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've gone through three agencies in three years,'' he
added, ``there's something wrong with the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Budget creative duties have been at three agencies
since January 1997: Freeman, Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney and Hill,
Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, a unit of Interpublic
Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Freeman, chairman and chief creative officer at Freeman,
said that he had been unaware of the contretemps between Fallon
McElligott and Budget until he had been briefed by his new client.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of amazing to me,'' Freeman said, adding: ``It seems
like sour grapes. You don't get the business, so you pull out? I've
got to try that next time.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a change affecting the media duties on the Budget
account. Media planning, which had been handled by Publicis &AMP; Hal
Riney, is being shifted to Starcom Media Services in Chicago, a
unit of Leo Burnett Co. that has already been handling media
buying.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the fourth finalist in the creative review was
GSD&AMP;M in Austin, Texas, a unit of Omnicom Group. Roy Spense, the
agency's president, had a succinct response when the dispute was
described to him: ``Wow.''

HONDA CIVIC TOPS WITH GEN-XERS, REPORT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGOURA HILLS, Calif. _ Generation X consumers prefer compact and
premium midsize vehicles, with their No. 1 choice being the Honda
Civic, according to a report released Tuesday by Agoura Hills-based
J.D. Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   But that 20- to 34-year-old group is a highly fragmented lot
and, thus, a tough bunch to market to _ which is something
carmakers are going to have to learn to do, as this group is
expected to constitute one-quarter to one-third of the car-buying
public by 2005, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the study found that older Gen-Xers rely on the Internet
to obtain information before buying a car much more frequently than
do 20- to 24-year-olds, who have less access to the Internet, are
first-time buyers and tend to turn to family and friends for input.
</P>
<P>
   ``One other interesting finding is that Generation X is more
willing to stretch its income to buy a vehicle,'' said Sara Wong
Hilton, manager of market analysis at Power's Detroit office, who
led the study.
</P>
<P>
   Gen-Xers will pay about 46 percent of their annual household
income on a new vehicle, vs. 35 percent for baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Lynda Sakamaki-Smith, spokeswoman for American Honda Motor Co.
Inc., said she wasn't surprised to hear that Honda models are among
Gen-Xers' favorites. The company has sold 129,531 1999 Civics
through May, and the median age is 28 for the sportier coupe model.
</P>
<P>
   About half the Civic buyers are single; 46.5 percent are male,
53.5 percent are female; and 55 percent are college graduates or
higher, spokeswoman Sakamaki-Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Generation X group sees (the Civic's) potential for fun,
but it's reliable at the same time,'' she said.

LITTON WILL PAY U.S. PENALTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Defense contractor Litton Industries Inc. will pay
a multimillion-dollar penalty to settle a lengthy federal
investigation into whether the company acted improperly when it
paid commissions to foreign consultants, sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los
Angeles could be disclosed as early as next week, said a person
familiar with talks between the company and the government.
</P>
<P>
   By paying the fine, Litton avoids having to defend itself
against federal criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the midst of discussions so we have no comment,''
said a Litton spokeswoman, who spoke only on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's Office also refused to discuss the case. It
has not formerly charged Litton, one of the nation's biggest
military shipbuilders and defense contractors, with any violations
of federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The case was first disclosed in the early 1990s and focuses on
Litton's business dealings with Richard Hei, a consultant familiar
with Taiwan's government and military officials.
</P>
<P>
   Hei worked for Litton and other companies in the 1980s and 1990s
on securing military contracts from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 17 filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Litton first disclosed that the U.S. Attorney intended
to bring criminal charges against the company and some present and
former officers and employees in connection with sales to Taiwan,
Greece and possibly South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Litton said that it started talking to federal officials in
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the company believes it has good and meritorious
defenses to the potential charges, the verdict in any trial cannot
be predicted with certainty,'' Litton said in the filing.
</P>
<P>
   The company again included this notice when it made its required
second quarterly SEC filing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills-based Litton is the nation's eighth-largest
defense and aerospace company. It builds warships and information
systems. The company recently outbid competitor Newport News
Shipbuilding for Avondale Industries Inc., a builder of noncombat
military ships.
</P>
<P>
   Litton share's closed Tuesday at $68.75, up 75 cents.

IMPROVED WOODS READY FOR A SERIOUS OPEN BID
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ At this point in Tiger Woods' young career,
the U.S. Open is the major championship that has given him the most
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In four appearances, Woods has never finished higher than 18th.
And in his 13 previous rounds at the Open, Woods has shot under par
just twice.
</P>
<P>
   At times, he has been too aggressive, hitting difficult shots
out of deep rough, which only led to more trouble. At times, he has
become frustrated, losing the patience necessary to win a
tournament where pars are precious and bogeys are to be expected.
But when the 99th U.S. Open begins Thursday morning, Woods will tee
off at Pinehurst Resort &AMP; Country Club's world-famous No. 2 course
with momentum, confidence, a different strategy and a different
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has been the world's best player this month, winning his
last two starts _ the Deutsche Bank SAP Open in Germany and the
Memorial Tournament, where Woods displayed a brilliant short game
under pressure to prevail by four strokes over Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   The months Woods spent sharpening his short game and improving
his distance control have not been wasted, and Woods' game suits
Pinehurst, where short-game ability and creativity will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Woods believes he has never been more ready to win an Open,
because he has never been a more complete player. With Woods,
expectations are always high. But this week, he hopes to turn those
expectations into results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The previous U.S. Opens, I wasn't as good a player as I needed
to be,'' said Woods. ``That's just plain and simple. In U.S. Opens,
if you hit the ball poorly, you're not going to be around.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons I changed my game to become more
consistent. When I do miss, it's not two fairways over like it used
to be. I kept telling everybody that I'm making changes in my game,
and it's going to take time. I'm learning how to play the game. I'm
only 23. I have a long way to go. But I've come a long way. I've
learned by watching other players. I've learned from my own
mistakes. But I think most importantly, I'm not afraid to apply
what I've learned.''
</P>
<P>
   While Woods will be one of the favorites, a long list of players
could contend. This will be an unusual Open, with wider fairways
and lower rough than normal, which could keep more players in the
hunt. It rained Tuesday at Pinehurst, and if it rains again
Wednesday, the greens will be even softer once the tournament
begins, allowing players to fire with more daring at the flag
sticks.
</P>
<P>
   But when Woods is playing well, he can win anywhere, and those
close to him sense his determination. Woods and Mark O'Meara are
sharing a house this week, and O'Meara was not about to bet against
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's hitting it as good as he can hit it,'' said
O'Meara. ``Tiger will play well this week because No. 1, he's
putting good, and No. 2, he's confident.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Memorial, Woods displayed the shot-making skills around
the greens that he will need to prevail at Pinehurst, where
chipping and putting will be crucial. When he is near the green,
expect to see Woods use his 3-wood to roll the ball close to the
hole, a creative play that has become one of his signature shots.
</P>
<P>
   And from past experiences at the Open, Woods has learned that it
is often better to accept bogeys rather than to try heroic shots
that can lead to bigger problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tiger has learned to be more patient,'' said Butch
Harmon, Woods' coach. ``After the 1997 Open, I sent Tiger a note
with two words on it _ chip out. He's gaining more and more
experience all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he didn't like the way he played in 1997, ``even
though I won some tournaments. I didn't like the fact I wasn't
consistent. Anybody can win when they're hot. But it's hard to win
when you're off.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Memorial on Sunday, I wasn't playing that well, but I
used my short game to my advantage to beat Vijay. A player may not
win every week, but they want to have a chance to win Sunday on the
back nine. I want to keep giving myself those chances.''

UCLA LANDS FIFTH RECRUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA landed its fifth recruit of the season last
weekend when Las Vegas center John Ream gave the Bruins a verbal
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Ream, a rising senior at Chapparal High School, is 6-4 and 285
pounds. He received scholarship offers from both Arizona schools,
Oregon and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have approximately 17 scholarships available, and
they hope to sign several offensive linemen to bolster a unit
depleted by injuries (Jeff Wright, Scott Wiegand), position change
(Steve Morgan) and academic trouble (Dave Wilford).
</P>
<P>
   Ream attended UCLA's one-day camp Saturday but did not
participate. Perhaps the best player was Sacramento receiver Willie
Dixon, who is considering UCLA and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Strong sales: There's no Heisman Trophy candidate, no lofty
preseason ranking and no opponent as strong as Texas tailback Ricky
Williams on the schedule. But business is brisk at UCLA's ticket
office.
</P>
<P>
   Through June 10, the Bruins were 2,900 season tickets ahead of
last year's pace, when they sold 34,400 _ the second-highest total
in school history, according to marketing director Scott Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bigger base than we did last year,'' Mitchell said.
``But not having Cade (McNown) and with the quarterback uncertain,
that plays in the back of people's minds. A lot of people will make
their mind up in August.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch for radio spots and freeway billboards to appear next
month. The Bruins are using a ``Do You Believe?'' marketing theme,
with a photo of All-American receiver Danny Farmer making a diving,
one-handed catch.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: UCLA opens with Boise State in the Rose Bowl on
Sept. 4 (Labor day weekend). Be prepared for a 7 p.m. kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State (Sept. 18) is the other nonconference home game.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing its renovation project, the Rose Bowl has added
concession stands and parking since last season, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Get your tickets now: Coach Bob Toledo should have his best team
in 2000, when the Bruins host Alabama and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket information: 310-UCLA-WIN.

 &HT;    Woodpeckers make golf course a love nest
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Always on the lookout for lovebirds, Peter
Campbell could hardly believe what he saw. Two red-cockaded
woodpeckers were flitting in a grove of longleaf pines.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist had longed for this
moment for 2 1/2 years, ever since he became chief matchmaker for
the endangered species of woodpeckers in North Carolina's
Sandhills.
</P>
<P>
   At the site of this week's U.S. Open golf championship, federal
officials, conservationists and private landowners who are
restoring the woodpeckers' habitat claim they've scored an
environmental hole in one.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, Campbell shared his binoculars with
golfers who were curious to see the darting black-and-white
woodpeckers. ``We have a potential breeding pair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The more exciting discovery of a love nest came a few days
later. Two baby birds were nestled in a hole their parents had
tapped in a pine tree.
</P>
<P>
   Reclaiming longleaf pine woods for red-cockaded woodpeckers was
the goal four years ago when Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
traveled to Pinehurst to unveil a program called Safe Harbor. The
first private landowner to sign up was Pinehurst, the company that
owns eight local golf courses, including the legendary No. 2 course
hosting the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, 24 additional landowners in the Sandhills _
including nine golf courses _ have joined Safe Harbor. They are
working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the nonprofit
Sandhills Ecological Institute to reclaim habitat for 50 groups of
red-cockaded woodpeckers. The latest tally found 34 groups in the
Pinehurst area.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's discovery of the nestlings was the most encouraging
development yet. ``It is the first instance of Safe Harbor doing
what it was set up to do _ creating new sites of birds,'' said
Kerry Brust, the ecological institute's senior biologist. The U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service is crowing about the woodpecker project
during this week's golf tournament. In coming months, the agency
plans to recommend Safe Harbor as a national model for protecting
other endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   One of Safe Harbor's rules is that property owners must clear
their longleaf pine groves of scrub oaks and underbrush. That
leaves an uncluttered, airy stand of pines, the habitat preferred
by red-cockaded woodpeckers.
</P>
<P>
   When underbrush grows as high as woodpeckers' nesting cavities,
it creates a natural ladder for predators such as black rat snakes.
That scares off the woodpeckers. In centuries past, natural fires
rid longleaf forests of underbrush. As people have moved into the
woodpeckers' habitat, fires have largely been stamped out. At the
same time, development and logging have eliminated more than 95
percent of the Southeast's original 92 million acres of longleaf
ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the number of red-cockaded woodpeckers had dwindled to
roughly 5,000 groups in 13 Southeastern states. The uncluttered
habitat preferred by the woodpeckers happens to be a neat fit for
the manner in which Pinehurst maintains the longleaf groves through
which its golf courses meander. By clearing underbrush, maintenance
crews make it easier for golfers who hit errant shots to retrieve
their balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would we not do something to enhance the species?'' said
Brad Kocher, Pinehurst's director of golf course maintenance who
eagerly endorsed Safe Harbor in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Harbor has critics, as do most federal programs to protect
endangered species. Some complain about the cost in tax dollars _
more than $800,000 in the case of the Sandhills project.
</P>
<P>
   Near Pinehurst, sprawling Fort Bragg is home to the largest
number of red-cockaded woodpeckers, and Army officials there are
helping fund Safe Harbor. U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has
questioned whether U.S. military bases should concern themselves
with protecting birds at the risk of diverting attention from
training. Among the sharpest critics have been longleaf tree
farmers who fear the discovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers on their
property could prevent them from cutting trees in the birds'
habitat.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some property owners took steps _ including
clear-cutting longleaf acreage _ to discourage the woodpeckers from
returning to their land. Safe Harbor is the brainchild of the
Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit conservation group. It
promises worried property owners that if they agree to take steps
to encourage the woodpeckers to move in, the government will not
prevent them from developing the property.Chris Burritt writes for

BUSINESS TRAVEL: GOING BY RAIL; SIDE TRIPS; TWOFERS IN BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're going where the tracks go, the train can be a
realistic, pleasant alternative to air travel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the train doesn't have anywhere near the reach of the
plane. But for business travelers who happen to be headed where the
train tracks go, the railroad offers a realistic alternative to the
dread airport departure lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a report on one recent business trip on Amtrak's
Metroliner, which travels between New York City and Washington,
D.C.:
</P>
<P>
   The train departed precisely on time. Seats were large
(comparable to business-class seats on an airplane), with big
pull-down trays and 120-volt outlets for electronic gear.
Throughout the trip, computers and cellular phones were widely in
use (though, in the case of cell phones, not ostentatiously).
</P>
<P>
   In the first-class car, the seats were the same as coach, but
attendants served free drinks and a hot meal or sandwich and
snacks. Arrival was exactly on time three hours later at
Washington's bustling Union Station. The ride was smooth and
pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   According to Amtrak, more business travelers are opting to go by
rail, at least on the well-trod Metroliner route between New York
and Washington. Last year, 2.1 million passengers took the
Metroliner; so far this year, ridership is up more than 6 percent,
according to an Amtrak spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of its growing popularity with business
travelers, the Metroliner makes a profit of about $10 million a
year for Amtrak, which recently announced an ambitious revamping of
the service. Starting late this year, the Metroliner will be called
Acela, with routes expanded to cover the whole Boston-New
York-Washington corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Metroliner fares are competitive with those for air travel, an
important consideration for many business travelers and employers,
who cringe at the huge disparity between air fares for unrestricted
business travel and discounted leisure travel. On the airlines, for
example, typical business fares now are nearly four times higher
than the lowest discounted leisure fares (whereas three years ago,
they were only about two and a half times higher), according to the
American Express Business Airfare Index.
</P>
<P>
   The weekday round-trip Metroliner fare from New York to
Washington is $230 ($376 for the first-class accommodations, which
means that the meal, drinks and extra service cost a very pricey
$146). Unrestricted round-trip fares on both the Delta Air Lines
and US Airways shuttles from New York to Washington are $404.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the train-plane fare difference is far more
pronounced in California, which generously subsidizes some Amtrak
routes. The round-trip fares on the Amtrak San Diegan trains
between San Diego and Los Angeles, for example, are $50 ($72 for
business class). By air, UAL's United Express and Skywest
round-trip fares from Los Angeles to San Diego are $226.
</P>
<P>
   Side Trips
</P>
<P>
   Summer travel season is here, with mounting stresses on
air-traffic control. Late Monday afternoon, flight controllers
contending with thunderstorms in the Midwest ordered 50-mile
intervals between all flights converging on New York City, with
delays of an hour or more as flights piled up all across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, this is a recipe for more tension between
long-suffering air travelers and haughty airlines, especially when
a flight has left the gate only to idle interminably on the tarmac
while captive passengers fume at the lack of information and the
sit-down-and-shut-up attitude of the flight crew.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, however, on American Airlines Flight 1968 from Chicago
to Newark, N.J., on Monday afternoon. The cockpit crew and flight
attendants provided a textbook example of how to handle a long
delay with skill.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after announcing that the plane had been held
indefinitely on the ground in Chicago, the captain came back on and
said, earnestly, ``Folks, I didn't know about this when we left the
gate or, believe me, we would not have left that gate.''
</P>
<P>
   The captain then invited passengers to use their cell phones.
Flight attendants passed out cold drinks and magazines, while
making an inventory of passengers' connecting flights. Every 10
minutes, the pilot came back on to describe what he did and did not
know about the delay. And more than an hour later, after the plane
finally took off, a flight attendant announced that the captain had
persuaded both American and Continental Airlines in Newark to hold
connecting flights to Britain in order to accommodate several dozen
passengers on the delayed flight from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot: Because of heads-up customer service, grumbles
turned to approval in the air. Most of the passengers actually
 &UR; thanked &LR;  the pilot as they filed out, well over an hour late.
</P>
<P>
   Twofers to Britain
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said Tuesday that it would offer a free
round-trip ticket to London with each seven-day advance-purchase
round-trip economy ticket bought before June 30 for summer travel.
(Sample round-trip fares for such British Airway tickets are: $598
from New York, $778 from Dallas and $798 from Los Angeles.)
</P>
<P>
   But there's a hitch: The free ticket is only good for travel
from Nov. 1, 1999, through March 31, 2000 (except Dec. 15 through
Jan. 15). This means the two tickets cannot be used together.
However, it's a good deal for a business traveler who has to make a
summer and winter trip to London. &QL;

 &HT;    Bush gleefully shaking hands with a crush of admirers
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DERRY, N.H. _ As television news soundman Ed Lewis stood outside
Madden's Family Restaurant and watched Gov. George W. Bush
gleefully shaking hands with a crush of admirers, he made a
comparison that might annoy Bush but which bodes well for his
chances of winning the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how Clinton was,'' marveled Lewis, who has covered four
New Hampshire primaries. ``It's rare that you see people who can be
that relaxed around so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bush stuck to his pledge to remain in Texas until
the end of the legislative session and didn't officially become a
candidate until Saturday, he has been dominating his Republican
rivals in the polls and in the chase for campaign cash. But he
hadn't yet strode upon a national stage, and his much-anticipated
first campaign trip attracted a media horde of about 200, poised to
pounce on any mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Bush showed himself to be an enthusiastic and disciplined
campaigner who plunged into crowds with Clintonian glee and stayed
remarkably ``on message.'' He deftly handled a potentially
dangerous Monday news conference with a slew of national media
heavyweights, many of whom came away impressed with his politicking
prowess _ so far.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't make one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He managed to get through it without any real nicks and cuts,
much less any gaping wounds,'' said Larry Sabato, a University of
Virginia political scientist. ``It doesn't mean anything. It's too
early. It is impossible to say whether he can sustain this
unbelievable momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   At every stop, Bush dutifully plugged away at his main themes:
lower taxes, education, ``compassionate conservatism,''
inclusiveness, hope, optimism. He made the same jokes (the Clinton
administration ``didn't invent prosperity any more than it invented
the Internet'') and hit the same applause lines (marrying Laura was
``the best decision I ever made''). He always spoke a few lines in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush barely mentioned any policy specifics, and
nearly all of the events during his four day trip to Iowa, Maine,
New Hampshire and Massachusetts were filled with people who already
support the governor. With a large lead in the polls _ a Boston
Herald poll during the trip put him at 45 percent, with Elizabeth
Dole and John McCain stuck at 11 percent _ he had nothing to gain
by taking stands on hot-button issues.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Smith, a pollster from the University of New Hampshire,
said Bush's numbers almost certainly will decline as takes specific
stands on issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I think there's a tendency among Republican voters
to look at George Bush and see themselves in him,'' Smith said.
``He can't be all things to all people.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents are counting on that. Ari Fleischer, spokesman for
Elizabeth Dole, was pleased that Bush took some heat on his first
trip for saying he would not use abortion as a ``litmus test'' in
selecting judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning of what is going to turn into the
challenges the governor is going to face as he defines himself.,''
said Fleischer. ``It's issues like that, as he takes stands, are
going to whittle down his great popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Bush arrived, the conservative and influential Manchester
Union Leader compared Bush to ``one of those minor Hollywood
celebrities who is famous for being famous.'' But there's no doubt
that star power goes a long way in a political campaign _
particularly in a Republican party that is desperate for a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got the charisma and energy and ideas to unify
the party and be a real strong candidate,'' said Karen Maiola, a
pre-school teacher from Bow, N.H. after hearing Bush speak at a
fire station there.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Skogland, a retired obstetrician from Rome, N.Y., drove
five hours to hear Bush at St. Anselm's College in Goffstown, N.H.
Like many of those at Bush events, he said he didn't know much
about Bush's record or stands on the issues. But, Skogland said,
``He's the man, and I think he's going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the little things that counted. At the Bow fire station,
he removed his jacket with a comic flair that drew chuckles from
the audience. He dropped his ``g's'' and wore cowboy boots in Iowa
to play up his folksy Texas roots rather than his Eastern blueblood
pedigree _ a trick his father never could master. And when he
picked up a baby outside Madden's he rotated to give every camera a
clear shot. Bush said several times during the trip that he felt
energized by the beginning of his quest and, like Clinton, he
appears to enjoy the hand-shaking and baby-kissing that is crucial
in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday at Hadco Industries, a circuit board plant in Derry,
N.H., Bush skipped the tie and donned a blue windbreaker to greet
employees during an early morning shift change. With a half-dozen
microphones bobbing over his head and cameramen frantically
jockeying for position, the governor seemed aware that the
situation _ reminiscent of a scene in the 1970s Robert Redford film
``The Candidate'' _ was a bit ridiculous, and he exchanged knowing
glances with reporters. He appeared to love every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached Boston for a fund-raiser at the Park
Plaza, he was once again wearing jacket and tie. Massachusetts Gov.
Paul Cellucci called it ``the largest ever fundraiser for
Republican in Massachusetts'' netted over $800,000 _ more than
double what was expected.

IMAGE MAY REFLECT A LOSS THIS QUARTER
</HEADLINE>

BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Image Entertainment, scrambling to transform
itself from laserdisc to DVD supplier, announced Tuesday that it
might post a loss in the current quarter due to problems at its new
Las Vegas warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Image made the announcement after the market closed and could
see a sell-off Wednesday. The stock, off 25 cents at $7.50 on
Tuesday, has traded under $4 and over $11 during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Image closed down its warehouse in suburban Chatsworth six weeks
ago when it opened a state-of-the-art, 76,000-square-foot facility
in Las Vegas. The new plant originally was slated to open last year
but software delays held up the opening.
</P>
<P>
   Image said implementing software at the new plant has been
slower than anticipated, leading to shortfalls in meeting orders
and a possible loss in its first quarter ending June 30. It said
the plant will match the efficiency of Chatsworth _ shipping within
48 hours _ in July and reach its goal of shipping in under 24 hours
by August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that when Las Vegas is operating at its planned
level of efficiency, it will allow us to take advantage of the
continued growth I foresee in the DVD market,'' said Martin
Greenwald, president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed Tuesday, Image also reported a
fourth-quarter profit of $1.05 million, or 7 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $10.3 million due to a writedown for
laserdisc assets. Sales rose 45 percent to $23 million.

CAMBY AND SPREWELL STICK TOGETHER AND HELP TRANSFORM KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The second day of training camp passed and Marcus
Camby was spotted standing near the door of the gym while several
teammates slipped by his lanky frame without two words to him.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it was lonely not being Charles Oakley. Camby
understood the emotional connection that the Knicks, the city and
the coach had with the folk hero he replaced last June, but it
wasn't him who made the trade. No one seemed to understand.
</P>
<P>
   But during that same week, there was one teammate who came
along, a free-spirited person who had no ties to Oakley and no
preconceived notions to color his opinion of Camby.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day of camp in walked another outcast, Latrell
Sprewell. If anything, the two had their isolation in common.
</P>
<P>
   Camby arrived as a young, talented player who had been blemished
by his contacts with slippery agents at the University of
Massachusetts and marked as frail after two injury-prone seasons in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was coming off a suspension for choking his former
coach, P.J. Carlesimo, and seemed the symbol of a league gone
horribly awry.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder the two have become inseparable ever since.
Side-by-side in every mall and record store on the road,
side-by-side in a fast-break style that has made everyone's memory
of the Charles Oakley-John Starks era fade just a bit, Sprewell and
Camby have endured a difficult season together.
</P>
<P>
   And together, they are just one series away from winning a title
for a city, a team and a coach that once hesitated to embrace them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into a new situation, it's hard to reach out and find
someone you can hang with on and off the court,'' Camby said
Tuesday, the day before Game 1 of the Knicks' league championship
series against San Antonio. ``You need someone similar to you and a
guy who has been where you've been. And I think Latrell and I both
came into a new city, a new team, a new system and I think we both
confided in each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we sat down we just had a great vibe. We had great talks
and conversation. Here's a guy who had trouble last year, but he
needed someone to relate to, and I think I was that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   They had more than just their pasts to relate, too. Both had to
deal with a sometimes strained relationship with Coach Jeff Van
Gundy and wait patiently for their time to be set free on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   As the season began, Sprewell was a starter, but soon lost that
role when he came back from a stress fracture. Upon his return, he
seemed too selfish to function in the system. At the same time,
Camby was lost in the rotation and can vividly remember the
humiliation of playing only 19 seconds in the Knicks' season opener
in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spree and I used to talk about how things were going to change
for the better,'' Camby said. ``We held to the belief that with
both of us in the game together, we could make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   They were right. By midseason, they became the most adored of
Knicks. No two receive louder applause than Sprewell and Camby. No
two left the Madison Square Garden crowd so breathless as when
Sprewell exploded for menacing dunks and Camby soared through the
air with the sleek lines of a Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   In time, they have transformed the Garden into their cozy home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone has to have a home, eventually,'' assistant
coach Don Chaney said. ``Both of those guys were sort of like
homeless at first. They found themselves in a situation they had to
come to accept. Now, when they come into a game, they change the
whole tempo of things. In their minds, there's that bond anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can say, `We are the key to this team succeeding.' I
think it started off the court with their closeness. They were the
outsiders, but they were the ones to help this team get to where it
is. They are together on and off the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Their ties aren't limited to basketball and their difficult
paths to acceptance. Camby owns a laptop now. Nearly classified as
an egghead with his love of computers, Sprewell has opened Camby's
eyes to a high-tech world beyond a CD player. This is not to say
the two never venture out, but there are a lot of nights when they
kill time on the road by renting an Eddie Murphy movie, surfing the
net and talking about cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk cars all the time,'' Chris Childs said. ``They're
real tight. But I think that it's like when I came here, it takes
time to gradually work your way into the family. With this team, I
think everyone has come to click. But those two, they have the same
character and have gone through the same things with the
expectations people have had of them, so it's good to see them get
along. It's good to see everyone get along.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some strained moments at first. The city, some
pockets of the team, and critics were skeptical of the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely tough for both of us in the beginning,''
Camby said. ``I know for me, just because of who I was traded for,
there was going to be a lot of animosity toward me because of the
deal. You're looking for someone to identify with, and someone you
can talk to. I think we helped each other out a lot in that way.''

N.Y. STATE'S FIRST CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE PICKED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state board selected the first eight charter schools for New
York state Tuesday, setting the stage for a new and hotly disputed
system of taxpayer-financed schools operating outside the regular
public school system. Four of them will be run by profit-making
corporations, and one will be in a school building owned by a
church.
</P>
<P>
   The newly created charter schools, like those in other states
across the country, will receive public money but be freed from the
constraints of local school district rules and union contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But the most radical change for the state and for New York City
is the inclusion of profit-making schools in the first round of
selections. The teachers' union, one of the most effective lobbying
forces in Albany, has fought hard against creating schools outside
of the public system, and is particularly opposed to having
profit-making companies running charter schools. So are most school
superintendents in the state, including Chancellor Rudy Crew in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   The schools chosen Tuesday represent a mix of ethnic and
regional interests, from a Dominican-oriented school in the
Washington Heights section of Manhattan to a Chinese-oriented
school in Flushing, Queens, and a school sponsored by the Urban
League in Albany. Three of the schools will open in the fall, and
the other five in the fall of 2000. Among the first three, two are
profit-making, one in New York City and one in Albany. The third,
also in New York City, will be nonprofit.
</P>
<P>
   The profit-making school in New York City brings together an
unusual coalition of civil rights advocates, community leaders,
church leaders and wealthy Wall Street business executives, who say
they are looking for alternatives to failing public schools in poor
neighborhoods. It will be called the Sisulu Children's Academy,
after Walter Sisulu, the South African freedom fighter, friend of
Nelson Mandela and fellow leader of the African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials attacked the initial round of selections
Tuesday, saying that they had been made in secret and that they
appeared to advance the interests of private companies in taking
over education.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who pushed hard for the charter school
legislation, hailed the first round of schools Tuesday as ``the
single greatest improvement in education in state history.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's staff reviewed the charter school applications, said
Scott Steffey, a vice chancellor at the State University of New
York, which, under the law, has the authority to issue charters for
50 new schools. But Steffey said the governor and his staff played
no role in selecting the schools. Steffey said he supervised the
screening of the applications, which were reviewed by two panels of
charter-school founders, academicians and consultants across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Their recommendations were approved unanimously Tuesday by the
SUNY trustees, meeting in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Sisulu Academy, the profit-making school in New York City,
will be run by Victory Schools Inc., a private management company
set up by Steven Klinsky, a general partner in Forstmann Little &AMP;
Co., the leveraged buyout firm. Another partner, Theodore
Forstmann, made news two months ago when he raised $170 million for
scholarships to send poor children to private schools, attracting a
million applicants nationwide for 40,000 slots.
</P>
<P>
   Sisulu will be in a school building owned by the Canaan Baptist
Church of Christ in Harlem, at 115th Street between St. Nicholas
and Lenox Avenues, but officials said that in accordance with the
charter law, no religious instruction would be given, and that the
church would be only a landlord. Rent, Klinsky said, will be about
$16,000 a month, which he said was market rate.
</P>
<P>
   Klinsky said Tuesday: ``One of the toughest things in the
charter school movement is going to be to find real estate. It's a
beautiful new building, and Harlem is so symbolically important a
place to start.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected to earn a profit by managing the school more
efficiently than other public schools. He and other applicants said
they expected to get $6,000 per pupil in state, federal and local
spending, about $2,000 less than New York City spends on its
students. The typical profit margin for a charter school in other
states is 7 to 15 percent, according to Steffey.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the charter schools are starting with fewer than
250 students, which under the law will make them exempt from
teachers' union contracts, even if they grow in subsequent years,
Steffey said.
</P>
<P>
   The New Covenant Charter School in the Arbor Hill neighborhood
of Albany, which is also scheduled to open this fall, will be
managed by Advantage Schools, a profit-making company that runs
schools in other parts of the country, in conjunction with the
Urban League of Northeastern New York.
</P>
<P>
   The third school to open this fall is the John Reisenbach
Charter School, a nonprofit school to be run by the Learning
Project Inc. It will also be in Harlem, at Lenox Avenue and 126th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The five schools approved Tuesday for the fall of 2000 are
these:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Amber Charter School, a nonprofit to be run in partnership
with the Community Association of Progressive Dominicans in
Washington Heights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flushing International Charter School, a profit-making school
to be run by SABIS Educational Systems Inc., in Flushing, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The Syracuse Charter School, a nonprofit to be run by Margaret
Brooks, a former teacher, in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Victory Children's Academy in Roosevelt, Long Island,
which also will be run by Klinsky's management company.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Harbor Science and Arts Charter School, a nonprofit to be
run by Boys' Harbor in East Harlem.

EDITORIAL: REPUBLICAN MISCHIEF ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, June 16:
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders have already forgotten Speaker Dennis
Hastert's pledge last month to support ``common-sense'' gun
control. Instead of moving to strengthen and expand upon the
handful of gun control initiatives heading for votes on the House
floor this week, GOP leaders have worked out a scheme to make it
easier for lawmakers who take their cue from the National Rifle
Association to vote against meaningful reform.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the House was to consider a single juvenile-justice
bill with gun control amendments attached _ the course followed by
the Senate. Now the Republican leadership has decided to present
two bills. One is expected to include a range of harsh juvenile
crime provisions, as well as a plainly unconstitutional crackdown
on the dissemination of violent material by the media, sponsored by
Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde. The other will contain the
gun control provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The motive here was not to give the juvenile-crime bill the kind
of reasoned debate it needs. Among other things, the final bill is
likely to permit the incarceration of 13-year-old children in adult
prisons. Rather, the idea was to make it possible for lawmakers to
vote against strong gun controls in one bill and for juvenile-crime
measures in another bill. That would allow them to please the NRA
and still portray themselves as right-minded foes of juvenile crime
and media violence.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hyde seemed embarrassed this week about the media-violence
measure, which renders illegal the exhibition, sale or loan of
``sexual or violent materials'' to minors. Its language is so
broadly written that it might criminalize news broadcasts about the
situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are asking Congress to take meaningful steps against
gun violence, not to impose curbs on free speech. House Republicans
may have forgotten their promise, but voters should not forget what
the House does this week.

$20.4 MILLION GRANT WILL HELP LAID-OFF BOEING WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Labor Department is sending up to $20.4 million to
Washington state to help the growing number of laid-off Boeing
workers develop skills to land new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency announced a 26-month grant on Tuesday
designed to help thousands of Boeing employees grappling with the
latest round of layoffs at the aerospace giant. Now, former
machinists, engineers and other workers will be able to tap a wider
range of employment services, ranging from help in drafting resumes
to training in new professions.
</P>
<P>
   The award comes at a critical time for Boeing's workers. The
company has already announced plans to eliminate roughly 24,000
jobs in Washington state by the end of 2000, as part of a broader
initiative to make the company leaner and more profitable. Unlike
past layoffs, however, not all the laid-off workers will be rehired
when business picks up, according to the International Association
of Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This grant is needed because aerospace machinists have skills
that are unique to airplane production,'' said Bill Johnson,
president of IAM Lodge 752, which represents more than 40,000
machinists.
</P>
<P>
   Under the grant, the state's Employment Security Department will
funnel the money to a network of private councils and consortiums.
The groups will then offer employment aid directly to both union
and non-union workers from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of public officials, including President Clinton
and Washington Gov. Gary Locke, hailed the development as a
necessary step to help U.S. firms and their workers cope with the
demands of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of an overall healthy economy, many companies are
having to reorganize and downsize to remain competitive,'' Clinton
said in a statement released in Washington, D.C., Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the grant will target the 2,400 Boeing employees
slated to be let go by the end of December, according to the Labor
Department. However, state officials have yet to receive details on
the scope of the award. And they say the federal agency may also
award additional funds to cover the rest of the workers Boeing says
it will lay off in the region by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often in these cases with large layoffs the Department of
Labor will accept additional requests to provide additional funding
later on,'' said Michael Wilson, a spokesman for the Employment
Security Department.
</P>
<P>
   To kick off the effort, the Labor Department is making $10
million immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance will come on top of career centers that Boeing
has already established to assist former employees struggling to
shift from the aerospace industry to other fields.
</P>
<P>
   The award also arrives only two months before Boeing enters
direct talks on a new contract for its 46,000 machinists. A key
negotiating point will be how the manufacturer will manage its work
force during the next four years. In the past, Boeing and its
unions have battled over the company's efforts to hire outside
contractors because the move threatened union jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the Labor Department announced a
separate $4 million grant that will assist 375 laid-off workers at
Packard Bell/NEC in Fife, Intel Corp. in DuPont and Matsushita
Semiconductor in Puyallup, all in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, Boeing workers can contact
www.reachingout-washington.com for other information on employment
services.

 &HT;    Slide ends for Braves, Glavine
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ You had to know it wasn't going to come the easy way.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves finally worked their way out of the season-long
four-game losing streak with a 4-3 win over the NL Central-leading
Astros on a ninth-inning bloop hit by Brian Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez lead off the inning with an infield hit. Pinch
running for him, Otis Nixon then stole second by sneaking a hand
into the base just ahead of a Ricky Gutierrez tag. After watching
6-foot-7 Houston reliever Scott Elarton strike out Ryan Klesko and
Andruw Jones back-to-back, Hunter worked a first pitch into center
field for a single.
</P>
<P>
   Using a season-high eight strikeouts, Tom Glavine pitched truer
to form on Tuesday night and got his first win since May 19 to show
for it. He had to fight his way through the last four innings but
was rewarded. The 4-7 Glavine had gone four starts without a win.
</P>
<P>
   He gets little sympathy from Houston's fifth starter Chris Holt.
Holt, who missed all of last season after rotator cuff surgery, was
seeking his first win since Aug. 21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, faced with a barrage of questions this season and a
barrage of runs in the previous two games, finally came up with an
answer against Holt on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the Astros jump on Glavine with three runs on
three hits in the fourth, the Braves came ripping back with three
consecutive hits of their own to even the game 3-3 in the top of
the fifth inning. A two-run homer by Andruw Jones cut the lead to
3-2. A Randall Simon double and a two-out error by Craig Biggio
allowed the Braves to even the score as Simon took off from second
on Keith Lockhart's ground ball and slid in safely ahead of
Biggio's recovery throw home.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine had gone four starts without a win and collected
only three in the first third of the season, after a 20-win Cy
Young award-winning season last year.
</P>
<P>
   He gets little sympathy from Houston's fifth starter Chris Holt.
Holt, who missed all last season after rotator cuff surgery, was
seeking his first win since Aug. 21, 1997. He's lost all six of his
decisions this season and had taken back-to-back no-decisions
despite leaving with leads in each of his last two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Through six innings it was a draw.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, faced with a barrage of questions this season and a
barrage of runs in the previous two games, finally came up with an
answer on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the Astros jump on Glavine with three runs on
three hits in the fourth, the Braves came ripping back with three
consecutive hits of their own to even the game 3-3 in the top of
the fifth inning. A two-run homer by Andruw Jones cut the lead to
3-2. A Randall Simon double and a two-out error by Craig Biggio
allowed the Braves to even the score as Simon took off from second
on Keith Lockhart's ground ball and slid in safely ahead of
Biggio's recovery throw home, which Tony Eusebio failed to catch
cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves made it out of the first inning without a deficit to
deal with for the first time since Friday night's game against the
Devil Rays. Glavine made it through the order the initial time
without allowing a run for the first time in three starts.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jeff Bagwell got busy. He pumped a homer to left field, his
second in as many nights, to start a three-run fourth inning, which
featured a Richard Hidalgo double off the center-field wall and a
Carl Everett sacrifice fly.

TWA AND UNION NOW AWAIT MEMBERS' VOTE ON NEW PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ TWA and Machinists union officials are
endorsing new contract proposals for 16,000 of the carrier's
employees, but the decision will rest with union members.
</P>
<P>
   The union Tuesday confirmed that, under terms of the tentative
18-month agreement, the employees would receive an 8.5 percent
raise on Aug. 1 and a 3 percent raise in August 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines also would increase benefits and pension
fund contributions, according to Glenn Sanders, secretary-treasurer
of Machinists Local 1650.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing to jump up and down about,'' Sanders said. ``In
my opinion, it's a little better than what was previously offered.
But the members will have the final say.''
</P>
<P>
   In voting last week, TWA workers appeared to be rejecting a
contract that the company said would bring wages to 90 percent of
the industry standard by July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal, tentatively agreed to Sunday, would expire in
January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said TWA employees he has talked to were mixed in their
reactions to the latest proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're split right now,'' he said. ``But we don't
have all the details yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said the local hoped Friday to distribute copies of the
proposal to the area's 2,300 TWA mechanics. A meeting to discuss
and vote on the proposal is expected next week, tentatively
scheduled for the Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will give everybody about four or five days to study the
contract and make their decision,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the mechanics and ramp workers, the Machinists
union represents TWA's flight attendants and customer-service
employees. If one of those groups rejects its contract proposals,
the agreement does not take effect.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said one advantage of the proposal was that it expires
in January 2001. That would allow the union to re-evaluate industry
standards before negotiating a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   After accepting concessionary contracts to keep TWA afloat
throughout the 1990s, the union had demanded that TWA wages be
brought up to industry standard in the next contract.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum hourly pay for TWA mechanics now is $17.93. Under
the tentative agreement, that would rise to $20.03 in August 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal does not account for TWA employees working
under terms of a previous contract since September 1997, when the
pact was to have expired. That means no back pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is retroactive, and that's a disadvantage,'' Sanders
said.
</P>
<P>
   The union also agreed to some use of regional jets by TWA's
commuter partners, a provision that aviation experts said TWA
needed to compete with other major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said TWA and union officials had found a
workable compromise for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This essentially buys TWA more time,'' said Linda Bannister,
airline analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis. ``This gives TWA 18
months to get its house in order, from a financial standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   It also gives the union time to assess William F. Compton, the
company's new chief executive officer, said David Levine,
contributing editor of PlaneBusiness, an industry financial
newsletter. Compton last month succeeded TWA Chairman Gerald
Gitner, who was much maligned by the union for his downsizing
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Compton continue shrinking the airline, or will TWA start
growing again?'' Levine said. ``The employees will find out whether
Compton truly is interested in improving relations between himself
and the unions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Levine also sees problems with the tentative agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside obviously is that it will put TWA back into the
negotiating cycle very quickly,'' he said. ``Talks could start
again as early as spring.''

H&AMP;R BLOCK'S OLD AND NEW UNITS DO WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ H&AMP;R Block Inc. on Tuesday reported a
larger-than-predicted 29 percent increase in profit from its
continuing tax and financial services operations.
</P>
<P>
   Complex new tax rules brought more customers to Block's
traditional tax preparation centers last filing season, producing
20 percent growth for the company in what is generally called a
mature industry.
</P>
<P>
   But market analysts following the stock say they also were
impressed by a near doubling of Block's much newer mortgage lending
business, as well as its other expansion efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Block's newest business services unit, which is composed of
regional accounting firms the company began buying 13 months ago,
turned a $7.1 million profit for the year.
</P>
<P>
   And when Block reported its earnings Tuesday, the company also
announced that its Ohio, Arizona and Indiana tests of new expanded
Block Financial Centers during the recent filing season went so
well that 70 new centers will be opened by the end of December. The
precise locations are still being picked, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Block has its plate full, but I think the outlook is
quite positive,'' said Pete Heckmann, a research analyst at George
K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Block reported that its profit from continuing operations rose
to $237.8 million, or $2.36 a share, during the year ending April
30, from $183.8 million, or $1.71 a share, the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Kansas City financial services company's total
profit for fiscal 1999 dropped from year-earlier levels, to $215.4
million, or $2.14 a share, from $392.1 million, or $3.65 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Final profit was lower because of one-time losses on credit card
operations that Block sold in January and a much larger one-time
profit the company made on its sale of CompuServe Corp. in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose to $1.64 billion from $1.27 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Block's core tax services and its newer mortgage lending
operations were the biggest contributors to the higher
continuing-operations profit, said Frank L. Salizonni, the
company's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Higher revenue, lower bad debt expenses in the company's refund
anticipation loan program and improved tax software sales all
improved tax service profits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the largest share of profit and revenue occurred
during Block's fourth quarter, which spans the peak filing season
for U.S. taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Block had earnings of $297.3 million, or $3.05 a share, on
revenue of $1.2 billion during the latest fourth quarter, up from
$256.9 million, or $2.43 a share, on revenue of $967.6 million a
year earlier.

 &HT;    Man lives his dream at Cinergy Field
 &HT;    By Sam Borden
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The words are in shaky print, with mostly capital
letters, as though the author's hand could not keep up with his
flowing thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is from the memory of a soon-to-be 78-year old,'' the
note read, ``and I could go on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   But he won't.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer has ravaged Dewitt Sparks' lungs, draining the life out
of his body with each passing hour. But while the malignant tumor
has left the long-time Dayton resident's body in a battered,
withered state, his eyes _ and his dreams _ remain immune.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks had written down some of the things he wanted to say to
two of his heroes, Cincinnati Reds radio announcers Marty Brennaman
and Joe Nuxhall, and Tuesday night he was able to pass the message
on as he spent two innings in the broadcast booth at Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with baseball and listening to the Reds,'' Sparks
whispered, his voice barely audible above the din of the crowd.
``I've been here many times but this is something that I've always
wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of The Angel Foundation, which arranged for the
visit during the fourth and fifth innings of the game with the New
York Mets, Sparks' wish came true.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as though an angel was watching, too, as a foul ball
from the Mets' John Olerud found its way into the press box while
Sparks looked on. Gripping the ball in hands that have tuned his
radio dial to listen to the Reds for decades, Sparks talked with
Nuxhall about ``the good old days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about the old ballparks and where he used to play,''
Nuxhall said. ``His spirits are great _ if we can make someone feel
good for a day, or week, or anything, it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unknown how many days and weeks Sparks has left, but the
1939 Roosevelt High School graduate began his life with baseball,
playing catcher in Little League because, he says, ``that's where
the action was.''
</P>
<P>
   Clutching faded black-and-white pictures of rare Indian Chief
motorcycles and talking about the airplanes he flew without a
license, it became clear that Sparks holds his past tightly against
his present. For about 30 minutes Tuesday, they were one and the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Joe started pitching about the same time I started
working for NCR, so I've followed him for a long time,'' Sparks
said. ``I've always admired the guy. Tonight is a dream come true
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   A dream that may have come just in time for Sparks, who is
forced to spend most of his time in a wheelchair. As he and
Brennaman chatted about radio announcers, a photographer moved in
and asked Sparks if he would give the Reds play-by-play man a big
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, most of the time it hurts to smile,'' Sparks
choked out, his blue eyes suddenly shining brightly.
</P>
<P>
   But then he flashed a toothy grin, like a man who had been
filled with joy.
</P>
<P>
   Or, like someone who had been touched by an angel.

PRINCIPAL'S 6-YEAR LEGAL BATTLE NEARS END 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The six-year legal battle that put a Westchester County
elementary school principal in legal limbo and led to legal bills
of nearly $1 million, and whose almost Dickensian bureaucratic
inertia embarrassed the school district that brought the case, has
reached a tentative conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Kuntz, the lawyer for the Hendrick Hudson Central School
District, said in an interview Tuesday night that the district and
Joanne Falinski, the principal that the district tried to
discipline in 1993, had settled out of court. He declined to give
details, including whether Dr. Falinski would be reinstated or
would receive money in a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a draft statement, Kuntz said, ``Both sides have
agreed to resolve these matters in order to avoid the expense and
length of time necessarily involved in pursuing legal procedures to
their conclusion.'' The settlement, he said, also includes Dr.
Falinski's federal lawsuit against the district charging that
rights to free speech were abridged.
</P>
<P>
   Kuntz said that the agreement would not be legally binding until
Tuesday and that he could not comment on it. Robert Saperstein, Dr.
Falinski's attorney, declined comment. Dr. Falinski's telephone
number is not listed.
</P>
<P>
   Stacie Cignarale, president of the school board, declined to
discuss the settlement, but said, ``The community wants this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falinski case has lasted so long that all 325 children at
the Furnace Woods School in Cortlandt when she was the principal
have since graduated. Now 46, Dr. Falinski, once one of the
youngest principals in the state, has been preparing schedules and
doing other clerical work while collecting her $100,000 annual
salary. In six years, the district has held 64 days of hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent who suspended her has retired and the
principal who replaced her has herself been replaced. And there is
a largely new school board and president.
</P>
<P>
   The act under which she was accused, known as 3020a, was
intended to oust criminal or incompetent teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The worst misconduct charge involved telling a child's parents
that unless the boy was taken off the drug Ritalin, the school
would not provide counseling.

$20.4 MILLION GRANT WILL HELP LAID-OFF BOEING WORKERS  
 CORRECTS IAM LODGE NO. TO 751 FROM 752, IN 4TH GRAPH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Labor Department is sending up to $20.4 million to
Washington state to help the growing number of laid-off Boeing
workers develop skills to land new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency announced a 26-month grant on Tuesday
designed to help thousands of Boeing employees grappling with the
latest round of layoffs at the aerospace giant. Now, former
machinists, engineers and other workers will be able to tap a wider
range of employment services, ranging from help in drafting resumes
to training in new professions.
</P>
<P>
   The award comes at a critical time for Boeing's workers. The
company has already announced plans to eliminate roughly 24,000
jobs in Washington state by the end of 2000, as part of a broader
initiative to make the company leaner and more profitable. Unlike
past layoffs, however, not all the laid-off workers will be rehired
when business picks up, according to the International Association
of Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This grant is needed because aerospace machinists have skills
that are unique to airplane production,'' said Bill Johnson,
president of IAM Lodge 751, which represents more than 40,000
machinists.
</P>
<P>
   Under the grant, the state's Employment Security Department will
funnel the money to a network of private councils and consortiums.
The groups will then offer employment aid directly to both union
and non-union workers from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of public officials, including President Clinton
and Washington Gov. Gary Locke, hailed the development as a
necessary step to help U.S. firms and their workers cope with the
demands of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of an overall healthy economy, many companies are
having to reorganize and downsize to remain competitive,'' Clinton
said in a statement released in Washington, D.C., Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the grant will target the 2,400 Boeing employees
slated to be let go by the end of December, according to the Labor
Department. However, state officials have yet to receive details on
the scope of the award. And they say the federal agency may also
award additional funds to cover the rest of the workers Boeing says
it will lay off in the region by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often in these cases with large layoffs the Department of
Labor will accept additional requests to provide additional funding
later on,'' said Michael Wilson, a spokesman for the Employment
Security Department.
</P>
<P>
   To kick off the effort, the Labor Department is making $10
million immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance will come on top of career centers that Boeing
has already established to assist former employees struggling to
shift from the aerospace industry to other fields.
</P>
<P>
   The award also arrives only two months before Boeing enters
direct talks on a new contract for its 46,000 machinists. A key
negotiating point will be how the manufacturer will manage its work
force during the next four years. In the past, Boeing and its
unions have battled over the company's efforts to hire outside
contractors because the move threatened union jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the Labor Department announced a
separate $4 million grant that will assist 375 laid-off workers at
Packard Bell NEC in Fife, Intel Corp. in DuPont and Matsushita
Semiconductor in Puyallup, all in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, Boeing workers can contact

services.

ACCUSATIONS OF RACIST LEADERSHIP PROMPT N.J. TROOPERS' UNION TO
SPLIT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Two months after Gov. Christie Whitman issued a
report confirming that State Police routinely discriminate against
minority drivers, the force was shaken by two new racial incidents
Tuesday, when both the acting superintendent and the head of the
officers' union came under fire for allegedly making offensive
comments about women, Latinos and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 70 minority and female officers announced that they
are withdrawing from the State Troopers' Fraternal Organization,
saying that the union president routinely referred to them using
racial epithets and crude references to female genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   And Acting Superintendent Michael Fedorko _ who assumed command
when the previous superintendent was fired for making racially
insensitive comments in February _ was forced to defend himself
after a newspaper published transcripts from a police gathering in
1995, in which he made jokes about Latin music and made vulgar
comments suggesting that female troopers lack the bravery to do
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorko said the newspaper had taken his comments out of context
because they were made at the equivalent of a celebrity roast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me that they attacked my leadership,'' Fedorko said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that she would let the attorney general determine
whether Fedorko's statements warranted disciplinary action. But she
said that statements Fedorko made in 1995 _ they were videotaped
and reported in The Record of Hackensack _ were troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't sound like jokes that I would think are
particularly funny,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The flare-ups come at a particularly troubling time for Whitman,
who this spring became the first New Jersey official to acknowledge
that troopers used racial profiling to stop and search minority
drivers illegally. The governor had hoped to put the issue behind
her and was trying to revamp the force before the U.S. Justice
Department civil rights division takes legal action.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor's offer to Col. Andre Parker of the Illinois
State Police to become New Jersey's first black police
superintendent has set off a chain reaction of lobbying, political
posturing and heated words.
</P>
<P>
   Many legislators are pushing the governor to promote from within
the ranks, saying that the appointment of an outsider would damage
morale.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Iskrzycki, president of the troopers union, has also
spoken out against Parker. He was quoted in the Star-Ledger of
Newark this week as saying that ``I'd rather have them choose Al
Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   Iskrzycki's comments so infuriated minority troopers that they
decided to withdraw from the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing Colonel Parker has in common with Al Sharpton
is that he's a black man who the union officials obviously don't
like,'' said Phil Moran, a lawyer who is helping minority troopers
form their own fraternal organization.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said Iskrzycki has for years ``referred to people using
racial slurs, sexist comments and has utterly failed to represent
anyone other than white troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   Iskrzycki did not return calls requesting comment, but a
spokesman said he was misquoted.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, the only outside candidate on the short list of five
finalists for the superintendent's job, has not accepted the offer.
Whitman administration officials say that Parker thinks it will
take three years to transform the force and is concerned that if
Whitman is elected to the Senate in 2000, his tenure could end in
less than 15 months.

 BOEING LANDS HUGE ORDER FOR 737s AT PARIS SHOW  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ International Lease Finance Corp. has ordered 50 of
Boeing's next generation 737s with options for 50 more, making it
the biggest order ever for the next generation family of airplanes
built in Renton, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   With the options, the value of the order is about $4.5 billion
based on the average list price of the various mix of planes.
</P>
<P>
   But International Lease reportedly received steep discounts from
Boeing, so much so that some analysts said Boeing may still be
going for market share over archrival Airbus Industrie rather than
trying to improve its minuscule commercial profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not true,'' Alan Mulally, president of the
Commercial Airplanes group, said in an interview following the
order announcement Tuesday at the Paris Air Show.
</P>
<P>
   He said the deal was good business, for Boeing and International
Lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of this deal,'' Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said its goal is to increase profit margins on its
commercial airplanes to 10 percent, and Mulally said the
transaction with International Lease was ``supportive of Boeing's
approach toward making a reasonable financial return ... this is
absolutely supportive of moving in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   At an earlier news conference for the order announcement, Steven
Udvar-Hazy, president and chief executive of International Lease,
was asked about the discount his leasing company received for the
737-700s, 737-800s and 737-900s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only say we did not pay retail price,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said negotiations took six months, and he described them as
``hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A transaction of this size is very complex,'' he said, adding
that he believes the final result was a ``win-win'' situation for
Boeing and International Lease.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is under a lot of pressure to improve its commercial
financial performance, and top executives have vowed they will
sacrifice market share for profitability, even if it means losing
an order on price to Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   But Byron Callan, aerospace analyst for Merrill Lynch who is in
Paris for the air show, said if the discounts are as steep as he
has heard, then he would begin to question Boeing's commitment to
better jetliner margins.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delivered a record 563 commercial jetliners last year,
but made no profit on those planes. Mulally, in the interview, said
Boeing has not changed its previous projection that commercial
margins this year and next will be 2 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nisbet, an industry analyst with JSA Research, did a recent
analysis that concluded Boeing last year sold its planes below the
cost of producing them, with average prices paid by customers 14
percent to 27 percent below list prices.
</P>
<P>
   Nisbet did his analysis to quantify Boeing's practice of
discounting its jetliners to customers in its price war with
Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Tuesday, Nisbet said he does not know
how much discount Boeing gave International Lease on the 50 firm
orders.
</P>
<P>
   But the discount was likely steep, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a foregone conclusion that these huge orders from
leasing companies are full of deep discounts because they mean so
much to Boeing and Airbus in terms of market share,'' Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   One factor to consider in trying to understand if the deal is
good for Boeing is the delivery date of the planes ordered, he
said. If the deliveries mean Boeing can keep production rates high,
then the cost of each plane is less. ``In that case, Boeing could
offer some discounts without hurting its earnings,'' Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Boeing probably went beyond `some' with an order of that
size,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus also announced a billion-dollar order Tuesday by
Singapore Aircraft Leasing Enterprise for 20 A320s and three A321s.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus announcement,though, was overshadowed by the
International Lease order for Boeing planes.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Udvar-Hazy said the first delivery in the
new orders will come in early 2001, and if the additional 50
airplanes are confirmed, deliveries would continue until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   He called the next generation 737 a ``cornerstone of our
portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest order brings to 360 the number of 737s that
International Leasing owns, including planes that have not yet been
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Tuesday, Boeing received orders from Korean Air Lines
Co. for two 747-400 freighters. The airline said it would replace
two Airbus A300 freighters when it accepts delivery of the new
plans, currently set or May and June of next year.

PAYLESS CASHWAYS EARNS $2.8 MILLION IN QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Payless Cashways Inc. continues to improve
its bottom line, reporting Tuesday that it earned $2.8 million in
the second quarter, helped by some one-time items.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding those extraordinary items _ ranging from a gain of
$5.6 million as a result of freezing its pension plan to a charge
of $2.8 million related to store closings _ Payless earned $1.6
million, compared with the $732,000 for the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the quarter, which ended May 29, were $492.7 million,
an increase of 1.6 percent based on same-store sales, or sales at
stores open at least one year.
</P>
<P>
   The home improvement and building supply retailer, based in
Kansas City, also said it was opening a store in Tempe, Ariz., and
closing five stores elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The stores being closed, which will mean a loss of about 250
full- and part-time jobs, will comprise one in Cincinnati, three in
Minneapolis and the only Payless-owned store in Bloomington, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Payless said it hoped to place many of those employees affected
by the Minneapolis and Cincinnati closings in other stores in those
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Payless is opening what it describes as an ``express
store'' in Tempe in September. That 35,000-square-foot store will
be largely focused on a professional contractor selection of paint,
tools, plumbing and electrical supplies, housewares and seasonal
products. It will not have a lumberyard.
</P>
<P>
   The Tempe store will be the first new store for Payless since
1997 and will open just over two years after the company filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in July 1997. The company was
forced to take the action after strangling on more than $600
million in long-term debt, left over from an ill-fated
management-led buyout in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it was scouting locations to open more
stores _ traditional and express _ and expected to make more
store-opening announcements before the end of the year. Payless has
154 stores in 18 states.
</P>
<P>
   As for converting existing stores to its new contractor-friendly
prototype, Payless said it expected most of its stores to be
switched over within three years. Four stores, including the one in
Lenexa, already have been converted, and two more, including one in
Kansas City, North, are undergoing similar changes.
</P>
<P>
   The new store format is ``designed around and focused on the
professional customer,'' said the company's chief executive
officer, Millard Barron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early returns from the initial two locations that have been
converted are encouraging, and customer response has been extremely
favorable,'' Barron said.
</P>
<P>
   Payless officials declined to reveal same-store sales trends at
those early conversions.
</P>
<P>
   But same-store sales figures overall for the second quarter
suggest that Payless' focus on the professional customer is paying
off, with such sales to that segment up 13 percent in the second
quarter, about the same as in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Same-store sales to do-it-yourselfers, however, continue to be
disappointing, declining 8 percent in the second quarter on top of
a 7.9 percent drop in the first quarter.

EDITORIAL: POLITICIZING THE CITY CHARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 16:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's plan to revise New York City's Charter
is a political power play and a terrible civics lesson. The mayor
announced a new Charter Revision Commission on Tuesday that he
hopes will consider what happens if he leaves office early. Under
the current Charter, Public Advocate Mark Green would become the
mayor, and Giuliani clearly does not want one of his most vocal
critics to take over if he is elected to the U.S. Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   As the Charter now reads, if the mayor leaves for Washington in
January 2001 Green would take charge for almost a year before the
next mayoral election, in November 2001. From this City Hall perch,
Green would have much higher visibility in the next contest for
mayor against other possible contenders, including Council Speaker
Peter Vallone, Comptroller Alan Hevesi and Bronx Borough President
Fernando Ferrer. The new commission is expected to consider
changing the system so that if the public advocate or perhaps even
the comptroller takes over from the mayor, there would be another
city election in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   As succession mechanisms go, a quick special election can be a
valid way to fill a vacancy. But this effort to change the rules in
the middle of the game will open the door to all sorts of mischief.
However satisfying to the mayor in the short term, there are
long-term hazards to tampering with the city's fundamental
structure. Once convened, this commission can be expected to
address some of the city's most controversial issues _ including
term limits for politicians, land use planning, nonpartisan
elections and the budget process. The commission, headed by the
mayor's friend and former deputy, Randy Mastro, is loaded with
Giuliani supporters. There is little time to produce thoughtful and
well-aired recommendations for the ballot this November. Because
this off-year election involves only a few scattered city races,
voter turnout should be about a third of the turnout in regular
elections. The mayor says that New York voters could then focus on
revising the charter without other electoral distractions. More
likely, voters would simply forget to go to the polls. This is no
way to change the basic structure of New York City government.

FLOYD RATLIFF IS DEAD AT 80; LINKED VISUAL ARTS TO SCIENCE
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: N.M., Colo.)  (nk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Floyd Ratliff, a physiological psychologist and biophysicist
who explored the depths of consciousness and perception, died on
Sunday in Santa Fe, N.M., where he moved after retiring from
Rockefeller University in New York. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff combined expertise in his specialties with a keen
interest in the history and philosophy of science. One focal point
was the thought of Ernst Mach, the Austrian physicist, psychologist
and philosopher of science (1838-1916), who was a leader of modern
positivism.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff, who taught at Rockefeller for 31 years and became a
professor emeritus in 1989, also studied the relations binding the
visual arts and visual sciences as witnessed in 19th-century
science, Neo-Impressionism and the contrast and contour effects of
art of the Sung Dynasty. With this in mind, he examined the neural
mechanisms of vision, especially how the retina analyzes and
reduces the apparent chaos of incoming data.
</P>
<P>
   His laboratory explored molecular events elicited by a single
particle of light within a single nerve cell. The findings have
been used to diagnose visual and other neurological disorders.
</P>
<P>
   His retinal studies led to investigations of the scientific
basis for subjective visual phenomena _ like the ``optical
illusions'' in contrasts of color and brightness _ that have served
to inspire artists. It was Mach who first mathematically formulated
the psychophysiological bases of such contrast effects.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff wrote extensively in his field and published the
textbook ``Mach Bands: Quantitative Studies of Neural Networks in
the Retina'' (Holden-Day, 1965) as well as ``Paul Signac and Color
in Neo-Impressionism'' (Rockefeller University, 1992).
</P>
<P>
   Signac, in association with Georges Seurat, developed the
divisionist school, also known as Pointillism, in which the painter
employed small dabs of color for the eye of the viewer to blend for
intense color effects.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Ratliff was born in La Junta, Colo., and served in World
War II. He graduated from Colorado College in 1947, and went to
Brown University for an M.A., followed by a Ph.D. in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected a member of the National Academy of Science and
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. For most of the 1980s he
was president of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation.
</P>
<P>

NEW INSIGHTS ON TREATING IMMIGRANTS FOR DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, Mohammed Arif denied he had a drinking
problem. He saw himself as an immigrant success story: He had
mastered a new language, earned enough to support relatives back in
his native Pakistan, and fit right in when his fellow construction
workers hit the bars at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about drinking was this false pride,'' Arif said,
recalling the dark years when he failed to see how alcohol was
corroding his new life. ``There was all this finger-pointing in my
family, and it would get me so mad. Why is everyone telling me I've
got a drinking problem when it's me who's taking care of
everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   He eventually sought help, ricocheting from one detoxification
program to another. It was not until he landed at Nav Nirmaan, the
only New York City substance-abuse treatment program run by and for
immigrants from Southeast Asia, that he pulled himself and his
family together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a big difference,'' said Arif, who now tells his story
as a means of counseling other immigrants at the center, which is
in Elmhurst, Queens. ``When you're with people from your own
background, your own culture, it's like there's no more curtain in
front of your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nav Nirmaan, which means ``new beginning'' in the Gujrathi
language of western India, is at the vanguard of a growing trend in
drug and alcohol treatment programs that not only provide
counseling in the native language of immigrants, but also consider
their cultural background and the traumas of the immigrant
experience itself.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants arrive with specific cultural attitudes and family
dynamics that influence how they respond to treatment. In a Russian
family, for example, a teen-ager on drugs often listens more to a
grandparent's guidance than a parent's. An Asian man arrested for
drunken driving is more likely to let down his defenses and talk
with a female therapist. And the therapy offered in mainstream drug
abuse and alcoholism programs, counselors say, does not work for
immigrants who fear or distrust authority figures, feel deep shame
at revealing family problems to strangers, and do not relate to
their self-help jargon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigration and acculturation stress are very pronounced in
immigrants,'' said Luis Zayas, a psychologist and professor of
social work at Fordham University who has studied drinking patterns
in Latin American immigrants. ``But it's only recently that we have
culturally adjusted treatment, as more clinicians become attuned to
the impact of immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   Spanish-language social service groups proliferated in the
mid-1980s, and there are now many substance-abuse centers with
Spanish-speaking professional staff members. But there have been
far fewer services adapted to the non-Hispanic immigrants who have
poured into the New York City area in the last decade, bringing
with them their own cultural idiosyncrasies.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy has now
recognized that an antidrug message aimed at American-born parents
and their children may not make sense to immigrant families who do
not even recognize drug slang.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next month, its new $185 million youth campaign will
feature material in 11 languages tailored to Hispanic, Vietnamese,
Korean and other cultures. ``The issue is not that they have
greater drug use _ many of these groups have drug rates that are
lower than whites,'' said Alan Levitt, the manager of the antidrug
campaign. ``It's just that for some of these audiences
_first-generation immigrants, for example _ there is a whole
different kind of information you have to supply.''
</P>
<P>
   That immigration is stressful, now and in the past, is obvious.
For people who do not speak English, it means first and foremost
the inability to communicate. Often, especially for those from the
former Soviet Union and some Asians, it means a substantial loss of
economic and social standing.
</P>
<P>
   Female immigrants usually find work faster than the men,
straining traditional family roles, because they are more willing
to take low-status jobs. Children adjust to the new culture and
learn English before their parents, giving them more independence
and more adult-like responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In short, psychologists say, what many people experience when
they come to the United States is a tremendous sense of loss. Some
immigrants try to cope by turning to drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, we hear the phrase `I'm nobody here,' '' said Helen
Kagen, a social worker who runs a substance abuse program for
Russian-speaking immigrants at the Educational Alliance in
Manhattan. ``People find themselves in a situation where they are
not capable of doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the pressures are particularly debilitating to
immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who are products of a
culture that embraced drinking and a totalitarian system that
undermined individuality.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors who deal with Russian-speaking immigrants said they
were also seeing serious drug use in youngsters, who experience
both the exhilarating freedom and the burdens typical of immigrant
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are under stress, even more than the adults,'' said
Anna Snol, who counsels teen-agers in Brooklyn with her husband,
Arkadiy, a former doctor in a Soviet prison camp for drug users.
``They come here and everything is possible: sex freedom, work
freedom, school freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They learn English and they know more than their parents. They
begin to feel themselves heroes. They say to themselves, I see
everybody smoking marijuana. Why not me?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Problems arise when old habits combine with immigration stress,
boredom and lack of knowledge about local laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drinking is so deeply rooted in the culture, especially with
male identity,'' said Mina Chang, the director of the Asian
American Mental Health Institute in Queens, who has created an
alcohol treatment program for Korean immigrants. ``The more you
drink, the more you show you can control yourself and the more you
are male.''
</P>
<P>
   For immigrants, as for anyone else, one family member's drinking
problem can spawn other problems, like spouse and child abuse, and
that is the behavior that often brings them forcibly into
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our cultural makeup, the cry for help is the last stage,''
said Roy Tellis, the Indian-born executive director of Nav Nirmaan.
``There's a lot of shame involved, and there's the isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical Nav Nirmaan client, he said, is a man who lives in a
cultural cocoon. He drinks as a form of socializing with other men
from his home region, reads newspapers and watches television shows
in his native language, and feels confusion and rage when his wife
and Americanized children try to venture outside the tight circle
of Southeast Asian culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a male-dominated patriarchal society,'' Tellis said.
``And the father says: I work hard, I put food on the table. So
what if I take a few drinks?''
</P>
<P>
   An approach like that used in Alcoholics Anonymous, counselors
said, rarely works with immigrants. People from the former Soviet
Union, for example, often distrust not only their peers, but also
people with authority. ``We are talking about an enormous level of
resistance to outside persuasion, because all the messages, all the
lies, in the totalitarian society were delivered by authority
figures,'' said Dr. Kagen of the Educational Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   And it is particularly difficult for those who lived in the
Soviet system to admit they are alcoholics, a term that was
reserved for those in the physically incapacitated late stages of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, there is a difference between a drinker and an
alcoholic,'' said Michael, one of Dr. Kagen's clients who spoke
only on the condition that his last name not be published. ``The
drinker can stop. The alcoholic can't. So if you ask for help, it
is admitting you're an alcoholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael, 63, a former professor in Moscow, started drinking
heavily after he lost his first job in New York City and became
homeless. ``When you sleep on a bench,'' he said, ``it's not so bad
when you drink, but it's impossible when you're sober.''
</P>
<P>
   He was sent to shelters, to hospitals and to detoxification
programs. ``They were nice and very professional,'' he said, ``but
all their experiences connect with American realities. Here I don't
have to explain a lot of things. They understand already.''

PATAKI LOWERS BAR FOR GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki and Republican leaders are
making it somewhat easier to obtain a spot on the ballot in the
Republican presidential primary in New York, responding to
criticism that the party was trying to control these contests with
arduous requirements that were a throwback to old-style machine
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki announced Tuesday that candidates who wanted to enter the
Republican primary next year would have to gather fewer signatures
than required in the 1996 primary, which was marked by accusations
that the state party used the rules to insure that only the
leadership's favorite, former Sen. Bob Dole, was on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements have historically been more restrictive than in
any other state. They were considered so onerous in 1996 that
besides Dole, only two Republicans, Steve Forbes and Patrick
Buchanan, sought to take part in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spent more than $1 million for workers to round up
signatures and for lawyers to fend off challenges to his petitions
by the party leadership, ultimately getting on the ballot across
the state. Buchanan was listed in most parts of the state. Dole
ended up winning the primary, and the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, candidates in the Republican primary had to collect
signatures in all 31 congressional districts in the state. The
number per district was 5 percent of registered party voters or
1,250 signatures, whichever number was smaller. The new rules still
require signatures from all 31 districts, but the number required
has been reduced, to one-half of 1 percent of registered party
voters, or 1,000, whichever figure is smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki hailed the changes, which bring the requirements for the
Republican primary in line with the less stringent ones for the
Democratic primary. By tradition, the leaders of the two major
parties decide on the primary requirements every four years and
then present them to the governor and the state Legislature, which
ratify them.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules ``will help insure that New York Republicans have
a choice of candidates,'' the governor said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign of Forbes, who is running again, dismissed the
changes as inadequate. Campaign manager Bill Dal Col said that even
with the reduction in the number of signatures, it was still more
difficult to get on the ballot in New York than in any other state.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that in most states with petition requirements, the
campaigns need gather only a total number of signatures statewide,
rather than a certain number per district. And in some states, the
secretaries of state have the power to put candidates on the
primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they truly wanted to open up the election process in New
York state, they would streamline it significantly,'' Dal Col said.
``This still leaves the party apparatus in control, rather than the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Forbes campaign planned to spend $500,000 to
win a spot in the New York primary, which is to be held on March 7,
2000.

ITALY DOWNPLAYS GIANT TASK AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Of the four teams scheduled to play at the Rose
Bowl in their first games of the 1999 Women's World Cup on Sunday,
Italy was the last to arrive in Los Angeles, getting into town
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't take long for the Italians to begin some serious
work.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m. Tuesday, the Azzurriu hit the practice pitch at
Loyola Marymount for the first of two sessions. Italy also
practiced from 4-6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The double duty schedule is the same for the next four days
leading up to Sunday's match against Germany, which the Italians
enter as a decided underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a few problems physically this morning because of
the time change and the travel,'' Italy coach Carlo Facchin said
through an interpreter. ``But we were prepared for this.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Italians also continue preparing for are the three
grueling first-round matches awaiting them in the so-called Group
of Death, which also includes Brazil, Mexico and the aforementioned
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   But that seems to be the least of Facchin's worries as he
focuses his team on its game and away from any media perceptions of
what is ``supposed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The media) says this, but we are very much alive,'' said
Facchin, who seems comfortable that most don't expect Italy to make
it past the first stage after advancing to the quarterfinals in its
only other World Cup appearance in 1991. ``There is no use crying
over this.''
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) Nigeria used Tuesday to scrimmage the Torrance Elite
Soccer Club, a team of mostly college players from the South Bay,
in an afternoon match at West Los Angeles College.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Falcons were flawless in a 9-0 victory with their ``B
team scoring five second-half goals, including a beautiful
one-timer by Stella Mbachu.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ismaila Mabo, who was pleased with his team's 4-3
scrimmage victory over China on Saturday, didn't know what to think
after Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be able to assess most of my team because the
opponents were no match,'' Mabo said. ``But a couple of players
played well for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria opens World Cup play Sunday against North Korea.

ORACLE'S 4TH-QUARTER EARNINGS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.)  (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Confounding its critics, the Oracle Corp.
reported revenues and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter
Tuesday that surpassed analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, which reported its financial results after the close of
the market, announced earlier that it was laying off 325 employees
_ less than 1 percent of its total 43,000-person global work force
_ effective immediately, as it moved to trim costs. The job cuts
are part of an effort to reduce operating expenses by $1 billion
over the next 18 months and remake Oracle as an Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle shares closed at $25.125, down $1.3125, in Nasdaq trading
Tuesday, but traded as high as $28.875 after hours.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended May 31, Oracle said that earnings rose 31
percent to $527.4 million, or 36 cents a diluted share, from $402.8
million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier, as revenues grew 22
percent to $2.94 billion from $2.41 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Oracle to earn 32 cents a share, according
to the First Call Corp. That estimate represented a downward
revision of the consensus from 34 cents a share; several analysts
lowered their estimates before a meeting at Oracle headquarters
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really pulled it off,'' said William Epifanio, an analyst
with J.P. Morgan, who had been among those who lowered their
numbers. Oracle's strong sales were in contrast to sluggishness
reported by most vendors of what is known as enterprise resource
planning, or ERP, software, including SAP, Peoplesoft, BAAN and JD
Edwards. They have said that Year 2000 concerns have prompted
companies to defer purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this tells me is that Oracle is successfully gaining
market share from some of the others,'' Epifanio said.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Oracle, too, had reported slowing sales of
its key data base management program, Oracle 8i, and its corporate
applications, like Oracle Financials. In the fourth quarter,
Oracle's software license revenue grew by 22 percent, year over
year. Data base software sales grew by 25 percent, while
application sales grew by 28 percent. Service revenues grew by 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Oracle reported a 35 percent gain in earnings to
$1.29 billion, or 87 cents a diluted share, from $813.7 million, or
54 cents a share, in fiscal 1998. Revenues grew 24 percent to $8.83
billion from $7.14 billion.

EDITORIAL: NEW MANAGEMENT FOR THE NUCLEAR LABS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, June 16:
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, in charge of America's nuclear weapons
labs for the past two decades, has proved incapable of assuring
security or effective management at these vital facilities. The
department's prolonged failure to pursue serious nuclear espionage
allegations at Los Alamos and its resistance to last year's White
House directive on improving security are only the latest alarming
examples of a deep-rooted institutional problem. That is the
scathing conclusion reached by a presidential advisory board after
a three-month review with full access to classified material. The
board rightly recommends reorganizing nuclear weapons programs to
establish clear lines of accountability.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board, headed by former Sen.r Warren Rudman, offers two
alternatives _ a semi-independent agency within the Energy
Department or a fully independent agency reporting directly to the
White House. Either way, the new agency would have responsibility
for scientific research, security and the labs' exchange programs
with Russia and China designed to promote nuclear arms control.
Based on the report's account of Energy Department security
failures, bureaucratic arrogance and resistance to reform from
within, a fully independent agency accountable to the highest
political authorities seems best. Although the panel recognized the
changes ordered by Bill Richardson since he took over the Energy
Department last year, it judged that these had not yet transformed
the department's ``dysfunctional'' culture.
</P>
<P>
   While security issues need more focused attention, it would be
wrong to return to Cold War secrecy. An important part of the labs'
work today consists of work that should not be classified, like
improving techniques for verifying compliance with arms treaties
and developing methods for the safe disposal of discarded bomb
plutonium and uranium. It is also important that lab scientists not
be blocked from interchange with American universities.
</P>
<P>
   But the new agency must safeguard vital military secrets. Rudman
and his colleagues have shown how to do that in a powerful,
balanced report.

<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush is literally golden, with a ruddy glow that gives
him the look of having been perfectly toasted. ``I know what
matters is that a candidate have a positive, hopeful, upbeat,
optimistic message,'' he said at a rally in New Hampshire this
week, going on to assure the crowd that he himself was positive,
hopeful, upbeat and optimistic as all get-out.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the governor of Texas had been campaigning for
president for approximately 40 hours, and appeared to have pretty
much wrapped up the Republican nomination. The average voter, who
could not identify Bush in a lineup, nevertheless seems to like him
much better than Al Gore, rating him higher in almost every
possible category of achievement. The way things are going we will
probably soon hear that polls show most Americans think Bush would
do a better job as Tipper's husband. It would be enough to make
even Bob Dole giddy.
</P>
<P>
   The cheer absolutely pulsates through his campaign. Bush has a
Clintonian determination to win over every single individual in a
crowded ballroom, and if one stray voter seems oblivious to his
presence he will go after that lost little sheep, grabbing an arm
or clapping a back until contact is made. He can work a room for
hours, till no hand is left unshaken. This is a good day to be
alive! Later he will make his formal speech, which is always about
being a compassionate conservative, and he will perhaps tell a
little story about his mother, the former first lady, or his dad,
the ex-president, or remind them of all the successes he achieved
governing Texas during one of the greatest economic booms in the
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being in New Hampshire!'' Bush says over and over.
</P>
<P>
   And New Hampshire loves Bush. Its famously dour inhabitants are
making money hand over fist these days, and they are positive,
hopeful, upbeat and optimistic, too. Frankly, the Republicans there
do not seem nearly as interested in the principles of compassionate
conservatism as they are bonded to Bush's euphoria. They like all
the candidates! Larry Emerton, an uncommitted state legislator, has
hardly had time to decide whom to support this time around, what
with the way his real estate business has been going like
gangbusters. He thinks Bush would be a terrific nominee even though
he has been a longtime backer of Lamar Alexander (``He's a nice
guy'') and admires just about everybody else as well. ``I even like
Bill Bradley,'' says Emerton, as he watches Bush spreading cheer at
the Republican Women's Lilac Luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is supposed to be on a mission to recapture the Republican
Party from extremism, just as Bill Clinton took back the Democrats
for the moderate middle in 1992. At this moment, his job seems
beyond easy. The forces of right-wing righteousness whose howling
scared away voters over the last two elections are already in
retreat. When Bush implicitly declares war against Pat Buchanan in
the free-trade section of his stump speech (``The fearful build
walls, the confident tear them down!'') he is really paying
Buchanan the compliment of pretending he's on the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   However, the old, angry Republican Party is still alive and
yelping in Washington, where it is currently engaged in a war
against gun control and a fratricidal feud over the budget. Bush
actually shares many of its positions on matters like guns and
abortion and tax cuts. (When asked to name the first two things he
would do as president, Bush, who didn't appear to have thought
quite that specifically about the future, basically said he would
build more antiballistic-missile systems and cut taxes for the
wealthy.) But the mean-spiritedness of the capital is anathema to
his message of cooperation and inclusion _ there's plenty to go
around and nobody should be left out.
</P>
<P>
   It would be interesting to see Bush and the House Republicans
trying to inhabit the same ticket. At the candidate's first stop in
New Hampshire, someone asked him what he had to say about Congress'
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the welfare package was great,'' he said, reverting
to Bill Clinton's first term. Asked for something more recent he
laughed, and called 1996 ``recent memory.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the only time all week that George W. Bush looked
backward.

 BOEING LANDS HUGE ORDER FOR 737s AT PARIS SHOW  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ International Lease Finance Corp. has ordered 50 of
Boeing's next generation 737s with options for 50 more, making it
the biggest order ever for the next generation family of airplanes
built in Renton, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   With the options, the value of the order is about $4.5 billion
based on the average list price of the various mix of planes.
</P>
<P>
   But International Lease reportedly received steep discounts from
Boeing, so much so that some analysts said Boeing may still be
going for market share over archrival Airbus Industrie rather than
trying to improve its minuscule commercial profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not true,'' Alan Mulally, president of the
Commercial Airplanes group, said in an interview following the
order announcement Tuesday at the Paris Air Show.
</P>
<P>
   He said the deal was good business, for Boeing and International
Lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of this deal,'' Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said its goal is to increase profit margins on its
commercial airplanes to 10 percent, and Mulally said the
transaction with International Lease was ``supportive of Boeing's
approach toward making a reasonable financial return ... this is
absolutely supportive of moving in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   At an earlier news conference for the order announcement, Steven
Udvar-Hazy, president and chief executive of International Lease,
was asked about the discount his leasing company received for the
737-700s, 737-800s and 737-900s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only say we did not pay retail price,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said negotiations took six months, and he described them as
``hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A transaction of this size is very complex,'' he said, adding
that he believes the final result was a ``win-win'' situation for
Boeing and International Lease.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is under a lot of pressure to improve its commercial
financial performance, and top executives have vowed they will
sacrifice market share for profitability, even if it means losing
an order on price to Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   But Byron Callan, aerospace analyst for Merrill Lynch who is in
Paris for the air show, said if the discounts are as steep as he
has heard, then he would begin to question Boeing's commitment to
better jetliner margins.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delivered a record 563 commercial jetliners last year,
but made no profit on those planes. Mulally, in the interview, said
Boeing has not changed its previous projection that commercial
margins this year and next will be 2 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nisbet, an industry analyst with JSA Research, did a recent
analysis that concluded Boeing last year sold its planes below the
cost of producing them, with average prices paid by customers 14
percent to 27 percent below list prices.
</P>
<P>
   Nisbet did his analysis to quantify Boeing's practice of
discounting its jetliners to customers in its price war with
Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Tuesday, Nisbet said he does not know
how much discount Boeing gave International Lease on the 50 firm
orders.
</P>
<P>
   But the discount was likely steep, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a foregone conclusion that these huge orders from
leasing companies are full of deep discounts because they mean so
much to Boeing and Airbus in terms of market share,'' Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   One factor to consider in trying to understand if the deal is
good for Boeing is the delivery date of the planes ordered, he
said. If the deliveries mean Boeing can keep production rates high,
then the cost of each plane is less. ``In that case, Boeing could
offer some discounts without hurting its earnings,'' Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Boeing probably went beyond `some' with an order of that
size,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus also announced a billion-dollar order Tuesday by
Singapore Aircraft Leasing Enterprise for 20 A320s and three A321s.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus announcement,though, was overshadowed by the
International Lease order for Boeing planes.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Udvar-Hazy said the first delivery in the
new orders will come in early 2001, and if the additional 50
airplanes are confirmed, deliveries would continue until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   He called the next generation 737 a ``cornerstone of our
portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest order brings to 360 the number of 737s that
International Leasing owns, including planes that have not yet been
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Tuesday, Boeing received orders from Korean Air Lines
Co. for two 747-400 freighters. The airline said it would replace
two Airbus A300 freighters when it accepts delivery of the new
plans, currently set or May and June of next year.

$20.4 MILLION GRANT WILL HELP LAID-OFF BOEING WORKERS  
 CORRECTS IAM LODGE NO. TO 751 FROM 752, IN 4TH GRAPH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Labor Department is sending up to $20.4 million to
Washington state to help the growing number of laid-off Boeing
workers develop skills to land new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency announced a 26-month grant on Tuesday
designed to help thousands of Boeing employees grappling with the
latest round of layoffs at the aerospace giant. Now, former
machinists, engineers and other workers will be able to tap a wider
range of employment services, ranging from help in drafting resumes
to training in new professions.
</P>
<P>
   The award comes at a critical time for Boeing's workers. The
company has already announced plans to eliminate roughly 24,000
jobs in Washington state by the end of 2000, as part of a broader
initiative to make the company leaner and more profitable. Unlike
past layoffs, however, not all the laid-off workers will be rehired
when business picks up, according to the International Association
of Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This grant is needed because aerospace machinists have skills
that are unique to airplane production,'' said Bill Johnson,
president of IAM Lodge 751, which represents more than 40,000
machinists.
</P>
<P>
   Under the grant, the state's Employment Security Department will
funnel the money to a network of private councils and consortiums.
The groups will then offer employment aid directly to both union
and non-union workers from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of public officials, including President Clinton
and Washington Gov. Gary Locke, hailed the development as a
necessary step to help U.S. firms and their workers cope with the
demands of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of an overall healthy economy, many companies are
having to reorganize and downsize to remain competitive,'' Clinton
said in a statement released in Washington, D.C., Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the grant will target the 2,400 Boeing employees
slated to be let go by the end of December, according to the Labor
Department. However, state officials have yet to receive details on
the scope of the award. And they say the federal agency may also
award additional funds to cover the rest of the workers Boeing says
it will lay off in the region by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often in these cases with large layoffs the Department of
Labor will accept additional requests to provide additional funding
later on,'' said Michael Wilson, a spokesman for the Employment
Security Department.
</P>
<P>
   To kick off the effort, the Labor Department is making $10
million immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance will come on top of career centers that Boeing
has already established to assist former employees struggling to
shift from the aerospace industry to other fields.
</P>
<P>
   The award also arrives only two months before Boeing enters
direct talks on a new contract for its 46,000 machinists. A key
negotiating point will be how the manufacturer will manage its work
force during the next four years. In the past, Boeing and its
unions have battled over the company's efforts to hire outside
contractors because the move threatened union jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the Labor Department announced a
separate $4 million grant that will assist 375 laid-off workers at
Packard Bell NEC in Fife, Intel Corp. in DuPont and Matsushita
Semiconductor in Puyallup, all in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, Boeing workers can contact
www.reachingout-washington.com for other information on employment
services.

   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ A good Stanley Cup championship round took
another determined step toward greatness Tuesday night when the
Buffalo Sabres evened the series with a 2-1 victory over the Dallas
Stars in the happy bedlam of Marine Midland Arena. All four games
have been low-scoring, with tight checking, hard hitting and
scoring chances preciously earned.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Buffalo won the test of wills with two goals after
turnovers uncharacteristic of the Dallas defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Sanderson, who scored one of the goals on a breakaway,
said: ``We were lucky we finally capitalized. They make so few''
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Dominik Hasek, Buffalo's world-class goalie, stopped 30 of 31
Stars shots and participated in a few collisions, one of which
earned him a roughing penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The series resumes in Dallas on Thursday night and returns here
for Game 6 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In four games, the Sabres have eight goals and the Stars have
nine, one of which was an empty-net goal. But low scores don't mean
boring games in baseball or soccer, and these hockey games have
been anything but dull. The older Stars and the younger Sabres are
well matched.
</P>
<P>
   The game had an angry snarl, with Buffalo forwards frequently
slamming their bodies into Derian Hatcher, the Stars' big and
rugged captain. The Dallas players responded by jostling Hasek, who
has been known to lose his temper when provoked. In one of the
game's defining moments, Hasek started an angry scrum by moving
from his crease to bump Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars played without Brett Hull, who left in the first
period of Game 3 with a groin injury. It is not known if Hull will
be available for Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams scored in the first period Tuesday, with Buffalo's
goal coming at even strength and Dallas's on the power play. The
Sabres went ahead by 1-0 when Sanderson scooped up a loose puck
after it got by Dallas defenseman Shawn Chambers at the right
point. Sanderson raced down ice, drew Stars goalie Ed Belfour down
with a fake, and put the puck past him at 8:09.
</P>
<P>
   But after Buffalo's Wayne Primeau took a charging penalty at
9:32, the Stars tied the score at 10:14 when Jere Lehtinen beat
Hasek with a low wrist shot that he took quickly after receiving
Mike Modano's pass from behind the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was among the best in the series. It ended
with the Sabres leading by 2-1 and both captains arguing with the
referees about four roughing penalties. One went to Hasek, who
charged out from his crease to run into Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek was knocked to the ice, face forward, by Pat Verbeek, a
small but tough player. Belfour, on the way to his locker room,
then approached Hasek as they left the ice and had words with him,
the second such scene in this series.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Dallas' Joe Nieuwendyk was not penalized for crashing
into Hasek, but Buffalo's Brian Holzinger was penalized for
boarding Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Those were not the only chippy plays in the period. The Stars'
Brian Skrudland was penalized for roughing after knocking off Mike
Peca's helmet after the Sabres' captain tried to check Skrudland.
On another hit, the Sabres' Rhett Warrener knocked off Dave Reid's
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres scored the only goal in the period and almost had
another. They went up by 2-1 at 7:37. The goal followed a turnover
by a Dallas defenseman, Craig Ludwig, who lost the puck in his end.
Buffalo's Dixon Ward came up with it and beat Belfour from close
range.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Belfour stopped Miroslav Satan in close with a brilliant
stick save. Satan, who had 40 goals in the regular season but has
none this series, has been under pressure from Ruff, the local news
media and fans. As the second period ended with the home team
ahead, the packed arena was filled with a steady roar.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Coach Ken Hitchcock said Sabres fans and neutral
observers were wrong to give up on Buffalo after Dallas won by 2-1
here on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The series is just getting started, and people had it
ending,'' Hitchcock said. ``It was a real good game, well played by
both sides.''

YANKS ROCK RANGERS ROOKIE IN 6-2 WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ History dictated that Ryan Glynn never had a chance.
For the Texas Rangers' right-hander to notch his first major league
victory, he had to outpitch David Cone. Sixteen previous pitchers
had sought their first victory when they faced the Yankee ace.
Their record? O-12.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn, a 24-year-old rookie, lasted six innings, gave up six
hits and was rocked for six runs as the Yankees won Tuesday night
for the fifth time in six games, 6-2, before 28,200 at Yankee
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end came early and from the sweet spots of
the Yankees' most consistent bats: Chili Davis and Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the 39-year-old designated hitter who was back in the
starting lineup after the team's weeklong tour of the National
League, ignited a six-run second inning with a single to the right
field gap that scored Bernie Williams. Jeter finished the rally
with a three-run homer to right field that put the Yankees ahead by
6-1.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the Yankees batted around for the 14th time this
season and cranked out more than five runs for the 11th time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a lead like that you can afford to make a few
mistakes,'' said Cone, who, while running his record to 7-2, made
very few of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees took advantage of every mistake made by a pitcher
making just his seventh appearance in the big leagues. Glynn (0-1)
walked Bernie Williams to open the second, then watched Tino
Martinez rip a grounder by him and up the middle. Next came Davis,
who spent last week's interleague road trip in Florida and
Philadelphia taking extra batting practice because the designated
hitter rule is not in effect in the National League cities.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever accused him of being a glove man _ in fact, he
set the California Angels' team record for errors by an outfielder
with 19 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But he takes his role seriously and, despite getting just four
at bats in six games last week, Davis is now 4 for 8 in the last
two games. He went 2 for 3 against the Rangers to raise his average
to .332.
</P>
<P>
   When Glynn offered him a fastball, he drilled it into the right
field gap for a single to score Williams and tally his 42nd RBI _
second on the Yankees only to Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good, professional hitter,'' said manager Joe Torre,
who appreciated Davis taking his week off without complaint. ``He
works the pitcher until he gets something he can hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn got Shane Spencer to fly out before Luis Sojo snapped out
of his 0-for 14 slump with a double to left that brought Martinez
home and put the Yankees up by 2-1. But then the pitcher threw ball
four past Chuck Knoblauch, as well as his catcher Greg Zaun, and
Davis scored.
</P>
<P>
   But the pitcher hadn't even been welcomed to the majors yet by
the game's hottest hitter. Jeter came into the game with seven
consecutive multiple-hit games, a .382 batting average, and little
desire to talk about numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to do well, but I think people get caught up in the
stats just because you're hitting certain numbers,'' said Jeter,
who came into the game with a major-league-leading 91 hits.
</P>
<P>
   When Glynn tried to get Jeter to chase an 0-1 curve, the
shortstop poked it into the right field bleachers for a 6-1 lead.
It was enough for the Yankees, but not for Jeter, whose
multiple-hit streak was snapped _ he struck out in his other three
at bats. ``I really didn't swing the bat that well,'' Jeter
conceded. ``But I had one big hit and more often than not when you
give David Cone a six-run lead, you're going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Before turning the game over to Ramiro Mendoza in the eighth,
Cone scattered four hits and struck out six. In the second, he
walked Rafael Palmeiro, then gave up a run-scoring double to Lee
Stevens to fall behind, 1-0. Those two also got to Cone in the
seventh inning when Palmeiro singled and Stevens moved him to third
with a double. Zaun hit a sacrifice fly to score Palmeiro for the
Rangers' last run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's held us together all year,'' said Torre. ``We've had
problems in our rotation with El Duque being flat and Clemens not
being where he wants. David has been consistent all year long.''
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to the Yankees in 1995, Cone has won consistently
even when he hasn't had his best stuff. He is 55-19 with a 3.20 ERA
in a Yankee uniform and 31-6 with a 3.00 ERA in Yankee Stadium. And
Tuesday night, he said, he found some of the old pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lead and you can rear back and find that fastball,''
he said. ``What I've been proud of is that even without my best
stuff I've been able to keep us in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   When reminded of his dominance over rookie pitchers trying to
get that first victory under their belt, Cone smiled. He cautioned
that Yankee Stadium and the fact that the Yanks were the defending
World Series champions contributed to Glynn's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge test and I thought he threw pretty well,'' Cone
said. ``He had one bad inning, really.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's all it took.

METS DEFEAT REDS, 11-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Rickey Henderson has two trademarks: the stolen
base and the leadoff home run. Make that three, if you count the
way Henderson always picks at his uniform jersey leaving the
batter's box when he knows he has just hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when the Mets matched a club record with six home
runs and Henderson hit two, Henderson led off Tuesday's game with a
homer for the first time as a member of the Mets. It was one of
three homers by his team in the first 18 pitches of a game that
turned into an 11-3 rout of the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   But Henderson did not pick at his jersey, even though he had
just extended his major-league record to 74 homers leading off a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit the first one, they all asked me why I didn't do
it,'' Henderson said referring to his teammates. ``So I had to hit
another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson did just that in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The homer splurge helped make it a day to remember for Manager
Bobby Valentine. His two-game suspension and $5,000 fine were
upheld Tuesday afternoon by National League president Leonard
Coleman after Coleman heard Valentine's appeal over the phone. The
suspension will cover the game here Wednesday afternoon and one in
St. Louis Thursday night. Bench coach, Bruce Benedict, will be in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Valentine was in the Mets' dugout, too busy
high-fiving homer hitters to worry about his ban. With Henderson
leading the way, the Mets homered three times off the the first 18
pitches delivered by Brett Tomko. By the time the first inning was
over, John Olerud and Mike Piazza had homered in consecutive
at-bats. Olerud's came with a man on. Piazza's extended his hitting
streak to 18 games. And the Mets had a 4-0 lead before a Reds'
player had batted.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the evening was over, Edgardo Alfonzo and Matt
Franco had homered off Tomko, and Henderson had homered again, this
time off Jason Bere. Only once before in the 38-year history of the
franchise had the Mets homered six times in a game: on April 4,
1988, opening day, in Montreal. Darryl Strawberry hit two, as did
Kevin McReynolds, and Kevin Elster and Lenny Dykstra belted the
other ones.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, six of the Mets' first eight hits were home runs,
which accounted for the Mets' first seven runs. All of which helped
Rick Reed (4-3) coast to his first victory since May 12, a span of
six starts, even though he was pitching with a urinary tract
infection that almost made it necessary for him to return to New
York this morning instead of taking the mound tonight.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed woke up feeling better at 4 a.m, and felt even better
after allowing 2 runs and 8 hits in 8 innings, matching the longest
outing by a Mets' starter this season. As for Tomko, he somehow
made it through 6 innings, allowing 6 runs on 7 hits, of them home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the three times the Mets have faced Tomko this year, they
have hit 9 home runs. The last time they had hit consecutive home
runs, it was against Tomko, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's outburst by Henderson means he has reached base
seven times in nine plate appearances over the last two days (4
walks, 1 double, 2 home runs).

<P>
   Five months after Sotheby's announced a $25 million initiative
to begin its own online auction business, it has entered into an
alliance with Amazon.com. The two will begin selling art and
collectibles later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement merges Amazon's online expertise and broad
customer reach with Sotheby's reputation as an authority in the
business of selling fine and decorative arts. ``We are bringing to
the table technology, customer service and an introduction to 10
million people,'' said Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive
officer of Amazon.com. ``One of the biggest problems in the online
auction business is the ability to authenticate what we sell and
that's something Sotheby's can help us do. There's no other partner
out there that could help us build this.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Amazon is making a $35 million investment
in the York Avenue auction house. It has agreed to purchase 1
million shares of Class A common stock at about $35 a share. Amazon
is also buying a warrant for $10 million that entitles it to
purchase an additional 1 million shares of Sotheby's Class A stock
at a price of $100 a share. Amazon's total investment is about $45
million.
</P>

   There will now be three different auction sites, all available
by clicking on Amazon.com. Amazon will keep its three-month old
auction business, which can be reached on its general Web site.
Like a gigantic flea market, it sells everything from washing
machines to Andy Warhol art to a $75,000 space capsule. Anyone,
whether they be a dealer or a collector, can buy and sell on this
site, but Amazon will only guarantee purchases of up to $250.

   Sothebys.amazon.com will offer all areas of collectibles from
coins and jewelry to porcelains and Barbie dolls, but sellers will
be only professional dealers and they will be responsible for
guaranteeing the objects they sell.

   The third site, Sothebys.com, will sell the more traditional
auction-house fare, such as paintings, furniture and decorative
objects. For this site, the seller, whether a dealer or Sotheby's,
will also guarantee all the property. All three sites will be
available by clicking on either Amazon.com or Sothebys.com.

   ``We haven't thought of these different sites as having
different price points but rather each having different and special
characters,'' said Diana Brooks, Sotheby's chief executive. ``Now
dealers from around the world will be able to offer their property
to an unlimited number of potential bidders and buyers will be able
to participate in some of the most exciting online auctions.''
