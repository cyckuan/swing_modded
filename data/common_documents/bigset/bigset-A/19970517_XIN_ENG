<HEADLINE> Solana Briefs German Leaders on NATO-Russia Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
said here today that the security pact reached between the western
military alliance and Russia two days ago was approved by NATO
countries today and will be made public within days after the
verification of different language versions of the text.
</P>
<P>
Solana is in Bonn today to brief German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on details of the new security
pact between NATO and Russia, announced by himself and Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov in Moscow on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after his talks with Kinkel,
Solana said it was a "historic agreement in which everybody is a
winner, and nobody is a loser". He stressed that the accord would
bring more security, more stability and the possibility for more
prosperity in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the document, to be signed by NATO
countries and Russia on May 27 in Paris, will not be legally
binding, and thus will not require ratification by parliaments.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Council, NATO's governing body, approved the
document in Brussels this morning. The pact defines relations,
cooperation and security between NATO and Russia in view of the
planned expansion of the alliance to take in former Soviet bloc
countries in central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Russia has strongly opposed NATO expansion, insisting that it
will create new gulfs in Europe and threaten its security. Russia
wanted NATO to guarantee that it would not station nuclear
weapons or military forces on the territory of new members and
would not use military facilities left over by the former Warsaw
Pact Organization in those countries.
</P>
<P>
Solana said today NATO had already made a statement in December
last year which said it had "no reason, no plan and no intention"
to station nuclear weapons in new member states. That statement
had been incorporated in the new document, he said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement doesn't go into detail about military facilities,
Solana said. But NATO will be able to utilize the infrastructure
needed to undertake missions for "collective defence" and for
peace-keeping, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's basic security concerns would be taken care of by a
joint consultation mechanism to be created between NATO and Russia
where the two sides "will construct a close, deep, and profound
relationship," Solana said.
</P>
<P>
Both Solana and Kinkel stopped short of saying which countries
will be invited to join NATO in the first wave. Solana said the
decision had not yet been made but would without doubt be made
during the NATO summit on July 8-9 in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that the Czech Republic, Hungary, and
Poland will be the first candidates.
</P>
<P>
Solana said a declaration defining relations between NATO and
Ukraine would also be formally signed at the NATO summit in July.

<HEADLINE> China to Implement "One Country-Two Systems" After Hong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China will implement the "one
country-two systems" policy after Hong Kong's reversion so as to
maintain the region's stability and prosperity, a senior Chinese
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The "one country-two systems" policy, initiated by late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping, is not an interim policy, its is a
solidly-established and long-standing policy of China, Lu Ping,
director of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, told an
international conference on Asia's future.
</P>
<P>
China wants to preserve Hong Kong's economy as it provides
great benefits to China's modernization and opening to the
outside. The best way to achieve this is to implement the policy,
lu said.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) will retain its present economic and social systems for at
least the next 50 years. The Hong Kong SAR will still implement
the systems and policies of capitalism and retain a high of
autonomy in all areas except for defense and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official also expressed his belief that Hong Kong's
future government, under the leadership of Tung Chee-hwa, will do
its utmost to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew also addressed the
conference, predicting that business in Hong Kong will be as
usual after its handover.
</P>
<P>
Lee, former Singapore prime minister, said he was confident of
Hong Kong's post-1997 future because its economy is in
exceptionally good shape, with local and international confidence
in it as a high level.

<HEADLINE> Zairian President Mobutu Leaves His Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, Zaire May 16 (Xinhua) _ Zairian President Mobutu Sese
Seko has given up running the government and left the capital
today, his information minister Kin-Kiey said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said to reporters that Mobutu would retain the
title of president. It appeared, however, that Mobutu was
retreating from any significant role in Zaire as rebels close in
on the capital, Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Mobutu had "ceased all intervention in
the conduct of affairs of state. He reigns but does not govern."
</P>
<P>
Mobutu's departure followed reports that his three top generals
told him they could not and would not defend the capital.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu slipped out of the capital so quietly today that many
residents did not know he was gone.
</P>
<P>
The capital was calm, with markets, shops and restaurants open
and the streets filled with residents. But truckloads of
machine-gun toting soldiers were out in force today along the road
to the airport.
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there was a strong chance that Mobutu would flee the country
today. French TV TF1 said Mobutu was going to Morocco, then on to
France, where he has a villa on the Riviera.

<HEADLINE> US Housing Construction Up 2.6 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The housing starts in the U.S.
increased by 2.6 percent in April resulting from the fastest pace
of apartment building in seven years, the U.S. Commerce Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the housing starts rose to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.47 million units following a sharp 7.7
percent drop in March and a 13 percent jump in February.
</P>
<P>
Single-family construction inched only 0.3 percent higher last
month to 1.12 million units. Builders began construction of
two-to-four-unit buildings at an annual rate of 41,000, up 2.5
percent. But the starts of apartment buildings reached to the
highest level since January 1990.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. housing starts in the first four months of this
year declined by a modest 3.5 percent comparing with the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, housing starts in the South were up by 11.3 percent
in the month, the largest increase in the country and the highest
in the region since July 1995. Starts edged 0.7 percent higher in
the Midwest following a 24.9 percent drop in March. But housing
starts fell by 7.4 percent in the Northeast and 6.5 percent in the
West.
</P>
<P>
In a signal of future activity, applications for housing
permits fell by 0.8 percent in April to an annual rate of 1.45
million units. Permits for multi-unit construction, from two units
up, dropped by 9.7 percent to a rate of 382,000 units. Those for
single-family rose 2.9 percent to a rate of 1.06 million units.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Friday that the departure of President
Mobutu Sese Seko opened the way for peaceful resolution of the
conflict in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kinshasa said Mobutu left the Zairian capital for
his northern palace and a spokesman for the government said at a
press conference that the president "ceased all intervention in
the affairs of the state."
</P>
<P>
The Zairian government statement indicated that Mobutu
apparently ended his 32-year rule of the central African country,
observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Before her talks with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy,
Albright told reporters: "We believe that his departure now opens
the way for a peaceful resolution of the military conflict."
</P>
<P>
"We are at this stage working with all the parties so that we
can avoid bloodshed and also to do what can be done in terms of
contributing to a process that would be peaceful and have an
inclusive transition that would result in free and fair
elections," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I think the most important point here is that Zaire now needs
to move forward away from war towards peace, stability and
elections," she added.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Urged To Keep Duty-Free In EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide consumer awareness
campaign was launched here today by the Duty-Free Confederation
(DFC), as part of the fight to prevent the abolition of duty and
tax-free shopping in the EU in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
In its initial phase, three million leaflets will be
distributed to consumers at airport shops, on airlines and ferries
and in ticket wallets over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
The leaflets have a freepost tear-off slip which consumers can
send back to the Duty-Free Confederation for further information
on how they can help.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are encouraged to write to their local MP and MEP
telling them their views and make the point that everybody
benefits from duty-free.
</P>
<P>
A Duty-Freephone hotline has also been set up to provide
consumers with information on how they will be affected by the
abolition and give them assistance with how they can help.
</P>
<P>
It is claimed that up to 33,000 jobs in the European ferry
industry and tourism could be lost and half of the ferry services
serving Britain and Ireland could be withdrawn if the European
Union abolishes duty-free sales.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the campaign is to persuade European governments
to authorize a further extension of cross-border duty-free
privileges originally planned to end when the single European
market was created in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
"Duty free is not just a valuable perk for the holiday
motorist, it is an integral part of the funding of sea and air
travel," said Barry Goddard, Secretary General of the DFC.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately it is the consumers who will bear the cost of the
abolition of duty and tax-free shopping, he added.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Rebels' Attacks Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Parliament of Sierra Leone on
Thursday passed without dissent a private member's motion
condemning the resumption of attacks by the rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
The motion also called on the government ''to take prompt
action'' to protect life and property and ''to legalise civil
defence units'' in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to independent sources, there are about three main
civil defence units in the country, established mainly on a
regional basis, the most prominent being the Kamajors and the
Kapras.
</P>
<P>
Legislators also called for the setting up of a war council
but no decision was made on the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
A total of 30 people died during RUF attack on Bomaru in the
east of the country last Monday.
</P>
<P>
A member of parliament on Wednesday told the legislature about
the attack but gave no casualty figure.
</P>
<P>
Travellers arriving in the capital said 23 civilians died and
28 others were wounded and now admitted at a hospital in
Segbwema.
</P>
<P>
''The condition of most of the wounded are very serious as they
were butchered with blunt machetes and other crude weapons,'' one
Sierra Leone Red Cross official said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Fails to Meet EU Beef Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Reduced slaughter stock and the
madcow disease scare last year resulted in a lower tonnage of
beef exports to the European Union market by the Zimbabwe's
state-owned Cold Storage Company (CSC), an official said today.
</P>
<P>
CSC Public Relations Manager Joyce Sibanda said that the
parastatal only managed to export 6,600 tonnes of beef worth 23.6
million US dollars, falling short of its annual quota of 9,100
tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda said, ''CSC's performance in 1996 was affected by a
number of factors, namely low throughput due to the reduced
slaughter stock in the country, and the BSE (madcow disease)
scare in Europe which led to a drop in consumption and price
levels, and temporary suspension of exports into the United
Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
She said the export market this year would depend on
throughput as the national herd had still not recovered to the
pre-drought levels.
</P>
<P>
She added the CSC would, however, want the government to
renegotiate the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Protocol and
ask the EU to increase its beef quota in the year 2000. enditem

<HEADLINE> IMF to Support Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said today it is ready to support Zimbabwe's economic
reform program once the southern African country finalises the
blue print for the second phase of the reforms.
</P>
<P>
IMF Deputy Managing Director Alassane Ouattara said in Harare
support would resume as soon as the Zimbabwe government has put
in place a satisfactory policy package to ensure success of the
second phase of reforms scheduled to start this year.
</P>
<P>
He said while there were signs of positive growth over the
past year, there was still need to consolidate the gains realised
so far by putting in place prudent economic policies that could
sustain the growth.
</P>
<P>
He added, ''this country has great potential and to achieve
this, the country needs not only increased support from local
institutions but also the international community.''
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended disbursement of 91 million US dollars in
1995 after accusing Zimbabwe of missing agreed economic targets
under the first phase of reforms.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and other donors want Zimbabwe to cut its budget
deficit to at least five percent of GDP, although this is proving
to be an elusive goal, as admitted this week by Zimbabwean
Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa who said the deficit would shoot
to 11.4 percent of GDP by the year ending June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ouattara, who arrived in the country on Thursday, and
President Robert Mugabe discussed earlier the economic situation
in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He was expected to leave Zimbabwe for Tanzania on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Mobutu Leaves Kinshasa to "Stay in Background" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko
left Kinshasa today for his fief Gbadolite in northern Zaire, in
order to "stay in the background," said the Zairian government
today.
</P>
<P>
"In order not to appear as an obstacle to a negotiated
solution and the constitutional order, the president has decided
to stay in the background," the Zairian council of ministers
(cabinet) said in a communique.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has not announced the resignation of
Mobutu, who has ruled Zaire for 32 years.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic source in Rabat, Morocco, said that Mobutu asked
on Thursday the right to make a stopover of his plane in Rabat in
the coming few days. King Hassan II of Morocco is a close friend
of Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States State Department said that the
Zairian rebel forces led by Laurent-Desire Kabila are continuing
their advance toward Kinshasa, and are now 35 to 50 kilometers
from the capital.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Secretary of State Madelaine Albright said that the
departure of Mobutu "has opened the way to a peaceful solution of
the military conflict" and said that Washington is keeping
contact with both sides of the Zairian conflict to avoid "flow of
blood."
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse quoted a source of Zairian rebels as
saying that some advanced units of the rebels are near the
international airport of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry said today that it does not have
any information on a possible arrival of Mobutu in France, where
the president owns a luxury villa near the southern Mediterranean
city of Nice.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government today froze Mobutu's properties in
Switzerland, including a villa 40 kilometers south of Lausanne, at
the demand of the Zairian rebels.

UNITED NATIONS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council on
Friday approved an increase in strength of U.N. International
Police Task Force in Bosnia by 120 police personnel.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimously adopted resolution, the council urged member
states to provide qualified police monitors and other forms of
assistance and support to the force.
</P>
<P>
The council took the move at the suggestion of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
He said a substantial number of police experts were needed on
human rights investigation, monitoring of the local police,
strengthening of police training, police restructuring and the
development of guidelines for democratic policing.

<HEADLINE> Smuggled Clothing Threatens Zimbabwe's Textile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's largest textile company
today warned the industry's futute is under serious threat from
smuggled goods.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of David Whitehead Textiles Ltd Chris Parvin said unless
regional governments tightened border controls, the domestic market
share of textile and clothing companies would continue to be eroded
by cheap imports, particularly from the Far East.
</P>
<P>
''The regional market, including South Africa, is plagued with the
same problems facing Zimbabwean textile manufacturers, particularly
smuggled and under-invoiced goods,'' Parvin said in a statement
accompanying the company's half-year results for the period to March
1997.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''We understand that in South Africa, the Customs
department are recruiting additional inspectors to try and contain
these illegal imports.''
</P>
<P>
''If these goods find their way into the regional markets, further
damage to textile and clothing companies will result,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He denied that local textile and clothing companies were not
competitive as alleged by some critics, saying their problems were to
a large extent caused by unfair competition, as well as the
government's excessive expenditure, which resulted in high inflation
and interest rates. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Urged to Use PTA  Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Finance Minister Herbert
Murerwa has challenged the country's entrepreneurs to utilise
facilities offered by the PTA Bank amid concern by indigenous
business people that they are shunned by existing financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa, who was recently elected chairman of the Board of
Governors of the Eastern and Southern African Trade and Development
Bank (PTA Bank), today said despite being one of the largest
shareholders in the regional bank, Zimbabwe had not submitted
projects last year for funding under the bank's project finance
scheme.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''the board has therefore agreed to set up an office in
the region to generate interest in bank activities within the
region.''
</P>
<P>
Last year only seven among the PTA bank's 15 member states
accessed the bank's project financing facilities.
</P>
<P>
This was the second consecutive year the bank has slowed down its
project financing operations in an attempt to consolidate project
monitoring and other credit delievery procedures.
</P>
<P>
The PTA Bank was formed in 1985 to further the aims of the
preferential trade area (now COMESA) by financing projects designed
to make the economies of member states complementary to each other.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Hopes "Democratic Transition" in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Upon the departure of Zairian
President Mobutu Sese Seko, U.S. President Bill Clinton said on
Friday that the United States would exert its efforts to help
Zaire on the road toward a "democratic transition."
</P>
<P>
"The United States' position is clear," Clinton said. "We want
to see a transition to a genuine democracy."
</P>
<P>
He pledged to "do what we can" to promote a "democratic
transition in one of the largest and most important nations in
Africa."
</P>
<P>
Mobutu flew off to Gbadolite, north of the capital of Kinshasa,
on Friday for what his spokesman called a "short rest."
</P>
<P>
Hours later, the information minister announced that Mobutu had
"ceased all intervention in the conduct of affairs of state."
</P>
<P>
"He reigns but does not govern," Information Minister Kin-Kiey
Mulumba told a press conference. He said Mobutu retains a title.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged worldwide support for the efforts of South
African President Nelson Mandela, who he said had done "a superb
job" in trying to end the violent conflicts in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"I want the whole world to get behind him," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the
departure of President Mobutu Sese Seko "opens the way for a
peaceful resolution of the military conflict."
</P>
<P>
"We are at this stage working with all the parties so that we
can avoid bloodshed and also to do what can be done in terms of
contributing to a process that would be peaceful and have an
inclusive transition that would result in free and fair
elections," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I think the most important point here is that Zaire now
needs to move forward away from war towards peace, stability and
elections," she added.

<HEADLINE> Ross Leaves Middle East For Home Empty-Handed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace
coordinator Dennis Ross is leaving the region for home tonight
after failing to bridge the gaps between the Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived last week, met in his Jerusalem hotel with
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai early this morning to brief him
on his fruitless attempts in the past 24 hours to bring the two
parties back to talks, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Mordechai himself took part in a three-way
meeting at the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin
Indyk in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai and Ross exchanged views and ideas on the
possibility of advancing the process with the Palestinians despite
what he called the existing gaps between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Later in the morning, Ross received the EU special envoy to
the Middle East peace process, Ambassador Miguel Angel
Moratinos. Moratinos said after the meeting that the situation was
not so bad.
</P>
<P>
"There is still a big gap. Two elements, land and security, are
two issues that have to be focused on in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Ross met with Abu Mazen, PLO secretary
general. Originally, Ross was scheduled to hold talks with
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat Thursday night. But Arafat
called off the meeting, saying that the U.S. envoy was siding with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told the
weekly cabinet meeting that there is no real progress in the
contacts between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
According to a cabinet statement, Netanyahu said that the
sides raised demands when they met this week, but the
Palestinians appear interested in what he called creating an
artificial crisis to prevent progress in the diplomatic
process.
</P>
<P>
Israel demanded security cooperation resume while the
Palestinian side asked for a halt to the settlement construction
in Har Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials complained that the U.S. had not pushed
Israel hard enought to stop its settlement expansion drive.

<HEADLINE> Greece Rejects Dutch Proposal on Experts Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece today rejected a proposal by
the Dutch EU presidency for a direct meeting between the Greek-
Turkish Committees of Experts formed recently to examine the
differences between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the proposal that the two committees should meet
between May 26 and 28, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos
described the proposal as "naive" and "mistaken", saying that such
a meeting would serve "no useful purpose."
</P>
<P>
Pangalos confirmed that he received a letter today from his
Dutch counterpart Hans Van Mierlo proposing a direct meeting of
the two committees at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos stressed that first of all, the process of exchanging
views by correspondence must proceed.
</P>
<P>
"If the aim of the EU presidency is to exert pressure for the
commencement of direct talks, in order to secure the release of
the EU-Turkey financial protocol, then it is a naive approach,
because Greece has repeatedly stated that it will not consent to
the release of these funds unless Turkey satisfies the three
conditions set by Athens," he said.
</P>
<P>
He assured however that the procedure regarding the committees
would continue, adding that the letter of the Greek side would be
sent to the Dutch presidency at the beginning of next week, on the
condition however that the Van Mierlo proposal for a meeting of
the committees is withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
Athens has insisted that relations between Greece and Turkey
could be improved only if Ankara could meet the three conditions
set by Greece, namely Ankara must reject the use and threat of
force, respect international law and treaties, and have recourse
to the International Court at the Hague for the settlement of any
claims it might have.

<HEADLINE> Countries Involved Urged to Show Real Interest on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has urged
all countries, which are involved in the Cyprus problem, to show
their actual interest in the planned direct talks between the
Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing today, Government
Spokesman Manolis Christofides said that for the first time ever,
so many countries have simultaneously show their interest in a
Cyprus solution by appointing their own special representatives.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the countries, which have declared their intention
to help the U.N. Secretary-General's good offices mission, and
especially the Security council five permanent members, to show
in practical terms their real interest during direct talks,"
Christofides said.
</P>
<P>
The direct talks would probably convene in late June.
</P>
<P>
"Wishful thinking has failed for decades to bring about a
settlement," the Spokesman said, adding that something more
decisive is needed.
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain the term "real interest", the Spokesman said
"this might be interventions, pressure on Turkey, Denktash and
other parties, to get replies to six or seven key questions on
Cyprus, pending for years."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Chief, he said, "takes the responsibility to issue
invitations to the two sides for direct talks as well as his own
share of responsibility in a possible failure".
</P>
<P>
However, Christofides made it clear that both the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides will also be responsible for an eventual
failure, if talks collapse.
</P>
<P>
After two-months of U.N.-led proximity talks between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is
expected to issue invitations to President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to have face-to-face talks
in June, possibly in New York.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Under-Secretary General Sir Kieran Prendergast is
currently in Cyprus for talks with Clerides and Denktash for
finishing touches on the proposed direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after the Turkish troops took control of its
northern third in the wake of a short-lived coup seeking union
with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Israel Bombards Hezbollah Bases in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out today
some 15 rounds of bombing at guerrilla positions of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon today.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Israeli artillery fired more than 400 shells
at the same targets.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon reported that the Israeli
warplanes unleashed one round of bombing in every 20 minutes
since 8:00 a.m. local time (05:00 GMT) and until the noon at
targets on the hill of Telal Al-Dhahr in Western Beqaa, some 85
kilometers southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes launched a dozen of air-to-surface missiles and
shot bursts of machinegun fires in the air strikes, the anonymous
sources reported, noting that no casualties were caused.
</P>
<P>
In a separate raid, Israeli helicopters rocketed a Lebanese
army checkpoint on the edge of the Israeli self-proclaimed
"security zone," the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas and Lebanese army units in Western Beqaa
fired with anti-air weapons at the Israeli warplanes, but missed
the targets.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery fired more than 50 shells at areas around
the attacked guerrilla positions in the morning.
</P>
<P>
At 1:00 p.m. (10:00 a.m. GMT), the Israeli forces in the border
strip resumed the bombardments and fired more 120mm and 150mm
shells.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the U.N. peacekeeping forces operating in south
Lebanon reported that more than 400 artillery shells were fired at
Western Beqaa today.
</P>
<P>
The air raids came hours after a violent clash between
Hezbollah fighters and Israeli commandos near Telal Al-Dhahr
overnight.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army admitted that in the fighting, which lasted from
9:00 p.m. (18:00 GMT) until 0:10 a.m. (21:10 GMT), three Israeli
soldiers were killed and seven others wounded, the worst loss for
the 1,000-strong Israeli forces in a single clash since this year.
</P>
<P>
General Amiran Levine, commander of Israel's northern military
area, said the clash erupted when the Israeli commandos were
fulfilling a routine mission inside the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the exchange of fire with the guerrillas in a
short distance, one Israeli soldier was killed and two others were
wounded, and the commandos sustained additional casualties during
evacuation efforts.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, Hezbollah said that its fighters ambushed the
Israeli force attempting to infiltrate out of the
Israeli-occupied border strip.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said two guerrillas were killed, but the
Shiite Muslim organization denied any casualties among its
fighters.
</P>
<P>
The clash has brought the Israeli casualties to nine killed and
40 injured in south Lebanon since this year. Last year, 27 Israeli
soldiers were killed in clashes with Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah spearheads a guerrilla warfare in south Lebanon in a
bid to drive the Israeli forces out of the 1,100-square-kilometer
buffer zone, which the Jewish state established in 1985.
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli official has said that Iran had supplied
large quantities of weapons to Hezbollah during the first quarter
of this year, including some much more sophisticated than those
used by Hezbollah.

International Police Task Force in Bosnia by 120 police personnel
to enable it to carry out additional human rights and training
duties.
</P>
<P>
The council urged member states to provide qualified police
monitors and other forms of assistance and support to the
International Police Task Force.
</P>
<P>
By taking the move, the council gave all the additional police
force requested by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
In a March report, Annan suggested that the U.N. position more
police in the northwestern Bosnian city of Brcko, which according
to an arbitration award will remain under international control
for another year.
</P>
<P>
He also said a substantial number of police experts were needed
on human rights investigation, monitoring of the local police,
strengthening of police training, police restructuring and the
development of guidelines for democratic policing.
</P>
<P>
At the end of March, the council approved an earlier increase
of 186 additional police and 11 civilians for Brcko.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. police task force was set up in December, 1995
together with the 31,000-strong NATO-led Stabilization Force.

KUWAIT CITY, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has announced that its
state leader will stop boycotting future Arab summit attended by
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Official Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) today quoted Kuwaiti acting
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad as
saying that "I say Kuwait has no right to ban any conference or
object on that."
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahmad underlined in an interview with Lebanese weekly
Al-Sheraa published today "Kuwait's readiness to participate in an
Arab summit attended by the Iraqi regime's president."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was occupied by Iraqi troops under the order of Saddam
Hussein in 1990 and was declared the 19th province of Iraq for
seven months before it was liberated by an U.S.-led
multi-national coalition force from the occupation in the Gulf
War.
</P>

Since the Gulf War in 1991, Kuwaiti leaders boycott any
occasions of Arabian major political forums or economic functions
with the presence of Saddam Hussein.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official: Direct Talks Likely to Start Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Under-Secretary General for
Political Affairs, Sir Kieran Prendergast, announced here today
that the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities are
willing to go to direct talks on the Cyprus problem..
</P>
<P>
He also said the talks, aiming to resume a process to search
for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem, are likely
to start in Late June or early July.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official made the remarks at a press conference at the
end of his two-day visit to the island, where he had separate
meetings with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that no preconditions are set for this
process by either leader, who are likely to meet first in "a
secluded venue" near New York and continue talks in Europe,
probably Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"I found my contacts with the two leaders to be both valuable
and informative," Sir Kieran said, noting he is in a better
position to report back to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan next
week.
</P>
<P>
Annan will have to take a firm decision at the end of the
month, Sir Kieran explained and pointed out that "the
Secretary-General himself has made it clear that he would like to
see direct talks resume by the middle of this year."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said the aim of renewed direct talks is "a
comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem and we at the
U.N. will do our very best to promote such an outcome, but
ultimately success depends on the willingness of the two sides to
show flexibility and willingness to compromise."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.N. considered that now it was closer to
progress, Sir Kieran replied "if we did not think there was a
chance of progress, we would not issue an invitation."
</P>
<P>
He also said key players in the Cyprus problem, including the
European Union, Greece, Turkey and Britain as well as the U.S.,
will be in the wings for consultations, if need be.
</P>
<P>
Sir Kieran will leave Sunday for Athens for talks with Greek
officials, and then fly on to Ankara for meetings Tuesday with
Turkish government officials.

<P>
LAGOS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- West African Leaders are scheduled
to meet in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, next week to review the
implementation of the ongoing peace plan for Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The one-day summit of the Committee of Nine on Liberia of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is expected to
decide a new date for the election and the swearing-in of a new
government as widely anticipated.
</P>
<P>
"The summit was necessitated by indications that planned
elections for that country might have to be rescheduled," the
News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
A two-day ministerial meeting will be held before the summit,
which is scheduled for next Wednesday and also expected to agree

Under the ECOWAS-brokered AbujaA peace plan signed last
August, Liberia's legislative and presidential elections are
scheduled for May 30, with the new government to swear-in on June
15.
</P>
<P>
However, some people complained about the insecurity in some
areas of the country, the absence of logistics, voter education
program, and the domination of the government by appointees of
former warlords.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigeria News Agency, a delegation, representing
the political interests in Liberia, is already in Nigeria for
preparatory talks with Nigerian head of state General Sani
Abacha, who is the Chairman of ECOWAS.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Apologizes to Tuskegee Experiment Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday apologized to black men whose syphilis went untreated by
government doctors.
</P>
<P>
In an address at a White House ceremony, Clinton said, the
victims were "betrayed," and "Their lives were trampled upon."
</P>
<P>
With aged victims of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study conducted
between the 1930s and 1972 seated in the East Room, the president
said, "What was done cannot be undone but we can end the silence."
</P>
<P>
"We can look at you in the eyes and finally say on behalf of
the American people: What the government did was shameful and I am
sorry," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the president, Herman Shaw, a victim of the study
said, "We were treated unfairly -- to some extend like guinea pigs."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We were not pigs. We were not dancing boys."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also announced an effort today to encourage more blacks
to pursue careers in bioethics and medical research.
</P>
<P>
He promised a 200,000-dollar planning grant to allow Tuskegee
University to pursue building a Center for Bioethics in Research
and Health Care. The White House said the center would serve as a
"lasting memorial" that would "address the legacy of the syphilis
study."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also announced the creation of bioethics fellowships
for minority students, offered by the Department of Health and
Human Services. He directed HHS Secretary Donna Shalala to draft a
report within 180 days outlining ways to better involve all
communities, especially minority communities, in research and
health care.
</P>
<P>
The president also has planned a major initiative on race,
starting with a June 14 speech at the University of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Clinton told Shaw, Carter Howard, 93; Charlie Pollard,
91; Herman Shaw, 94; and Fred Simmons, 100, that the United States
is officially sorry that it let them suffer so unfairly for so
long during the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.
</P>
<P>
Other survivors and their families, unable to make the trip,
watched the ceremony via satellite from the campus of Tuskegee
University.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the 1930s, 399 men signed up with the U.S. Public
Health Service for free medical care. The service was conducting a
study on the effects of syphilis on the human body and, at the
time, the sexually transmitted disease was rampant in Macon
County, Alabama.
</P>
<P>
But the men were never told they had syphilis. They were told
they had "bad blood" and were denied access to treatment, even for
years after penicillin came into use in 1947.
</P>
<P>
By 1972, 28 men had died of syphilis, 100 others were dead of
related complications, at least 40 wives had been infected and 19
children had contracted the disease at birth.
</P>
<P>
The government has never actually admitted wrongdoing, though
it has distributed about 10 million dollars to more than 6,000
survivors and their family members after settling a 1973
class-action lawsuit.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Croatian Foreign
Minister Mate Granic today defended his country against criticism
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Granic said he was mystified by
the comments of State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns that the
Croatian leader's meeting Thursday with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright revealed broad disagreement between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Burns said, "I can't remember a tougher meeting in
a long time that the secrtary's had with a visiting foreign
minister."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, featured as a "vigorous discussion back and
forth", Albright made it "crystal clear" to Granic that Croatia
cannot be treated as a friend so long as it does not abide by the
Dayton peace agreement, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Disagreeing with Burns' comment, Granic told reporters,
however, there was agreement on more than 90 percent of the issues
discussed, and he was satisfied with the meeting.
</P>
<P>
As for Burns' allegation of mistreatment of the minority
Serbian population in Croatia, Granic said Croatia is doing all it
can to ensure that all displaced people can return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that Serb-Croat mistrust continues to run
deep in Croatia.

<HEADLINE> US Disappointed With Mideast Peace Stagnation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States, disappointed
with the stalled Middle East peace process, today called on
Israelis and Palestinians to re-open their negotiations so that
the peace process could be pulled back on track.
</P>
<P>
Before her talks with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters, "There
continues to be a need to bring the parties together in a
constructive dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told
reporters at a briefing that the peace process between the
Palestinians and Israel had "not moved forward for months."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Minister Levy and Secretary Albright discussed at
some length the efforts by the United States, Israel and the
Palestinians to revive the peace negotiations."
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross, who arrived in the Middle East
early this month in an attempt to bring the Palestinians and
Israelis back to the negotiating table, has failed in doing his
mission and will return to Washington to report to the president
and the secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
Ross was said to be snubbed by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, who said in a letter to President Bill Clinton that he was
disappointed with Ross's mission.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian officials said Ross had not been pushing
Israel hard enough to comply with the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians negotiators have said they would not resume peace
talks and security cooperation, suspended two months ago, unless
Israel stopped construction of Jewish neighborhood in Arab east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian negotiators were surprised when Ross kept
silent at Israeli officials' remarks during a high-level meeting
between the two sides that they would continue building Jewish
settlements both in east Jerusalem and on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Albright also will discuss with Levy on upgrading aid to Jordan
as a sort of reward for King Hussein who managed to bring Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Arafat
together to sign an agreement on Hebron early this year.
</P>
<P>
One option under consideration is to shift some of the 3
billion dollars Israel gets annually to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Levy said more aid to Jordan was an important link to the peace
process and "we will find a common way to achieve that goal."
</P>
<P>
Albright said, "We are now examining with the Israelis details
on how best to move forward on this, and when we reach a
conclusion on this, we'll be consulting with Congress."

<HEADLINE> UN Reforms to Yield 100 Mln Dlr Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Managerial reform in the
United Nations would yield savings of 100 million dollars this
year, or 7.7 percent of its annual regular budget, and improve the
world body's effectiveness, a top UN official said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his introduction to the report at the Fifth Committee
(Administrative and Budgetary) this morning,
Under-Secretary-General Joseph E. Connor said that reform efforts
were laying the groundwork for "keeping within a `no growth'
budget, living with reduced staff levels and for future savings."
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "UN 21: Accelerating Managerial Reform for
Results," laid out key goals designed to accelerate and integrate
managerial reform, streamline administration; modernize and
enhance information services; and align responsibility and
accountability.
</P>
<P>
As part of the reform efforts to streamline administration,
some offices had already achieved required budget reductions for
1996-1997 and laid the basis for 1998-1999 savings through
enhanced efficiency, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The efforts to modernize and enhance information services
included those that had made the UN home page a top-rated Internet
site, consulted more than a million times a week as of February,
up from about 200,000 a week in last June. The home page and other
electronic publications had put the organization on track to
achieve 25 percent reduction in the volume of paper documents by
1998 while improving its capacity to service member states.
</P>
<P>
Conner said that by the end of June, every mission in New York
would be connected to the UN home page and to all UN documents on
the Optical Disk System via the Internet. By the end of the year,
every mission in Geneva and Vienna would be connected.
</P>
<P>
The reforms had delivered results which included savings of at
least 30 million dollars in regular and extrabudgetary efficiency
savings last year and about 100 million dollars expected savings
this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The UN's current annual regular budget stands at 1.3 billion
dollars.

PARIS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Zaire's ousted president Mobutu Sese
Seko might seek exile in France after brief stays in Morocco and
Liechtenstein, Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted a reliable source
in the Moroccan capital Rabat as saying today.
</P>
<P>
But the statement made hours ago by the the country's new
self-appointed leader, Laurent Kabila that Mobutu can stay in
Gbadolite, northern Zaire, could change the "information on the
problem," AFP quoted the unidentified diplomat in Rabat as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu will stay in Morocco anything from several hours to a
few days, because he cannot immediately go to France, which is at
the height of its legislative election campaign, said the source.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said he had no indications
of whether Mobutu, who ruled Zaire for 32 years, might seek exile
in France.
</P>
<P>
An American diplomat in Rabat said today that Mobutu would
arrive "within hours" in Morocco, which has prepared a villa for
him in a residential district of Rabat.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted an African diplomat in Rabat as saying that "an
advisor for the military security" of Mobutu and several of his
relatives would be in Rabat today.
</P>
<P>
Morocco has officially neither denied nor confirmed the reports.
</P>
<P>
The forces of Laurent Kabila's Alliance of Democratic
Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) today entered
Kinshasa after an eight-month rebellion against the government.
</P>
<P>
Kabila also declared himself the new head of state of Zaire and
said the country would now be known as the Democratic Republic of
Congo, the former name of Zaire scrapped by Mobutu in 1971.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM, EU Envoy Review Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
and European Union Mideast Envoy Miguel Moratinos today reviewed
the latest developments on the Palestinian-Israeli track, after
the latest U.S. efforts failed to restore the peace momentum.
</P>
<P>
In statements to reporters following the meeting, Moratinos
said the peace process has to be rescued and the EU will exert
all efforts via diplomatic channels to this end.
</P>
<P>
Carrying a message from Cairo that the peace process is in the
most critical stage since Madrid, the EU envoy said he will head
Sunday to Gaza then Israel and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is important to activate the role of
Russia as a co-sponsor of the peace process at such a critical
stage.
</P>
<P>
It is possible that he will return to Cairo after calling an
emergency meeting of senior European officials next week, to take
the right decision on following steps.
</P>
<P>
"There is no time left to waste and it is necessary to get out
of such serious situation," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
As for the role that could be played by the European side
after the failure of the mission of U.S. Peace Coordinator Dennis
Ross, Moratinos said the European stance and the U.S. role are
not contradictory.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the EU is "deeply concerned over the
impasse of the peace drive, especially on the Palestinian track."
</P>
<P>
He said his meeting with Moussa today was a good opportunity
to directly expound issues and suggest ideas.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos arrived here Friday, a day after Ross returned home
empty-handed after a renewed shuttle diplomacy between Israeli
and Palestinian leaders in a bid to breathe new life to the peace
talks stalled since Israel broke ground for a new Jewish
settlement in East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
The nine-day American mediation failed as Israel rejected a
call for the halt of the construction. The Palestinians
reportedly accused Ross of siding with Israel on the settlement
issue.
</P>
<P>
Amid signs of escalating crisis, President of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat has demanded personal
involvement of U.S. President Bill Clinton to save the peace
process, according to the state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called on the U.S. to play a more active role in its
mediation efforts, while meeting with Ross in the West Bank city
of Nablus Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Ross had met with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai as well as the EU envoy.

BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The latest statistics show that
some poor areas in China have received over 2.6 billion yuan
(about 320 million US dollars) to support a project to bring them
nine-year compulsory education during the past two years.

Hebei and Shanxi, central China's Henan, northwest China's Shaanxi
and northeast China's Heilongjiang, signed an agreement with the
SEC and the Ministry of Finance to enhance the education project.
</P>
<P>
Soon after that, 383 counties in the 12 provinces started to
carry out the project. According to the agreement, the 12
provinces will receive and allocate 5.3 billion yuan of project
funds by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics provided by the 383 counties, the
enrollment rate for school-age children increased to 98.7 percent
in 1996 from 1994's 97.27 percent. The dropout rate among primary
school students dropped to 1.16 percent last year from 1.81
percent in 1994. The enrollment rate at junior middle schools
reached 85.3 percent last year from 77.73 percent. The dropout
rate decreased to 2.71 percent in 1996 from 4.53 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It is planned that by the year 2000 the central government will
allocate 3.9 billion yuan to support compulsory education in some
590 poor counties designated by central and provincial
governments. Meanwhile, local governments are urged to allocate
twice as much as the central government does to aid education.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the project is expected to be supplied with nearly
12 billion yuan by the year 2000, making it the largest
educational project launched by the Chinese government since 1949.
</P>
<P>
The project will shift its focus to nine poor provinces and
autonomous regions in the western part of the country from next
year, including the Inner Mongolia and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous
regions, and Yunnan and Guizhou provinces.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nigeria's New Rows With Britain, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Yongkang)
</P>
<P>
LAGOS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's strained relations with
Britain and the U.S. received a further blow in the last few
days, following Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Ghaddafi's visit to
the west African country.
</P>
<P>
While Colonel Ghaddafi was still in Niamey of Niger, the U.S.
had reportedly made a request to the Nigerian government to
detain Ghaddafi's plane for violating the United Nations' air
embargo.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government regarded this as interference of its
internal affairs, because Ghaddafi's visit was arranged at its
invitation.
</P>
<P>
When Ghaddafi arrived in Kano Airport in northern Nigeria on
May 9 aboard a Libyan Airlines plane, escorted by seven other
Libyan planes, he was given everything that a head of state
deserves at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Ghaddafi was also greeted by thousands of Nigerian Muslims on
his way to the Kano State Government House, for he had come to
celebrate the Muslim New Year and many Muslims are said to be
sympathetic to him, regarding him as a victim of U.S. policies.
</P>
<P>
After condemning U.S. policy of producing instability in
Islamic countries at a rally and holding talks with Nigerian head
of state, General Sani Abacha, Ghaddafi got on board his plane in
the company of Abacha and flew to the Nigerian capital, Abuja.
</P>
<P>
There, he was given a grand state banquet and was even honored
with the Grand Commander of the Federal Republic, one of the
highest national honors of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was apparently angered by this move. It condemned
Ghaddafi's trip and persuaded the United Nations Sanctions
Committee into a probe into the roles of Niger and Nigeria in the
event.
</P>
<P>
The situation on the British front is even worse.
</P>
<P>
On May 12, Britain's new Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, while
explaining the Labor government's foreign policy, announced that
the new government will retain the sanctions imposed on Nigeria
by the Conservative government since 1993.
</P>
<P>
"There should be tough economic sanctions on a regime which is
among the most brutal in the world," he allegedly said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's anger and disappointment to this is apparent. It
should be recalled that not long before, General Abacha had sent
a congratulatory message to Tony Blair for his party's victory in
the British elections.
</P>
<P>
The final showdown between Nigeria and Britain seemed to be
imminent on Friday, when the British government informed Nigeria
early that day of its decision to ban Nigerian planes from flying
to London.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had already done the same in November 1993, following
the annulment of the June 12 presidential elections by the then
Babangida government of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria reponded quickly. On Friday afternoon, the British
Airways in Lagos was informed by the Ministry of Aviation of its
decision to stop the airlines and all British registered planes
from flying to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Though there are worries of Nigeria's "showdown with the
west", analysts here believe that nothing serious will come out
of the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Aderemi Oyewumi of the Nigerian Institute of International
Affairs admitted that Nigeria's warm reception for one of
America's "greatest enemy" will have a negative effect on its
relations with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
But he said nothing serious may come of the UN Sanctions
Committee and the Security Council other than mere condemnations.
</P>
<P>
"There is no much they can do to Ghaddafi and even Nigeria,"
he said, "Many African countries are against the U.N. resolution
on Libya and believe that Libya has been singled out for
victimization by the west."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Not to Alter Under Pressures, Says Abacha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will only do business with
countries that respect its sovereignty and relate to it on the
basis of equality, head of state General Sani Abacha has said.
</P>
<P>
The federal government will not be altered through external
pressures from its set course to which it is irredeemably
committed, Abacha was quoted by the local paper "Guardian" today
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The countries with which Nigeria would do business must stand
by it and fulfill all their promises, Abacha added.
</P>
<P>
These are the highlights of an address by the head of state at
the launching of 1,500 specialized vehicles for the use of the
armed forces and police on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The troop and personnel carriers, supplied by the Tata
Engineering and Locomotive Company Ltd of India, will enable the
armed forces and police to be well equipped to play greater
regional peacekeeping roles, Abacha said.
</P>
<P>
"With regional conflicts in Africa increasingly becoming
purely African affairs, the Nigerian Araed forces and police will
have a greater role to play in regional peacekeeping," he said.

NAIROBI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Education Minister Joseph
Kamotho said that his government is concerned with the

<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Donors to Bangladesh are expected to
fix a strategy for future lending to the country's energy sector
at a four-day meeting beginning here on May 19, said an official
of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) resident mission.
</P>
<P>
The ADB, the biggest lending agency in the energy sector of
Bangladesh, will coordinate the meeting to be attended by the
major donors including the World Bank (WB), Germany, the United
Kingdom, Japan and Norway which have invested in Bangladesh's
energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The ADB official said the basic objectives of the meeting are
to review the energy sector's performance, the status of the
ongoing projects and progress of sector reforms and fixing a
strategy for future lending to the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Two sessions of the meeting will take place between Bangladesh
and the donors while the others will be held among the donors.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources Nooruddin Khan is
expected to preside over a session on the first day between
Bangladesh and the donors. Bangladesh will present two papers
respectively on the gas and power sector at the meeting.

<P>
The ADB has already prepared a review report on the basis of
the said objectives and the report will be submitted to the
meeting, said the official.

The donors' lending to the energy sector may increase in view
of the congenial investment climate created following the
initiative of subregional cooperation made by Bangladesh, India,
Nepal and Bhutan, the official added.

At present, the contributions of the two major donor agencies,
the World Bank and the ADB, to Bangladesh's energy sector stand at

GLASGOW, Scotland, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian shuttlers
have a 45 percent chance to win the Sudirman Cup world mixed team
championship, Indonesian head coach Indra Gunawan said here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But he said Denmark could be the biggest obstacle his team has
to surmount in group matches.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese team is of course the strongest. But we are good
as well," Indra Gunawan told Xinhua. "To tell the truth, we have
45 percent and the Chinese have the other 55 percent chance."
</P>
<P>
He said men's singles world champion Heryanto Arbi shook off
his injuries and is now 100 percent fit while Joko Suprianto has
recovered from a thigh injury that he suffered in World Grand Prix

CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) will keep unchanged
the interest rates on Jordanian dinar and the dinar-dollar
exchange rate, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates in Jordan had no relation to those in the
United states and the fixed exchange rate had been in force for
the past two years and there is no intention to change it, said
Walid Khairallah, the CBJ deputy governor.
</P>
<P>
The CBJ made the declaration against rumors that the bank
increased the interest rates on dinars over the past few months
to give the dinar holders better advantage over those who held
U.S. dollar deposits and the fixed dollar-dinar exchange rate was
to be changed in response to the higher value of the dollar on
international markets.
</P>
<P>
In Jordan's banks, the interest rates of fixed dinar deposit
are a few points higher than that of dollars.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) will in the coming
four to five months offer Jordanian government bonds worth 70
million U.S. dollars to potential investors on the world markets,
according to Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
The decision is aimed at helping the country reach a level of
self-sustenance, when it will no longer be in need of support to
finance its balance of payment deficit, said CBJ Deputy Governor
Michael Marto.
</P>
<P>
Marto made the remarks at an investment seminar organized by a
Swiss Bank in London to help Jordan attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan and Germany have signed a 102 million DM
(about 61 million U.S. dollars) protocol slated to cover debt
alleviation, soft loans and grants to be used in water projects
and poverty eradication programs, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Among the amount, 50 million DM (about 30 million dollars) is
German's allocation for Jordan in 1997, 12 million DM (about 7
million dollars) for technical assistance and 40 million DM
(about 24 million dollars) for relieving the country's debt to
Germany, according to the protocol signed here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the third largest aid contributor to Jordan after
the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian government would provide all lands for
Egyptian, Arab and foreign investors in the southern Nile Valley
area for reclamation and establishment of investment ventures,
the Arabic newspaper Akhbar El Yom today quoted Minister of
Cabinet Affairs Talaat Hamaad as saying.
</P>

Hammad said that these ventures would enjoy all incentives and
privileges foremost among which is a 20-year tax holiday.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Declares Himself Head of Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The 32-year rule of Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko came to an end today as Zaire's capital
fell to the forces led by Laurent-Desire Kabila, who declared
himself the head of state of ``the Democratic Republic of Congo.''
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who heads the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of Congo-Zaire, declared himself head of state at a
press conference in the southern city of Lubumbashi this morning.
</P>
<P>
He also declared that the country would no longer be called
Zaire -- the name Mobutu gave it in 1971 -- but would be known as
the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Congo was the name used by the country after independence in
1960 and before Mobutu took power.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's announcement came after an eight-month battle across
the country to defeat government troops and oust Mobutu, his rival
for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's soldiers were seen to be moving close to the center of
Kinshasa, while unarmed government soldiers, disguised as
civilians and carrying sacks on their shoulders, were fleeing the
city.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between government troops and Kabila's forces
continued from Friday until this morning around Kinshasa's
international airport, 25 kilometers north of the city, and
government forces looted the center of the capital this morning.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's troops had ordered government soldiers to lay down their
arms before 11:00 (10:00 GMT), and there was panic at their
headquarters as officers prepared to flee.
</P>
<P>
The streets were deserted, and many young people stood at the
doors of their houses anticipating the arrival of the rebels with
a look of indifference on their faces.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources reached by telephone, Prime
Minister General Likoulia Bolongo has fled to neighboring
Congo, while Defense Minister General Mahele Liyoko was killed by
soldiers early this morning at an army camp.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu fled the city on Friday for his jungle palace in his
home region of Gbadolite and is expected to seek asylum in
Morocco, where he owns a residence.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Stunt Driver to Leap Hukou Waterfall as Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Daredevil Ke Shouliang reaffirmed
here Friday that his attempt to jump across the Hukou Waterfall in
a stunt car will go ahead as scheduled on June 1.
</P>
<P>
He said he would do his last test run by jumping across a 50-m
gap -- the width of the waterfall -- next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ke's family will be there June 1 to witness his attempt, Ke
said in this capital of north China's Shanxi Province Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old stuntman hopes that this will mark a
triumphant end to his dangerous career.
</P>
<P>
The waterfall lies on the border between Shanxi and Shaanxi
provinces, with a drop of over 30 m.
</P>
<P>
Ke will drive his car along a ramp 264 m long and 10 m wide on
the Shanxi side and launch it into the air over the waterfall.
</P>
<P>
He hopes to land on a platform 50 m long and 10 m wide on the
Shaanxi side, which will be cushioned with cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the China Central Television Station will carry a
four-hour live telecast of the event, and the Phoenix Television
Station of Hong Kong will broadcast the event live overseas.
</P>
<P>
Ke failed in his first test run in March, but jumped 42 m
during the second test run in early April.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 he drove a motorcycle across the Jinshanling Section of
the Great Wall in north China's Hebei Province.

<HEADLINE> PLC Reads Bill on Provisional Regional Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Regional Council (Amendment)
Bill 1997 was tabled here today by the Chief Executive's Office of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) for the first and second
readings.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seventh PLC plenary meeting, Michael Suen,
secretary for policy coordination of the Chief Executive's Office,
outlined the main contents of the draft bill:
</P>
<P>
-- The rights, duties, obligations and liabilities of the
existing Regional Council, which is to stop functioning on June
30, 1997, will be assigned to the Provisional Regional Council so
as to achieve a seamless transition.
</P>
<P>
-- The Provisional Regional Council consists of not more than
50 members, a 25 percent increase compared with the existing
Regional Council. The members will be appointed by the Chief
Executive with their terms of office running not later than
December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
-- A person appointed does not become a member and cannot
undertake any function as a member until he is sworn in.
</P>
<P>
-- The first meeting of the Provisional Regional Council will
be arranged before July 7, 1997, to elect a chairman and a
vice-chairman of the body.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Council is responsible for all matters concerning
environmental hygiene, public health, sanitation and the provision
of recreation, sports and cultural facilities and services to the
residents living in the New Territories.
</P>
<P>
According to Suen, the proposed Provisional Regional Council
will operate along with the establishment of the HKSAR in place of
the existing Regional Council .
</P>
<P>
Considering that the tenure of office of the existing Regional
Council ends on June 30, 1997 and that members of the first
Regional Council of the HKSAR can not be elected before July 1,
1997, it is necessary to set up the Provisional Regional Council
so as to fill a vacuum and guarantee an effective operation of the
HKSAR, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The District Boards (Amendment)
Bill 1997, which concerns the formation of 18 Provisional District
Boards throughout Hong Kong, was tabled here today to the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) for first and second
readings.
</P>
<P>
Michael Suen, secretary for policy coordination of the Chief
Executive's Office of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), explained the main contents of the draft bill at a PLC
plenary meeting:
</P>
<P>
-- Each Provisional District Board consists of not more than 40
members, a 25-percent increase over the existing District
Board. The members will be appointed by the chief executive with
their terms of office running not later than December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
-- A person appointed does not become a member and cannot
undertake any function as a member until he is sworn in.
</P>
<P>
-- The first meeting of the Provisional District Boards will be
arranged before July 7, 1997, to elect a chairman for each of the
boards.
</P>
<P>
The District Boards have a mainly advisory role with
substantial responsibility for the management of district affairs
and they provide a forum for public consultation and participation
at the district level.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the District Boards (Amendment) Bill 1997, two
other bills concerning the formation of provisional regional and
district organizations, the Urban Council (Amendment) Bill 1997
and the Regional Council (Amendment) Bill 1997, were also
introduced to today's meeting for first and second readings.
</P>
<P>
The existing 18 District Boards in Hong Kong, set up and formed
in accordance with the District Board Ordinance, will stop
functioning on June 30, 1997, in line with a resolution by the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, Suen
said.
</P>
<P>
As members of the first District Boards can not be elected
before July 1, 1997, Provisional District Boards must be formed
along with the establishment of the HKSAR so as to avoid a vacuum
and guarantee the effective operation of the HKSAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Laurent-Desire Kabila today declared
himself the country's new head of state, suspended the
constitution and said he would form a government of "national
salvation" within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who heads the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of Congo-Zaire, said that the generals of the Zairean
government forces had pledged loyalty to him and ordered their
soldiers to surrender.
</P>
<P>
He said a parliament would be put into place within two months
and asked state employees in Kinshasa, which fell to his forces
today, to stay in their posts.
</P>
<P>
The new government would honor international obligations as
long as they conformed with the country's national interests.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Zaire's second largest city
Lubumbashi, his power base in the south, Kabila also announced the
country would be revert to the name Congo, used after independence
in 1960, and would now be known as the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
President Mobutu Sese Seko, who has ruled the country for 32
years, named the country Zaire in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who led the AFDL during its eight-month armed campaign
against Mobutu's government, said the leaders of the rebellion had
decided that he should assume from today the functions of chief of
the Congolese state.''
</P>
<P>
He said that Mobutu, who fled Kinshasa on Friday to his
stronghold of Gbadolite in northern Zaire, could remain in the
village. Mobutu, though, is expected to go into exile in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Kabila would travel to Kinshasa "very soon".

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebels Enter Capital Kinshasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Small groups of Zairean rebels
have today entered the suburbs of the Zairean capital Kinshasa
and the residents flocked onto the streets to welcome them.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here this afternoon quoted witnesses as
saying that senior government army officers and soldiers handed
over weapons to the arriving rebels at Salongo Nord camp in the
suburbs of Lemba.
</P>
<P>
Laurent Kabila, leader of the rebel Alliance of Democratic
Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, said earlier today
that he had taken over power as head of state with an agreement
of the government generals in the capital and expected his men
would enter into the capital in hours.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said in a nine-point statement read in French that he
and his forces were stepping in to fill the power vacuum left on
Frieday when Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko fled Kinshasa,
and to save the country from destruction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zairean Prime Minister Gen. Likulia Bolongo
called on all the fighting army units to return to their barracks
and urging Kinshasa civilians to stay at their home.
</P>
<P>
"All combat units should return to barracks," Bolongo said.
</P>
<P>
To avert clashes, he also called on the advancing rebel
forces to hold their positions and pledged to continue a
mediating role and to try to ensure peace.
</P>
<P>
Zairean President Mobutu fled the capital yesterday for his
stronghold at Gbadolite on the border between Zaire and the
Central African Republic. Analysts say he was on his way to
exile. enditem

<HEADLINE> Urban Council (Amendment) Bill Tabled to PLC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Urban Council (Amendment) Bill
1997 was submitted to the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) here today
for first and second readings.
</P>
<P>
Michael Suen, secretary for policy coordination of the Chief
Executive's Office of the HKSAR, outlined the background for
drafting the bill and two other bills -- the Regional Council
(Amendment) Bill 1997 and the District Boards (Amendment) Bill
1997 -- at the seventh PLC plenary meeting.
</P>
<P>
The existing Urban Council, Regional Council and 18 District
Boards in Hong Kong were set up and formed in accordance with the
Urban Council Ordinance, the Regional Council Ordinance and the
District Board Ordinance respectively, Suen said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a resolution adopted by the Standing Committee of
China's National People's Congress (NPC) on August 31, 1994,
ruled that these regional and district organizations, the last
under British rule, will stop functioning on June 30, 1997, and
that the rights and duties and formation of the regional and
district organizations of the HKSAR will be stipulated by HKSAR
laws.
</P>
<P>
Suen said that on February 23, 1997, the Chinese legislature
decided that articles concerning election in the Urban Council
Ordinance, the Regional Council Ordinance and the District Board
Ordinance will not be adopted as HKSAR laws due to the fact that
they run against the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the tenure of the current Urban Council, Regional
Council and District Boards will end on June 30, 1997, and that
members of the first regional and district organizations of the
HKSAR can not be elected before July 1, 1997. Therefore, it is
necessary to set up provisional regional and district
organizations, namely, the Provisional Urban Council, the
Provisional Regional Council and 18 Provisional District Boards,
upon the establishment of the HKSAR so as to fill the vacuum and
guarantee the effective operation of the HKSAR, he said.
</P>
<P>
Suen summarized the main contents of the Urban Council
(Amendment) Ordinance 1997:
</P>
<P>
-- The rights, duties, obligations and liabilities of the
existing Urban Council will be assigned to the Provisional Urban
Council so as to achieve a smooth transition. The Urban Council is
responsible for matters concerning public health, sanitation and
hygiene, the provision of recreational, sports and cultural
facilities and activities in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
-- The Provisional Urban Council consists of not more than 50
members, a 25-percent increase over the existing Urban
Council. The members will be appointed by the chief executive with
their terms of office running not later than December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
-- A person appointed does not become a member and cannot
undertake any function as a member until he is sworn in.
</P>
<P>
-- The first meeting of the Provisional Urban Council will be
arranged before July 7, 1997, to elect a chairman and a
vice-chairman for the body.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Minister Pledges to Cut Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia Defense Minister Igor Rodionov
pledged today to cut the number of Russian troops, including those
stationed in four Russian-held islands claimed by Japan, Kyodo
News reported.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov made the promise during a meeting with Japanese
Defense Agency chief Fumio Kyuma at the Defense Agency, Kyodo
quoted agency officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov, who arrived in Japan on Friday for a three-day visit,
is the first defense minister ever to visit Japan from Russia or
its predecessor, the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Russia has already cut its military personnel by 1.5 million
and plans to reduce numbers by another 200,000 this year, Rodionov
was quoted as telling Kyuma.
</P>
<P>
Defense Agency officials did not say whether Rodionov gave any
specific figures about the size of troops reductions on what Japan
calls its "northern Territories" which includes four islands
seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,500 Russian troops are stationed on the Japanese claimed
islands, according to Japanese Defense Agency.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Rodionov also briefed Kyuma on Russia's
overall defense policy, saying "we reject the use of force against
any country as a way to attain a political target."
</P>
<P>
Rodionov and Kyuma agreed to promote bilateral defense dialogue
and cooperation so as to contribute to peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region, Japanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
The two defense heads also reaffirmed that the first postwar
visit by a Russian Navy ship to Tokyo would take place in late
June, as well as a joint naval drill to prevent naval accidents
and regular bilateral defense meetings at director and vice
ministerial levels.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov conveyed a personal message from President Boris
Yeltsin to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in which the Russian
leader underscored the importance of exchange between top defense
and military officials between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kyuma briefed Rodionov on an ongoing review of guidelines on
Japan-U.S. defense cooperation and assured him that Tokyo will
explain the new guidelines to Russia, and to other neighboring
countries such as China and South Korea, when they are drafted,
Kyodo said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Multimedia Corridor Gets Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Multimedia Super
Corridor (MSC) project took another giant step today when
Cyberjaya, its nucleus, was officially launched, marking the start
of the "physical" construction of the MSC.
</P>
<P>
Cyberjaya, Malaysia's first smart city on a 2,800-hectare site,
is located next to Putrajaya, the federal government's new
intelligent administrative capital on a 7,000-hectare site, and is
separated from Putrajaya by a highway to be named Route 2020.
</P>
<P>
The physical development of Cyberjaya will initially involve
3.5 billion ringgit (about 1.4 billion U.S. dollars) and the cost
will be borne by Cyberview Private Limited, which came into being
only days ago to speed up the development of Cyberjaya, according
to officials.
</P>
<P>
Cyberview, a joint venture company between the government's
Multimedia Development Corporation (MDC) and five other partners,
plans to complete the first phase of Cyberjaya's development by
next April. The first phase includes the Multimedia University and
the development of the first 750-hectare Flagship zone, the hub of
the smart city, and the remaining area would be developed in
stages up to the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Seven specific sites have been identified for some of the
pioneering projects in the Flagship Zone.
</P>
<P>
Cyberjaya will have a low density population of 35 persons per
hectare and its target population is 240,000 including 10,000
knowledge workers.
</P>
<P>
Cyberjaya, which is to serve as a regional launch site for
companies developing or using leading multimedia technologies,
will be served by the most advanced physical and software
infrastructure including a 2.5 to 10 gigabit per second broadband
network backbone.
</P>
<P>
The smart city is the core component of the MSC, which also
encompasses the Kuala Lumpur City Center, Kuala Lumpur
International Airport and Putrajaya.
</P>
<P>
The MSC, a 15 kilometer by 50 kilometer zone specially designed
for hi-tech development, is the brainchild of the country's Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad who has been successful so far in
inviting the world's top information and multimedia companies to
invest in the corridor since the launch of the MSC last year.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, major promotional efforts undertaken by Mahathir
himself in the United States and Japan not long ago to explain
personally to potential companies Malaysia's plan to build the
corridor have yielded very good results.
</P>
<P>
His another promotional visit has been planned for next Tuesday
to Europe to meet potential investors there.
</P>
<P>
The MSC continues to receive overwhelming response from
companies with some 900 already having submitted applications to
the MDC for MSC status.
</P>
<P>
A total of 39 companies, both local and foreign, have already
committed to locating their operations in Cyberjaya.
</P>
<P>
Based on the high level of interest generated and positive
feedback received over the past few months, the Malaysian
government is confident that many other companies would soon
follow the lead.
</P>
<P>
MDC Executive Chairman Othman Yeop Abdullah said the qualifying
criteria for MSC status are that the companies must be heavy users
or providers of multimedia/IT products and services with an
intention to transfer technology and employ at least 15 percent
knowledge workers out of the total number of its workforce.
</P>
<P>
Othman said operational conditions to get MSC status include a
separate legal entity for multimedia businesses and activities, a
business location in a designated cybercity and adherence to
environmental guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The successful creation of Malaysia's MSC is expected to have
50 world-class companies at first and 250 companies in the second
stage when the MSC would be linked to nationwide cybercities.
</P>
<P>
The MDC chief said that by the year 2020, the whole country is
projected to be included as an MSC with the participation of at
least 500 world-class IT companies.
</P>
<P>
To protect the investors' interests, a number of cyber laws are
being drawn up with the parliament having already approved the
Computer Crime Bill and the Digital Signature Bill.
</P>
<P>
This mega-sized and international undertaking is creating an
entirely new industry, facilitating Malaysia's transition to an
information-age multimedia economy and making the country more of
a cyber-nation of the world.
</P>
<P>
Officiating the launch of Cyberjaya today, Mahathir also called
on all his countrymen to open up their minds to the wide-ranging
possibilities and opportunities available in Cyberjaya.
</P>
<P>
"Advances in multimedia technology will lead to new
applications, spurring the growth of trade and commerce, as well
as the growth of productivity and efficiency in all the sectors,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Special Education Gives Brings Hope to Handicapped Children (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANLING, Guizhou, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen-year-old Li
Enqin is bright: wearing a light yellow coat and taller than all
the other 10 children.
</P>
<P>
Slightly bending her head, Li seems to focus her eyesight
nowhere and keeps playing with the lapels of her coat.
</P>
<P>
The 11 children are all students in Saba Primary School of
Baishui Town, Guanling Buyi and Miao Autonomous County of
southwest China's Guizhou Province. The difference between them
and their classmates lies in that their intelligence quotient (IQ)
is lower than normal people's.
</P>
<P>
An IQ test Li received when she was six years old showed that
her IQ was 48, about half of that a healthy person possesses. Li
was diagnosed as medium obtuse.
</P>
<P>
"Fetch water," said Li quietly when asked what she would like
to do when she grew up. Her answer showed that her teachers'
efforts during the past four years had paid off. Li has changed
her "good-for-nothing" fate by learning some simple labor skills
at school.
</P>
<P>
"Li came to our school in fall, 1991 with nasal drips running
down her nose and tangled hair," recalled Zhang Zhenfu, the head
teacher of Saba Primary School,
</P>
<P>
He added that he and other teachers then did not know how to
teach mentally-retarded children. "It seemed that we teachers were
blind," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and his fellow teachers saw a glimmer of hope three years
ago when a project of "education for children with special needs"
started to be carried out in Guizhou Province. The project was
launched jointly by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
and the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF and the Guizhou Provincial government had allocated over
456,000 yuan (about 55,000 U.S. dollars) for the project. Baishui
Town and three other towns in the Province project beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF project also brought training opportunities to local
teachers including Zhang Zhenfu. Among teachers who teach blind,
deaf or mentally-retarded children, 239 have received trainings at
various levels. Besides, 142 parents of disabled children also
received training.
</P>
<P>
"I've been to Beijing twice to receive national training in
special education," said Zhang, "I've visited special schools for
mentally-retarded children. What I've learned has been very useful
and helped improved the quality of special education at my
school."

"To Guizhou Province, the project means much more than
statistics can show," said Pi Junlin, chief of the Basic Education
Section of the Guizhou Provincial Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
Pi said that more than 13,000 disabled children were at school
in Guizhou last year, over 7,000 of whom were studying in the same
classroom with normal children. The enrollment rate for disabled
children increased to 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
There were only some 1,000 disabled children at school in 1993
before the UNICEF project was started in the province. The
enrollment rate was almost zero -- 0.05 percent, Pi said.
</P>
<P>
Li Enqin, who is now a student of grade five, can correctly
write her own name and do some simple calculations. She can also
cook rice and fry potato slices for her family. In her spare time,
she can also follows her parents in cutting grass on hillsides
and picking up maize.
</P>
<P>
The progress Li has made meets the goal for China's special
education -- to help disabled children study knowledge and learn
some skills, so that they will be able to become involved in
social life on an equal footing with other children.
</P>
<P>
China began to bring disabled children to the classroom of
normal children on a trial basis in the early 1980s. The
traditional arrangement was to open special schools for disabled
children.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with such arrangements, disabled children could
not experience the life of normal healthy children. It was also
difficult for normal children to show care for and sympathy with
the disabled.
</P>
<P>
Moreover,many localities cannot afford special schools. Parents
usually do not expect much out of their disabled children, and
they do not want to pay a considerable amount of money to send the
disabled to special schools.
</P>
<P>
"Things have changed, so that disabled and normal children are
mixed in the same classroom," said Wang Minyang, deputy chief of
the Special Education Section of the State Education Commission
(SEC). And the mixed education has become a "very important" mode
for China's special education, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mixed education, drawing on foreign experiences while giving
consideration to China's specific conditions, has proved to be
successful in some areas across the country, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that over 320,000 disabled children
nationwide were at school in 1996, 25,500 more than in the
previous year. Almost two thirds of them are studying in ordinary
schools.
</P>
<P>
The SEC re-adjusted its policy by promoting mixed education as
the mainstay of special education in its Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The mixed education, however, has encountered some problems.
Teachers' training and the reform of teaching methods are two
major problems, Wang said. China is seeking effective solutions to
these problems by summarizing experiences.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smoking Drive to Be Stepped Up in Transportation Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities in charge of
public health and transportation today urged related departments
to thoroughly implement the regulation banning smoking in public
transportation facilities.
</P>
<P>
The smoking ban covers passenger trains, ships, planes, buses,
subways, taxi cabs, ferry boats, cable cars, and waiting rooms at
railway stations, airports and seaports.
</P>
<P>
The regulation, which has been in effect since May 1, was
jointly promulgated by the ministries of Public Health,
Communications, Railways and Construction, as well as the Civil
Aviation Administration of China and the National Patriotic
Hygiene Campaign Committee (NPHCC).
</P>
<P>
It was the first smoking ban jointly announced by China's
central governmental departments, even though four provinces and
70 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, have
formulated local regulations to prohibit smoking in public places.
</P>
<P>
"It is urgent to step up anti-smoking measures, since smoking
and passive smoking have become a serious public health problem in
China, especially in public transportation facilities," said
Minister of Health Chen Minzhang.
</P>
<P>
"To ban smoking from public places also reflects the level of
social civilization and public morality," Chen, also deputy
director of the NPHCC, told a meeting on promoting the implementation
of the regulation here today.
</P>
<P>
Smoking and passive smoking in public transportation facilities
have resulted in an increasing number of complaints from the
Chinese public.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Ministry of Railways, among
the one billion or so train passengers travelling yearly, about 60
percent are smokers.
</P>
<P>
"Because of limited space inside public transportation
facilities, smoking does more harm not only to smokers but to
those in their vicinity, particularly women and children," Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged related departments to set up full-time organizations
to make regular inspections while seriously punishing violators
of the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the ministries and the CAAC said they are
formulating detailed measures for enforcing the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Publicity activities will also be intensified, the officials
said.

SHANGHAI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
met here today with Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome to Chirac, Xu said that Shanghai,
China's largest industrial city, is keen on increasing exchanges
and cooperation with France.
</P>
<P>
Xu also briefed Chirac on Shanghai's progress in the economy,
urban construction and environmental protection in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Chirac spoke highly of Shanghai's economic achievements, saying
that the city is one of the most vigorous ones in the world, and
that greater changes will take place in Shanghai in the 21st
century, the economic center of China.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today Chirac attended the opening ceremony of a
French hi-tech fair.
</P>
<P>

aviation, telecommunications, energy, chemicals, pharmaceuticals
and environmental protection, will become an important milestone
in the advance of the Franco-Chinese partnership into the next
century.

Although some French businesses have entered the Chinese
market, the scale of French investment in China does not match
the potential of French-Chinese ties, he said, adding that more
French enterprises s=hould come to China.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Lawmakers Read Societies Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) met in South China's Shenzhen city
today for the first and second readings of a package of bills
including the Societies (Amendment) Bill 1997.
</P>
<P>
Michael Suen, secretary for policy co-ordination of the HKSAR
Chief Executive's Office, told the members of the Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) that the revised amendment to the bill
was formulated after the office sought opinions from the public in
the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
In early April, the office issued a consultation document to
solicit opinions and suggestions from the communities on its
proposals on the amendments to the Societies Ordinance and the
Public Order Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were made by the office in line with a resolution
of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress
that major amendments to the two ordinances introduced in 1992 and
1995 shall not be adopted as the laws of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Suen said that in the past three weeks, the office received a
total of 5,507 written submissions.
</P>
<P>
He told the PLC that in accordance with article 16 of the
amendment societies bill "a society which has notified the
Societies Officer as required under the Societies (Amendment)
Ordinance before July 1, 1997, is taken to be a registered
society."
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that this ordinance should come into operation on
July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Societies Officer may, after consultation with the
Secretary for Security, refuse to register or to exempt from
registration a society, if he reasonably believes that the refusal
is necessary in the interests of national security or public
safety, public order or the protection of the rights and freedoms
of others, and or if the society is a political body and has a
connection with a foreign political organization or a political
organization of Taiwan, Suen said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bill clearly defines the terms such as
"national security," "political body," "foreign political
organization," "political organizations of Taiwan" and
"connection."
</P>
<P>
Suen pointed out that "national security" is defined in the law
to refer to "the safeguarding of the territorial integrity and
the independence of the People's Republic of China" while
"political organizations" mean political parties or organizations
whose principal functions are to promote and prepare candidates
for elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that the making of these amendments fully represents
the HKSAR government's determination to fulfill its commitment to
safeguard individual rights and freedoms which Hong Kong currently
enjoys and to maintain social stability in the territory.
</P>
<P>
At an earlier press conference in Hong Kong, Suen said that the
bill amendments are also aimed at "guarding against interference
by foreign political forces in local political activities."

<P>
SHENZHEN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The provisional legislature of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) met here today
for the first and second readings of the Public Order (Amendment)
Bill 1997.
</P>
<P>
Michael Suen, secretary for policy co-ordination of the HKSAR
Chief Executive's Office, told the members of the Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) that the revised amendments to the bill
was formulated on the basis of seeking the opinions from the local

</P>
<P>
The office received a total of 5,507 written submissions on the
amendments, Suen said.
</P>
<P>
According to Suen, the Public Order (Amendment) Bill "aims at
striking a proper balance between civil liberties and social
order."
</P>
<P>
He told the PLC that in accordance with article 6 of the bill
"a public procession" may take place if the Commissioner of
Police is notified of the intention to hold the procession and if
the Commissioner of Police is taken to have issued a notice of no
objection.
</P>
<P>
Article 7 of the bill stipulates that the Commissioner of
Police may object to a public procession being held if he
reasonably believes that the objection is necessary in the
interests of national security or public safety, public order or
the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, Suen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that if the Commissioner of Police does not object to
a public procession being held he shall notify the person, who
gave notice, in writing of his having no objection to it within
the time limit under the amendment bill.

<HEADLINE> Macao Youth Urged to Prepare for Future SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official said here
today that Macao youth should make efforts for a smooth transition
and prepare for the future Macao Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
also urged the youth to take an active part in the transitional
affairs in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering marking the 20th anniversary of the
founding of the Youth Committee of the Macao Chamber of Commerce,
Wang said, "Young people in Macao will experience and witness
China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
December 20, 1999."
</P>
<P>
"They should take it as their responsibility to promote a
smooth transition and to strive for a better future as they are
also the participants of the historic process," he told some 500
people present on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, he said, the youth should study hard and
improve themselves continuously.
</P>
<P>
"Macao needs thousands of professionals in such fields as
economy, culture, technology, law, education and administration in
the upcoming handover of power and the formation and development
of the Macao Special Administrative Region," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the director said the young people should also
play an active role in promoting the Basic Law of Macao, in major
transitional issues like the localization of the civil service and
law and the use of Chinese as an official language and in
maintaining social stability and economic growth in the territory.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's handover on July 1 this year means a "major
encouragement" and serves as a model for the return of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wang quoted China's Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen as saying a preparatory committee will be formed early next
year.
</P>
<P>
Kou Hoi In, director of the Youth Committee of the Macao
Chamber of Commerce, pledged that Macao youth will carry on
patriotism, be united and actively participate in Macao's
transitional affairs.
</P>
<P>
"As Hong Kong is returning soon and Macao will return in 945
days," he said, "Macao youth will carry on patriotism and embrace
their historical destiny, meet the challenge of the time and make
greater efforts for the reunification of the motherland and
Macao's smooth handover of power."

<P>
PUSAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea had the biggest share by
taking 11 out of 32 gold medals at stake while Hong Kong obtained its
first gold medal on Saturday at the second Pusan East Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
However, the host remained in the third overall spot with 34 golds,
next to China with 50 and Japan with 40 as the latters secured six
more gold medals apiece.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan also strode forth with eight more gold medals on the day
by collecting seven out of 12 in the boxing competitions, keeping its
fourth place with 23 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
The host had a clean sweep of four golds in taekwondo, and pocketed
other four from the boxing rings, two from judo and one from the
athletics competitions.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong opened its gold account through Ng Siu-ching who scored
the most of 9.530 points in the women's Nanquan finals.
</P>
<P>
With all Asian marks remain intact on the day, Chinese Huang Geng,
Asian record holder in the men's long jump, failed miserably with his
best jump of 8.03 for the second place, a far cry from his Asian mark
of 8.38 meters set in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"But I still felt satisfied with the jumps today because I was
walking down the slope off my peak," said Huang who leapt to 8.33
meters in the Japanese invitational meets days before the East Asian
Games.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's seven-gold hunting spree in the boxing rings was
initiated by Boulat Djoumadilov in the 51-kg fly weight finals, and
wounded up by Serik Umirbekov in the over 91-kg super heavy category.
</P>
<P>
The other five golds for Kazakhstan were through Bolat Niazymbetov,
Nourjan Smanov, Ermakhan Ibratmov, Yermek Nyssanov and Roustam
Toursenkanov in the 63.5kg, 67kg, 71kg, 75kg and 81kg categories.
</P>
<P>
South Korea got the first boxing title through Choi Jun-wook in the
48-kg light fly category by outbeating Chinese Yang Xiangzhong and had
three more through Choi Seung-rock, Shin Eun-chul and Go Young-sam.
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 athletics gold medals, both China and Japan had an equal
share of four, with the other two split by Kazakhstan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Jiao Baozhong, 27, outpaced Japanese Daisuke Ikeshima in
the last 150 meters to take the day's first event of the men's 20,000
meters walk by clocking in 1:23:58.59.
</P>
<P>
The other three gold medals for China were through its women
athletes while Japan had their national anthem echoed four times
through its men athletes.
</P>
<P>
Yan Jiankui and Chen Yuxiang finished one-two for China by clocking
23.44 and 23.82 respectively in the women's 200 meters, leaving the
bronze medal to Motoka Arai of Japan in 24.09.
</P>
<P>
"I had a medial performance today but I was confident of taking the
gold medal," said the 21-year-old Yan who clocked 22.86 in the
National Champions Competitions last year.
</P>
<P>
Li Lei of China, who suffered the year long injuries to her waist,
threw her winning distance of 56.92 meters in the fifth attempt to
take the javelin title, beating two South Koreans to second and third
spots.
</P>
<P>
Li Lei, eighth-placer in the Atlanta Olympics, said "the injuries
had halted my training time and again in the year, and now I am aiming
for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jian surged ahead from the beginning and quickened her steps
to clock 2:06.16 in the women's 800 meters, beating Japanese Minori

<P>
TEHRAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran said today its intelligence
service had arrested some members of an anti-government
organization called Mujaheddin Khalq Outfit (MKO) in
Khomeinishahr, some 900 kilometers west of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's official news agency did not specify how many
MKO members were actually arrested.
</P>
<P>
A director of the provincial intelligence department said, on
condition of anonymity, that the MKO members were arrested after
being identified in Khomeinishahr last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the MKO team had been engaged in
stirring up disturbance and disorder among the people of the
region.
</P>
<P>
The arrested elements were handed over to the judicial
officials of the province, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities have tightened security across the
country as the 7th presidential elections, slated to be held on
May 23, are approaching.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the fourth parliament elections in 1992, the
MKO made a series of bombing attacks in the country and the
government reacted by staging an air raid on the MKO base inside
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The MKO led by Mass'oud Rajavi, who lives in Iraq at the
moment, has about 20,000 members in Iraq at present.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, US End Naval Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The five-day Egyptian-U.S. "Eagle
Salute" naval exercises ended today in the Red Sea waters
where for the first time the two sides battled each other in
simulation.
</P>
<P>
The drills, which covered an area from northern Hurghada, in
the east of the country facing the Red Sea, to a point south of
Al-Quseir along the Red Sea, were designed to enhance the planning
and management of the joint work of Egyptian-U.S. naval forces,
according to the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
The exercises, an annual event since 1992, have witnessed the
participating Egyptian and U.S. air and naval units "fight" each
other as imaginary enemies, instead of training as a joint force.
</P>
<P>
According to the rules of the game, each side was left to rely
on its own resources, waging a mock battle according to a plan
kept secret from the other side.
</P>
<P>
The simulated battle began Monday night, the fifth of the
lunar Muslim month, when the moon was hardly visible. The date
had reportedly been chosen carefully to make it difficult for the
participating forces to spot the "enemy."
</P>
<P>
Admiral Ibrahim Youssef Ibrahim, commander of Egypt's Red Sea
naval base, said the most important feature of this year's
exercise was two frigates (from the two sides) "fought" each other.
</P>
<P>
"The participating forces focused on how to use the nature of
the Red Sea theater of operations to their best advantage. The
Red Sea is the favorite theater of the Egyptian forces who have
learned to enlist its natural features as an added weapon," he
was quoted by local Al-Ahram Weekly.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the "Eagle Salute" naval exercise, the Egyptian
and U.S. ground forces have been staging the biennial "Bright
Star" maneuvers since Egypt signed a peace deal with Israel in
1979.
</P>
<P>
This year's "Bright Star" will be staged in September in the
Western Desert and along the country's northern coast.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) urged here today that Deng Xiaoping's thought
on science and technology be studied by cadres and the general
public.
</P>
<P>
Wen Jiabao, a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, was speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Chinese
Academy of Sciences. He said that Deng's thoughts on science are
an important component of his theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
In particular, his innovative statement that "science and
technology are the No.1 productive force" has greatly enriched the
Marxist theory in this regard, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
He said that people should use Deng's theory to observe,
analyze and solve problems, thus maintaining a correct orientation
for scientific and technological work.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Deng's thought should be used to solve problems
that are hindering the development of China's economy and
science, he added, citing problems in the sectors of agriculture,
energy and the environment.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of Crude
palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week mixed
with the first two lower and the third higher.
</P>
<P>
CPO physicals had bearish performance this week with May South
closing the week 40 ringgit (about 16 U.S. dollars) lower to 1,310
ringgit (about 524 U. S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The market sentiment at present is weak following the bearish
palm oil export data for April 1997 released by the Palm Oil
Registration and Licensing Authority (PORLA) on Thursday. Palm oil
exports in April stood at 570,067 tons, lower from 579,642 tons in
March, against the market expectation that palm oil exports in
April would be within 600,000 to 610,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
A dealer said CPO physicals are expected to continue their
bearish performance next week on the lack of fresh leads and
buying interest.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), the tin price ended the
week 26 sen lower to 14.17 ringgit (about 5.668 U.S. dollars) per
kg against 14.43 ringgit (about 5.772 U.S. dollars) per kg last
week.
</P>
<P>
Trading was not as active as last week and the market saw a
total turnover slip to 534 tons from 635 tons previously.
</P>
<P>
The price differential between the KLTM and that of the London
Metal Exchange (LME) stood at a premium of 65 U.S. dollars per ton
against 15 U.S. dollars per ton last week.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM is expected to extend its downtrend next week if the
volatile performance of the LME continues, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
However, The Malaysian rubber market saw some light buying of
mostly SMR grades from the Far East, United States, Australia and
Italy this week.
</P>
<P>
The rebound in the Tokyo, Kobe and Singapore rubber futures as
well as other regional markets boosted up the local market's
sentiment, which has been stagnant for quite sometime.
</P>
<P>
June RSS One rose 8.5 sen to close the week at 278.00 sen
(about 111.2 U.S. cents) per kg while SMR 20 increased by 7.5 sen
to 262.50 sen (about 105 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market price indicator for May 15 was at 214.18 Malaysia/Singapore
cents (sen) per kg against 207.77 cents (sen) on May 8.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average stood at 209.45 cents per kg
against 207.91 cents last week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the local rubber market is expected to extend its
bullishness next week on increased buying interests, especially
from European buyers who normally stock up ahead of the long
summer holidays.

HONG KONG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A small outbreak of German
measles has affected more than 1,500 people in Hong Kong so far
this year, a big jump from the 605 cases reported for the whole
year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
An average of 30 patients were hit by the disease every day
last month, according to statistics released by the Hong Kong
Department of Health.

Kabila said he had taken over power with an agreement of
government army generals in the capital, adding they had assured
him all the military were willing to pledge allegiance to the
newly declared government headed by him.
</P>
<P>
"According to reports from the generals, everyone was ready
to take orders from me," Kabila said, quoted by the reports.
</P>
<P>
His forces would have complete control of the capital within
hours, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would form a transitional government of public
salvation with 72 hours and a constituent assembly within 60
days.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation
of Zaire-Congo led by Kabila took up arms last October to
topple President Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
Facing rebels advance on the capital, Mobutu fled the
besieged city yesterday for his stronghold at Gbadolite in
northern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats believed Mobutu was on his way to exile. They said
the veteran leader, who had ruled the third largest country in
africa for 32 years, might go to Morocco or France.

leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Marshall and Zairian President for life, Mobutu Sese Seko,
will surely not die as a head of state this time. He cowardly fled

African's biggest and richest country to his rival Laurent-Desire
Kabila, after three decades of dictatorship once protected by the
Americans and other Westerners.
</P>
<P>
-- As a goodwill gesture to the Irish Republicans, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair announced on Friday the lifting of a ban
on direct meeting with the Irish independence movement Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), imposed
since the resumption of attacks by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Shanghai is having a renaissance of a goddess which it once
was. President Jacques Chirac today will go to this mythical city
which was the product of an east-west marriage and has inspired
numerous Chinese and Western writers.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has launched a war against
corruption by ordering all government officials and parliamentary
deputies to make public their personal properties within two
months.

<HEADLINE> TVs, ACs Smuggling Costs 62m Dollars to Pak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's national exchequer is
losing about 2.5 billion rupees (about 62 million U.S. dollars)
per annum in revenues due to smuggling of television sets and air
conditioners.
</P>
<P>
According to a market survey, sales of at least 6 brands of
locally manufactured TVs and 4 brands of air conditioners have
gone down by 50 percent during the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that despite a guarantee of two to three years
to consumers in case of local products, consumers prefer to buy
smuggled items, which are often cheaper in price than the local
products.
</P>
<P>
According to the Pakistan Electronic Manufacturers Association,
0.5 million television sets of various brands are smuggled
annually into Pakistan, against a demand of 0.8 million television
sets per annum.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, Thailand Vow to Enhance Mutually Beneficial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Thailand today
emphasized the necessity for the two countries to work in
partnership, at bilateral and regional levels, for their mutual
benefit and for the promotion of peace and prosperity in Southeast
Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued here today on the conclusion of
Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's two-day official visit
to Myanmar, both sides reiterated the importance they attach to
the further development of good-neighborly relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit reaffirmed Thailand's policy to see the admission of
Myanmar as a member of ASEAN, along with Laos and Cambodia, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers noted with satisfaction the ongoing
bilateral cooperation under the economic and technical assistance
program extended by Thailand, agreeing to explore possibilities
for further cooperation, it said.
</P>
<P>
The two governments hope to sign the agreement on cultural
cooperation by the end of this year to mark the 50th anniversary
of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two
countries in August 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to utilize to the fullest extent existing
mechanisms and framework for enhancing bilateral cooperation,
having the opinion that regular exchange of visits between senior
naval officials and the establishment of direct channel of
communications between the two forces would contribute to the
maintenance of security at sea, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers agreed to expedite the demarcation of
Myanmar-Thailand boundary, welcoming the signing during Chavalit's
visit of the Agreement on Border Crossing between the Two
Countries and the Exchange of Notes concerning the jurisdiction
over the Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge on the Moei/ Thaungyin
River as a significant step forward in facilitating trade,
transport and communication between the two countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also agreed that both sides shall
intensify efforts to improve and expand the network of land, sea,
river, rail and air transport and telecommunication linking the
two countries as well as to expedite negotiations on the
conclusion of the Agreement on Commercial Navigation on Upper
Mekong River, it added.
</P>
<P>
Both sides recognized that each country has the right to pursue
its own path of national development and that outside interference
would be counterproductive, it said.
</P>
<P>
The communique added that Chavalit extended an invitation to
Than Shwe, his Myanmar counterpart, to pay an official visit to
Thailand, which was accepted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Central Bank Succeeds in Defending Baht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Speculators in Southeast Asian
currency markets began selling US dollars on Friday, which is a
sign that speculation against the Thai baht had calmed down.
</P>
<P>
In the currency war against the baht which started on Wednesday
and continued on Thursday in overseas markets, the Bank of
Thailand appeared to have regained the upper hand, and
speculators, in particular Americans and Europeans, had lost huge
sums of money in their bets against the baht, dealers and
economists said.
</P>
<P>
The baht traded around 25.80 to the dollar in the spot market
on Friday. In Singapore it moved as high as 25.30 compared with
Thursday's close of 25.50 and Wednesday's 26.33.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night the trading rate of the baht against the
dollar sank to an 11-year low in some western foreign currency
markets.
</P>
<P>
Speculators on Wednesday started the battle by selling baht and
buying dollars. The increase in baht supply pushed the value of
the baht downward, forcing the Bank of Thailand to order all 29
Thai and foreign commercial banks in Thailand to stop selling baht
to foreign speculators, and instructed them to charge the
speculators dearly as a punishment if they wanted to borrow baht.
</P>
<P>
The speculators ended up being charged an overnight two baht
premium on every US dollar, equivalent to an interest rate of
1,000 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, speculators' losses this week had been "fearsome,"
as much as one to 1.25 baht per dollar, a Bangkok-based foreign
trader said.
</P>
<P>
About 20 US and European banks have lost between 100 million
and 200 million dollars each over the past week as a result of
their unsuccessful assault on the baht.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand, which kept the domestic market relatively
unaffected, would not reveal how much it has spent defending the
baht.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the central bank's initial victory, share prices
gained 0.6 percent, or 3.32 points, on Friday, as investors hunted
for bargains with fears of baht devaluation fading.
</P>
<P>
The slight rise in the share price index on Friday came after
plunges over the first four days in the week, totaling 47.56
points, or 7.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the battle to defend the baht cannot yet be considered
over.
</P>
<P>
Even though the Thai central bank makes almost daily
announcement to deny a baht devaluation, the baht is not out of
the woods.
</P>
<P>
Speculators who lost so much during the past week would
certainly lie in wait for another opportunity to make assault on
the baht and to force it to devalue.
</P>
<P>
What is more, analysts believe that there are no clear signs of
an economic recovery in the country. Exports remain stalled and
news in the battered finance and property sectors is likely to get
worse before it gets better.
</P>
<P>
All these factors make the baht still vulnerable to
speculation, despite the fact that the central bank could use
probably 10 billion dollars out of its 38 billion dollars in
reserves to save the baht before it had no choice but to devalue
it.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) closed the week lower with the Composite Index
(CI) at 1,041.91 points, 65.46 points lower from 1,107.37 points
at last week's close due to the weakened Thai baht amid fears that
the situation may affect the local currency ringgit.
</P>
<P>
The Emas Index fell 18.76 points to 297.99 from 316.75 and the
Industrial Index eased 78.63 points to 1,969.05 from 2,047.68 last
week.
</P>
<P>
The Second Board index slipped 30.1 points to 516.07 from
546.17 points previously.
</P>
<P>
The market was mostly bearish throughout the week where the CI
closed at 1,088.52 on Monday and drifted further to close Thursday
at 1,041.27 points, thus recording a 16-month low as a result of
the baht devaluation.
</P>
<P>
However, positive economic figures released on Friday pushed up
share prices to close the week off their lows.
</P>
<P>
The weekly main board turnover increased to 951.776 million
shares worth 5.304 billion ringgit (about 2.1216 billion U.S.
dollars) from 894.463 million shares valued at 5.185 billion
ringgit (about 2.074 billion U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover rose to 142.836 million shares worth
1.448 billion ringgit (about 579.2 million U.S. dollars) from
105.749 million shares valued at 1.227 billion ringgit (about
490.8 million U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Direct business deals increased to 143.460 million shares worth
1.239 billion ringgit (about 495.6 million U.S. dollars) from
119.285 million shares valued at 918.711 million ringgit (about
367.4844 million U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the KLSE is likely to open higher next week but
whether it is sustainable over the medium term is still
questionable.

<HEADLINE> Zairian Rebels Enter Kinshasa, Defense Minister Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Zairian rebels led by Laurent-Desire
Kabila have entered the capital and are near the center of the
city this morning, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The streets of Kinshasa remained deserted this morning and no
sign of street fighting during the night was seen.
</P>
<P>
The shooting of automatic weapons was heard throughout this
morning from the international airport of Ndjili, 25 kilometers
north of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Zairian Defense Minister General Mahele Liyoko was killed by
soldiers of the elite Special Presidential Division (DSP), early
this morning in unclear circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The Zairian rebels have called for an unconditional surrender
of the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Some sources said that Liyoko was asking the soldiers to lay down
their arms and surrender to the rebels. The soldiers executed him
as a traitor outside the Tshatchi barracks where President Mobutu
Sese Seko stayed until his departure Friday.
</P>
<P>
The son of President Mobutu, Commander Mobutu Kungulu, is in the
Tshatchi camp of the DSP, whose commander, General Nzimbi, had fled
to Congo.
</P>
<P>
The French embassy denied that Mobutu Kungulu was seeking asylum
in the embassy.

<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA's
political wing Sinn Fein, today accepted an offer by the British
government for preliminary peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Adams said it had contacted the British government to arrange a
meeting which "should be done without delay," local reports
said. But he did not specify the time and place of the talks.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair offered to send his officials
to meet Sinn Fein party without seeking an IRA truce first. Both
Britain and Ireland banned official contact with Sinn Fein after
IRA quit a 17-month ceasefire in February of last year.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has been fighting against the British rule in Northern
Ireland over the past 28 years, causing heavy loss of lives and
damage of properties.
</P>
<P>
Adams and Sinn Fein's political negotiator, Martin McGuinness,
would go to London on Monday. Both of them have won seats in
British parliament in the May 1 general election.
</P>
<P>
Adams said he would be talking to British officials on the
basis of Sinn Fein's electoral mandate. The party polled some 16
percent of votes in the Catholic Irish nationalist community in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But the Sinn Fein leader rejected any negotiation of a new IRA
ceasefire. The IRA did not make any terrorist bombs since Labor
government took power early this month, a sign of cooperation with
the new government to break the deadlock on the Northern Ireland
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"I have always refused to engage in any speculation about the
IRA because Sinn Fein is not the IRA and we have neither the
responsibility or authority or ability to negotiate a ceasefire,"
Adams said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Record Holder Fails in Long Jump at East Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Asian record holder long jumper Huang
Geng of China failed in his discipline on Saturday as both China and
Japan took four gold medals each from the third-day athletics
competitions at the second East Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Huang, who set the record of 8.38 meters in 1995, leapt to
a miserable distance of 8.03 meters for the silver medal as Japanese
Masaki Morinaga took the men's title in 8.13, while Chen Jing of China
finished third in 7.92 meters.
</P>
<P>
"I was red-flagged in two best attempts of over 8.20 meters, but I
still felt satisfied with the jumps today as I was walking down along
the slope off the peak," said the 27-year-old Huang.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Jiao Baozhong, 27, of Liaoning province, outpaced Japanese
Daisuke Ikeshima in the last 150 meters to take the day's first event
of the men's 20,000 meters walk by clocking in 1:23:58.59. Daisuke
ranked second in 1:23:59.99, with his compatriot Hirofumi Sakai taking
the bronze medal in 1:27:39.38.
</P>
<P>
The other three gold medals for China were through its women
athletes as Yan Jiankui winning the 200 meters, Li Lei in the javelin
and Zhang Jian in the 800 meter finals.
</P>
<P>
Yan Jiankui and Chen Yuxiang finished one-two for China by clocking
23.44 and 23.82 respectively in the women's 200 meters, leaving the

<HEADLINE> China, Indonesia Favorites for Sudriman Cup (Preview) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion China
and 1995 finalist Indonesia are the favorites to win the Sudirman
Cup world mixed team championship starting here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, fresh from their victories at the All-England Open
this March in Birmingham, England, vowed to carry on the winning
momentum to defend their title here.
</P>
<P>
The team, which arrived here two days ago, boasts all the
players who have won four of the five titles at stake at the
All-England Open.
</P>
<P>
China is spearheaded by world number ones in three events:
All-England men's singles champion Dong Jiong, All England and
world women's singles titlist Ye Zhaoying and All England and
Olympic women's doubles champions Ge Fei and Gu Jun.
</P>
<P>
Ge Fei also teamed up with Liu Yong to win the All-England
mixed doubles, making the Chinese overall strength more powerful.
</P>
<P>
The only weakness lies in the men's doubles, where Indonesia's
world number one and three duos Candra Wijaya/Budiarto Sigit and
Denny Kantono/Budi Antonius are dominating.
</P>
<P>
The South East Asian island nation sent here defending men's
singles champion Heryanto Arbi, Olympic women's singles runner-up
Mia Audina, now ranked third in the world in women's singles, and
veteran Susi Susanti.
</P>
<P>
They also have second-ranked women's doubles pair Eliza/Rosiana
Zelin and mixed doubles world number one Trikus Heryanto and
Minarti Timur.
</P>
<P>
But the two powers will not meet in the round-robin group
matches, as China has been placed as the top-seed in Group A of
the top-flight Division 1 with South Korea and England, while
Indonesia is in Group B with Denmark and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
With the South Korean strength sapped by the retirement of
Olympic women's singles champion Bang Soo Hyun and Gil Young Ah,
half of the 1995 women's doubles world champions and also an
Olympic gold medalist in mixed doubles, the Chinese team is
expected to win its two Group A matches.
</P>
<P>
Indonesians could have troubles to beat Group B rival Denmark
since their top men's singles players Arbi and Joko Suprianto are
still haunted by injuries.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, on the other hand, has 1996 Olympic champion Poul-Erik
Hoyer-Larsen, 1997 Taipei Open champion Peter Gade-Christensen,
1997 Japan Open champion Peter Rasmussen and 1997 Korean Open
Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen to choose from playing the men's singles.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, the only European badminton power that could match the
Asians who monopolize the event, hopes to change its fate as the
perennial third-placer in the past four championships.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals of the Division 1, the only division which
has the medal honors, the winner of Group A will meet Group B
runner-up and vice versa. The final is scheduled on May 24.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zairean Rebels Entering Capital After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebels are entering the
capital Kinshasa after Zairean Defence Minister and Chief of Army
Staff Gen. Mahele Lieko Bokungu was killed last night.
</P>
<P>
"Our troops are marching in from the aiport. We are singing as
we are going, and people are cheering", reports reaching here
this morning quoted Laurent Kabila, leader of the rebel Alliance
of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire-Congo, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels were very close to the airport about 25 km
from the city.
</P>
<P>
Kabila spoke after Gen. Mahele was killed late Friday night at
camp Tshatshi in the capital, the barracks residence of Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko, who left the city earlier yesterday
for his palace at Gbadolite in northern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Gen. Mahele was killed by the Special
Presidential Division (DSP). "He went to calm the guys down and
then he was shot," an unidentified western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said he went to the camp with regular army units
to bring DSP members under control. Since his appointment last
December, the general had never been in full control of the DSP.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Mahele was killed, armored cars took up positions
around Kinshasa's Intercontinental Hetel, where prominent members
of Mobutu's 32-year administration were staying.
</P>
<P>
The general was reported to meet rebel leader Kabila in the
Zambian capital today to discuss a transition of power.
</P>
<P>
"Gen. Mahele was to meet Kabila this morning in Lusaka to
discuss a handover of power," said a diplomat in Lusaka, who
declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
"It was a deal brokered by the United States," he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the death of Gen. Mahele, rebel leader
Kabila said he had not heard of it, but he added it was "very,
very bad."
</P>
<P>
Confronted with rebels' advance to the capital, Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko left the besieged city yesterday for
his northern stronghold in Gbadolite. A government statement said
the 66-year-old president had relinquished executive powers.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement added Mobutu did not formally resign "as
head of state", as demanded by Kabila and reportedly proposed by a
peace plan worked out by South African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu's departure has triggered speculation that he was on
his way to exile. Diplomats said he would go to Morocco before
arriving in France finally.
</P>
<P>
The United States yesterday welcomed Mobutu's departure from
power. "The day of the dictator should be over in Zaire and we
hope that a different day has arrived," U.S. State Department
Spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Many residents in Kinshasa welcomed the news that Mobutu had
gone. But they were anxious about what would happen in the next
couple of days as rebel forces are closing in on the capital.
They are in fear that the rebel advance might trigger not only a
battle, but also an orgy of looting by the fleeging government
troops. enditem

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepalese Go to Local Polls Amid Tight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Voters in West Nepal today cast
their ballots to elect village and municipal officials amid tight
security as the country started two-phase local elections, the
second of its kind since this Himalayan kingdom adopted a
multi-party democratic system in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the polls were conducted today in 40 western
districts, including over 1,800 villages and 24 municipalities,
with the polls in many remote hilly villages being postponed
indefinitely due to a boycott campaign by an underground
ultra-leftist movement, the Elections Commission here said.
</P>
<P>
Local administrations in the polling areas took special
measures, such as traffic control, to ensure peaceful elections,
while the country's western borders with India were closed from
Friday to prevent possible criminal activities during the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The local polls are being held in two phases mainly due to lack
of adequate security forces in the country which has only some
40,000 police troops, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
The government has send additional police personnel to West
Nepal to tighten security for the elections and also put army
soldiers on alert in case of uncontrollable incidents, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's special security arrangements seem to
have failed to stop the leftist guerrillas from blocking the
elections at some remote hilly areas.
</P>
<P>
The underground guerrilla group, which launched
anti-establishment armed struggle last year in West Nepal's hilly
areas, has earlier called a boycott to the elections and
successfully disrupted the nomination filing process at many
villages, mostly in Rolpa, Rukum, Jarjarkot and Salyan districts
in mid-west Nepal, a region about 250 km from the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have reportedly spread death threats scaring
away would-be candidates and carried out explosions to terrify
voters away from voting.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10 people, including election candidates, policemen and
guerrilla members, have been killed since last week when the
guerrillas increased their anti-election insurgency, local press
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission decided one week ago to postpone the
polls in 40 villages of the region until further notices as no
single nomination was filed there.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautum Thursday admitted that
polls at over 60 villages could not be conducted as many
candidates at other villages have withdrawn their candidacy under
the guerrillas' boycott pressure.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the government will seek a political solution
to the security crisis caused by the ultra-leftist insurgents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports of clashes over the elections between
workers of main opposition the Nepali Congress (NC) party and
ruling partner the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML) were pouring in as the NC party accused the
government of ignoring CPN-UML workers' illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
The on-going local elections would be actually a popularity
contest between the NC and the CPN-UML, arch rivals in Nepali
politics since the two parties jointly introduced the multi-party
parliamentary system in the country in 1990 amid a popular
movement.
</P>
<P>
The NC gained majority control of the country's over 4,000
local bodies through the last local elections in 1992 when it was
in power but analysts here said it would lose the advantage to the
CPN-UML this time.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML came to power in March as the biggest partner of
the three-party ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Lokendra
Bahadur Chand, who is from a small party.
</P>
<P>
After the second phase of the polls scheduled for May 26 in
Central and East Nepal, the country will see new leadership at
various local levels including village, municipality and district,
which will significantly affect results of the next general
election expected in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official: Turkey Praises China's Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Turkish official has
commended China's policy on Hong Kong, saying that its return to
China will enhance new strength, provide new opportunities and
bring benefits for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen made
the remarks in an exclusive interview with Xinhua at his office
in Ankara later Friday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains that the Chinese government will support Hong
Kong to "maintain its characteristics" and will ensure Hong Kong's
economic prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the concept of 'One China, Two Systems' will be
successful in China," said the undersecretary.
</P>

He also expressed the belief that China will become one of the
most economically advanced countries in the world in the 21th
century.

conveniences for developing the market economy, saying that for
this reason, Turkey is making efforts to develop its economic
ties with China.
</P>
<P>
So far, some Turkish firms have invested in China and Turkey
is trying to step up such investments in China in the future,

<HEADLINE> Turkey Respects China's Sovereignty: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Turkish official has
said that Turkey respects China's independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity at any time as China is Turkey's very
important and great friend.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua in Ankara late Friday,
Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen said that
Turkey and China are important states "at the two ends of Asia,"
both with a long history and rich experience. He added that the
close cooperation between the two countries "will be beneficial
not only to the whole Asia, but also to the whole world."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of resorting to violence, Oymen said "We will not
favor any organization or any people to use violence for whatever
purpose and no matter in China or in Turkey, in the Middle East
or in Europe" as "no political results" can be achieved through
resorting to violence.
</P>
<P>
"Any people can not change the border of a country through
violence," he added.
</P>
<P>
The undersecretary expressed his hope that the people of the
national minorities living in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region will become a bridge linking the friendship between
Turkey and China.
</P>
<P>
Oymen pointed out that Turkey and China should promote
exchange of high-level visits and cooperation in a bid to enhance
the existing bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Moi Accuses Western Countries of Introducing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has accused some Western powers of introducing neo-colonialism to
Africa under the guise of exercising freedom and democracy, the
Kenya Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statements on friday when he officially
opened the South Eastern Agricultural Society of Kenya show held
at Machakos, 80 kilometers southeast of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
He said that the foreign powers imposing their brand of
governance on the developing world are not immune to change and
should leave Africans to manage their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
Moi singled out the United States for censure, reaffirming
that Kenya is a sovereign state pursuing its homegrown democracy
incompatible with foreign ideology.
</P>
<P>
Kenyans could not succumb to pressures from foreigners, said
Moi, adding that he would not accept to be dictated to by
foreigners on how to rule the country.
</P>
<P>
"Foreigners should desist from pushing me or dictating to me
how to rule this country," he stated.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Kenyans should be left alone to decide on the
destiny of their country, cautioning Western countries against
meddling Kenya's internal affairs in the countdown to the coming
general elections.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Faces Criticism over Fiscal Manoeuvres to Save Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- German government is facing a storm of
criticism over its plan to revalue the nation's gold reserves to
help plug widening holes in its budget.
</P>
<P>
Bonn was forced to consider emergency fund-raising measures
including revaluing the central bank's gold reserves and selling
part of its 75 percent stake in the country's telecom flag-carrier
Deutsche Telecom as a government commission reported Thursday that
the government's 1997 tax revenues were projected to fall 18
billion German marks (10.65 billion U.S. dollars) short of earlier
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
For historical reasons, Germany's gold reserves are currently
undervalued at about 14 billion marks (8.3 billion dollars). Under
current market value. they should be 57 billion marks (33.7
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists said revaluing the gold reserves would boost the
Bundesbank's profits and consequently generate addictional revenue
for the national accounts.
</P>
<P>
But such a plan has left Germany open to accusations of playing
fiscal trickery, the very criticism that German officials have
unleashed at Italy and France.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini who
expressed strong disapproval after the German plan was leaked.
</P>
<P>
"I would be very surprised if the German government were to
have recourse to accounting gimmicks... to meet a revenue
shortfall for 1997....By doing this, Germany could put in jeopardy
the healthy functioning of European Monetary Union," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
Bonn's planned fund-raising measures also raised the eyebrows
of many economists in Frankfurt. For them, those measures
represent an unpleasant psychological and risk encouraging other
European countries to make use of technical loopholes.
</P>
<P>
Although economists said under the European Union Maastricht
treaty, profits from the gold revaluation would not directly help
Bonn meet the critical three percent deficit benchmark to qualify
for the planned single European currency, German Finance Ministry
Theo Waigel maintained that such a step would help retire the big
debts run up from the costly German reunification.
</P>
<P>
This will help Germany meet a separate single currency
benchmark, which requires countries to bring their overall
national debts under 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to
qualify.
</P>
<P>
At a special parliamentary debate on budget issues Friday,
Waigel reiterated his optimism about Germany's ability to make the
grade for the single currency, known as the Euro. "We will not go
above the three percent (of GDP) budget limit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also defended plans to
revalue the central bank's gold reserves and rejected claims that
it could lead to a loss of confidence in Germany's stable monetary
policies.
</P>
<P>
"For my European partners, the most important thing is that
Germany takes part in the Euro with a solid build, because without
Germany the Euro will not work," he said.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Builds On Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's property market has seen
another month of recovery after six months of being in the
doldrums, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The slow build-up from decline started in March, figures from
China Real Estate Index system indicate.
</P>
<P>
But real estate observers said several more months are needed
to testify if another round of development in the property market
in the capital city is on the cards after a slack performance that
started in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A report from officials at the index said that Beijing's real
estate price index edged up 1.5 points to 1,092.5 in April, with
office buildings leading the trend, boasting a seven-point
increase.
</P>
<P>
Prices for housing are stable, up only half of one point, while
prices for commercial space and warehousing showed no fluctuations
in April.
</P>
<P>
The indexing system was launched to monitor market changes
nationwide. It bases its calculations on property prices,
reckoning average property prices in November 1994 in Beijing as
1,0000 points.
</P>
<P>
Deng Qing, director at the index's system office, said several
favorable factors, such as two interest-rate cuts and an economic
rearrangement last year, are having an impact on the realty
market, which helped property prices to maintain growth over the
past two months.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Calls for Increased Nordic Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa has
called for increased Nordic investment in Tanzania to solidify
the new Nordic-Tanzanian partnership.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state banquet he hosted for the visiting Finnish
President Marti Ahtisaari on Friday, Mkapa said he was eager for
a gradual change of co-operation to one sustained by investments
and trade.
</P>
<P>
" I look forward to a gradual transformation of our
co-operation from one overwhelmingly dependent on aid to a
mutually beneficial one sustained by investments and trade," said
President Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania is currently putting a lot of emphasis on
encouraging and facilitating the individual and institutional
will to develop.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that Tanzania is trying to get a grip on policy
initiatives for broad-based development in which donor
particcipation is supplementary rather than a substitute for the
people's own efforts.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa thanked Finland for its great contribution to Tanzania's
socio-economic development for the past 30 years and called for
revitalised co-operation.
</P>
<P>
"But time has now come for us to review this co-operation and
revitalise it in conformity with the changed circumstances in our
two countries and in the world," said Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
On regional politics, President Mkapa called on the
international community to fulfil its obligations towards
refugees and displaced people, saying that countries hosting
refugees like Tanzania should be supported to bear the burden.
</P>
<P>
President Ahtisaari said that the 16 prominent Finnish
businessmen accompanying him intended to strengthen trade and
economic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He commended Tanzania for her selfless efforts in looking
after a large number of refugees from Burundi, Zaire and Rwanda,
adding that Finland supported Mwalimu Juliu Nyerere's mediation
role in the Burundi crisis.
</P>
<P>
President Ahtisaari arrived here last evening for a three-day
official visit to Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Writes to Clinton for Help to Solve Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- President of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat has written a letter to
U.S. President Bill Clinton asking him to personally step in to
solve the crisis in the peace process, according to the state-run
Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called on the U.S. to play a more active role in its
mediation efforts, while meeting with U.S. Middle East peace
coordinator Dennis Ross in the West Bank city of Nablus on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in the region last week to conduct his shuttle
diplomacy between Israeli and Palestinian leaders in an attempt
to help revive the peace talks that had broken off since
Israel began construction of a Jewish settlement at Har Homa in
East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
But his mediation failed as Israel rejected a call for the
halt of the construction. Arafat called off a scheduled meeting
with him on Thursday night. It was reported that the Palestinians
accused Ross of siding with Israel in evading the sticking point
of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his meeting with Arafat, Ross had also met with
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai. He had also exchanged views with EU special
envoy to the Middle East peace process, Miguel Angel Moratinos.
</P>
<P>
Before departure for Washington Friday night, Ross insisted
that there is a very clear desire to find a way to promote the
peace march.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Washington, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Friday night met with Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy in what Israeli officials described as a higher-level
discussion of the peace process predicament. But the report did
not say where the talks took place.
</P>
<P>
Albright promised continued U.S. support for Israel and made
it clear that she had no intention to visit the Middle East
until the Israelis and Palestinians make the difficult decisions
to advance the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Levy expressed satisfaction over the meeting and said Ross
will return to the Middle East soon to help resume the
negotiations with the Palestinians.

BUENOS AIRES, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos

</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, Menem
thanked the Chinese government for inviting Foreign Minister Guido
di Tella to attend the ceremonies marking Hong Kong's return to
China on July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>

Minister Jorge Rodriguez and Economics Minister Roque Fernandez,
on bilateral economic and trade relations and the possibility of
enhancing cooperation in such fields as farming, animal husbandry,
mining, and science and technology.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Leaders Endorse Sub-Regional Cooperation: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A concept of sub-regional
cooperation in South Asia has been tacitly okayed by a regional
summit held early this week in the capital of Maldives, Nepali
Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chand, who returned here today from the summit of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) via India, told
reporters at the airport that one of the important achievements of
the 9th SAARC summit was the consensus on promoting sub-regional
cooperation within the SAARC framework.
</P>
<P>
Some misunderstanding arising over the sub-regional cooperation
concept has now been cleared up by the summit in Male, the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
A declaration adopted at the SAARC summit allows three or more
member countries to cooperate on specific projects under the
principle of mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani last December
proposed the idea of sub-regional cooperation in South Asia, or
the Growth Quadrangle including Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and
India, with a view to promoting multi-lateral joint development
efforts in areas like water resources, transportation,
communications and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The concept of sub-region cooperation earlier had drawn fears
among other SAARC members about its possible impact on the
seven-member regional grouping, which was formed in 1985. Other
SAARC members are the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Lohani, who returned here earlier on Friday, said that the
sub-region cooperation now could embark on by identifying specific
projects.
</P>
<P>
Nepal was entrusted last month coordinator in the first-phase
of the four-nation sub-regional cooperation, which will enlist
projects to be studied in detail later on.

</P>
<P>
Under the guide of Commander Charles Precourt, Atlantis had a

According to the schedule of the National Aeronautics and Space

WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. space shuttle Atlantis
docked late tonight with Russian space station, the Mir, ferrying
repair equipment, a replacement oxygen generator and a new crew
member to the outpost.
</P>
<P>
Under the guide of Commander Charles Precourt, Atlantis had a
gentle rendezvous with the Mir at about 10:33 p.m. (02:33 GMT)in
the sixth of nine planned shuttle-Mir dockings to prepare for a
future international space station.
</P>
<P>
According to the schedule of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), the astronauts will open the hatch between
the two spacecraft two hours later. Then Michael Foale will switch
his place with another American astronaut Jerry Linenger, who has
been living there since mid-January.
</P>
<P>
Along with picking up Linenger and dropping off Foale,
Atlantis will deliver more than three tons of water, food, a
new oxygen generator and other science equipment and hardware.
</P>
<P>
Unloading all the goods will probably take five days.
</P>
<P>
Atlantis, the 84th of all American shuttle flights and the
fourth of the year, is expected to land at Kennedy Space Center,
Florida, on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Before the shuttle's launch early Thursday, Dr. Foale told
reporters that he was looking forward to spending the next four
months aboard the Russian complex despite the possibility of
trouble on the 120-ton Mir station.
</P>
<P>
"The station has been up there a long time and there's a lot
of work to do to keep repairing it, maintaining it....I actually
look forward sometimes to these off-nominal situations when things
don't quite go per plan," Foale said.
</P>
<P>
A fire broke out on board in February, and the main oxygen
generator shut down in March. A cooling equipment is leaking and
the carbon dioxide removing system has been a constant headache.
</P>
<P>
Although its predicted life is only five years, the Mir has
circled the Earth more than 64,000 times since its launching in
1986.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Insists on Consolidating Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign
Relations Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia insisted today on the
consolidation of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) before the
creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
He made clear his stance at the 3rd Meeting of Commerce
Ministers of the Americas held here from Thursday to Friday to
discuss the establishment of FTAA, due in the year 2005, by all
the American countries except Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, the biggest South American trade bloc formed by
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, is a success with a gross
domestic product surpassing 1.1 trillion U.S. dollars and a 200
million people market, Lampreia said, stressing the strengthening
and consolidation of it is good for FTAA.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, which faces an increasing trade deficit, insisted on
three basic principles on the establishment of FTAA: the
indissolubility of Mercosur, talks split into stages with tariff
cuts left until last, and a balance between the commitments FTAA
could offer and the profits obtained by its members.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia said eliminating trade barriers among the continent is a
first step to the negotiation of customs tariffs reduction,
while the United States wants everything from tariff cuts to
subsidies to be discussed at the same time.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Urged to Seek Opportunities in Info-Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad has called on all the Malaysians to open up their minds to
the wide-ranging possibilities and opportunities available in
information and multimedia technology development.
</P>
<P>
He made the call today when he officiated the ground-breaking
ceremony and the launching of Cyberjaya in Sepang near here, which
is Malaysia's first smart city located in the Multimedia Super
Corridor (MSC), marking the start of the physical construction of
the MSC.
</P>
<P>
Cyberjaya covering an area of 2,800 hectares is the nucleus of
the MSC, the world's leading intelligent city comparable to the
Silicon Valley in California, U.S. and other similar cities.
</P>
<P>
Next to Cyberjaya is Putrajaya, the federal government's new
administrative center on a 7,000-hectare site. Cyberjaya and
Putrajaya will be separated by a highway known as Route 2020.
</P>
<P>
The MSC, a 15 kilometer by 50 kilometer zone specially for
hi-tech development, is stretching southward from the Kuala
Lumpur city center and is designed to serve as a regional launch
site for companies developing or using advanced multimedia
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said information and multimedia technology should
never be an end in itself. Effectively used, it will act as a
valuable input, and in many cases, a catalyst for many other
industries.
</P>
<P>
He said "advances in multimedia technology will lead to new
applications, spurring the growth of trade and commerce, as well
as the growth of productivity and efficiency in all the sectors."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said although the MSC, particularly Cyberjaya, was
intended to facilitate the country's transition to an information
age multimedia economy, it did not mean that other industries
would take a backseat.
</P>
<P>
There would be numerous opportunities and spin-off benefits in
Cyberjaya, the impact of which would be felt for many generations
ahead, he said adding for example, there would be plenty of rooms
to provide content and value-added services although the main
pipeline would be the multimedia services.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take this opportunity to call upon local
companies to look into strategic alliances and collaboration with
global companies to explore this wide area of content development,
especially to meet the need of the Asia Pacific communities, whose
cultural and social value system may defer from those of the
West," he said.
</P>
<P>
Seven specific sites have already been identified for the
location of some of the pioneering projects in the Flagship Zone
which is the hub of Cyberjaya and a total of 39 companies, both
local and foreign, have already committed to locating their
operations in Cyberjaya.
</P>
<P>
According to Mahathir, by late 1998, phase one, comprising a
750-hectare development area, would be completed while the
remaining area would be developed in stages up to the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
He said based on the high level of interest generated and
positive feedback received over the past few months, his
government was confident that many other companies would soon
follow the lead.
</P>
<P>
Since the launch of MSC last year, Mahathir visited the U.S.
and Japan to personally explain Malaysia's plan to build the
corridor and invite world leading hi-tech companies to invest in
the MSC.

<P>
VIENNA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi said here today that he would put pressure on rival
Albanian parties to compromise on the election issue.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who arrived here this evening on a three-hour flying
visit, made the remarks during the talks with his Austrian
counterpart Viktor Klima.
</P>
<P>
Both Prodi and Klima were worried about the current situation
in Albania and hoped that the Albanian parties could reach
agreement on the controversial election law.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Sali Berisha decreed today the dissolution
of the National Assembly before the end of its mandate and the
holding of new parliamentary elections on June 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, most Albanian parties were threatening to boycott the
coming elections, saying that a new election law, passed earlier
today in the parliament, favors Berisha's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that it would be very difficult for the
international community to provide aid to Albania unless rival
Albanian parties compromise to ensure the fairness and
transparency of the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the forthcoming EU summit to be held in Madrid in
July, both Prodi and Klima agreed to have the employment issue
written down on the revised Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Klima also hoped that Italy could be in the first group to join
the single European Currency, the Euro, and Prodi was confident of
this.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty called for EU members to launch the Euro
by January 1, 1999. But scepticism is growing over whether the
deadline can be met as few members have been able to fulfill the
criteria set by the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The EU commission had put Italy's budget deficit for this year
at 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product, which was 0.2
percent above the ceiling set in the Maastricht Treaty for the
entry of the Euro.

<HEADLINE> Albanian President Dissolves Parliament for Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
announced this evening to dissolve the National Assembly and hold
fresh parliamentary elections on June 29.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Berisha's press office said, "President
Berisha decreed today the dissolution of the National Assembly
before the end of its mandate and the holding of new parliamentary
elections on Sunday June 29, 1997."
</P>
<P>
However, most Albanian political parties were threatening to
boycott the forthcoming elections, saying that a new draft
election law, passed earlier today in the parliament, favors
Berisha's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party, the second-largest party in Albania, and
many other parties boycotted the vote on the draft law and
strongly required amendment to it.
</P>
<P>
The current Democrat-dominated parliament emerged after a
controversial elections held on May 26, 1996. The Socialists
pulled out of the then polls.
</P>
<P>
Albania was plunged into chaos earlier this year after
thousands of families lost their life savings in fraudulent
pyramid investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
Berisha had no option but reach a compromise with other major
parties in the country. Bashkim Fino, a Socialist, became prime
minister of a nine-party Government of National Reconciliation in
March and early elections were conducted.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation is still complicated and delicated now
mainly due to differences between the Democratic Party and other
parties on the revision of the election law.
</P>
<P>
Franz Vranitzky, the special envoy of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), came to mediate among
the Albanian parties on Thursday but again failed to break the ice.
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth visit by Vranitzky to Albania since February
when the unrest broke out.
</P>
<P>
The European envoy told reporters before leaving Albania that
he was worried about the possible boycott of the forthcoming
elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he warned that the OSCE, the European Union and the
European Committee would reconsider the possibilities of providing
humanitarian, economic and financial aid to Albania and of helping
prepare and monitor the elections unless the Albanian parties
reached a compromise on the revision of the election law.

<P>
YANGON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities today handed
over Li Yun Ching (Pongsak Rojanasaksakul), a drug-related Thai
bail jumper, to the Thai government, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken at a time when Thai Prime Minister General
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh is currently on an official visit to
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Li had been indicted on charges of drug trafficking in a Thai
court and had been granted bail at 5 million Baht (about 200,000
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Thai court issued a warrant for his arrest after the bail
jumper failed to appear before the court to face charges in March.
</P>
<P>
He was captured within the Myanmar territory.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar authorities said the handing over of the absconder
was aimed at promoting good relations between Myanmar and Thailand
and at effective fight against narcotic drugs in the region.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Calls for Untied Market for CIS Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Kazak First Deputy Prime Minister
Nigmatzhan Isingarin said here on Friday that an urgent task in
the integration of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is
to set up a united market.
</P>
<P>
Isingarin, also chairman of the Integration Committee of
Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, said there should be a
united market of commodities, services, labor and capital. CIS
members should also develop a customs union and strengthen the
legal basis of their relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there exist some 300 economic agreements
among the CIS members, but most of them, mere demonstration of
intention of the signatories, are not concrete and operational.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the problem to the lack of agreement on a free
trade system and well-coordinated policy on value-added taxes
among CIS members.
</P>
<P>
Isingarin noted that the opening of the border ports and the
efforts on removing tariffs among the four nations have led to the
doubling of Kazakhstan's trade with Kyrgyzstan and a 40 percent
increase in that with Russia in 1996.

a Thai company, according to a report from Trat province, eastern
Thailand.

grow rubber plants in Battambang province and Pailin area.
</P>
<P>
The firm plans to cut old trees down and to grow rubber plants
in 800-1,600 hectare plots yearly.

<HEADLINE> Judge Refuses to Overrule NBA Suspensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. District Court judge Friday
declined to overrule the player bans given by the NBA after
Wednesday's brawl between Miami and New York.
</P>
<P>
The NBA came down hard on the Knicks and Heat on Thursday,
suspending six players a total of seven games. Five Knicks players
were banned a total of six games.
</P>
<P>
NBA Players Association executive director Billy Hunter went to
court claiming the league acted improperly "in suspending those
players who left the bench to act as peacemakers."
</P>
<P>
Judge Jed S. Rakoff's decision came about two hours before the
Knicks, who lead the best-of-seven second-round series with the
Heat 3-2, were due to host game six.
</P>
<P>
Because teams must field no fewer than nine players for playoff
games, the Knicks will be without starting center Patrick Ewing
and shooting guard Allan Houston, as well as guard Charlie Ward.
</P>
<P>
Ward, Ewing and Houston, along with teammates Larry Johnson and
John Starks, were all banned for one game and fined because of the
incident, in which Heat forward P.J. Brown bodyslammed Ward.
</P>
<P>
Ward was fined 6,000 U.S. dollars for his involvement in the
initial incident, while Ewing, Houston, Johnson and Starks were
fined 2,500 dollars for leaving the bench.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Knicks were fined 20,000 U.S. dollars -- 5,000
dollars for each player who left the bench area. Starks also was
fined 5,000 dollars for making an obscene gesture towards the
crowd at Miami Arena.
</P>
<P>
"All of our players serve as peacekeepers, and the reason they
came out was to protect one of their own," Knicks president Ernie
Grunfeld said. "It's sad that they have to be suspended."
</P>
<P>
Brown was suspended for two games and fined 10,000 dollars for
his actions.

<HEADLINE> Unusual Attraction At China's Imperial Summer Resort For Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Tourists visiting the imperial
summer resort of Chengde to the northeast of Beijing are
unexpectedly finding another attraction: edible wild plants.
</P>
<P>
Chengde, which is several hundred kilometers from the Chinese
capital, is the site of a summer resort and eight outer temples
built by emperors of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). It is on
UNESCO'S World Heritage list.
</P>
<P>
The hilly city has more than a thousand types of edible wild
plants and herbs that are served in new dishes prepared by local
restaurants and hotels.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite paradoxical that these herbs, which were used only
by very hungry people and which were considered too humble to to
be served to guests, are now a favorite of many well-to-do
tourists," one city official commented. They are so popular with
the tourists in fact that many take packaged herbs back home as
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
The herbs are also sold in other parts of China and in a dozen
countries and regions outside the country. And, in order to meet
the growing demand, the city has opened over 70 wildplant
processing factories. Last year, the business earned local farmers
an additional 170 million yuan (20 million US dollars).

<P>
South African Holiday, making the sixth defense of the

It said his performance did little to underwrite his rating by

The challenger Taliaferro from America took the early rounds,
which swayed Puerto Rican judge Ceasar Ramos to score the fight
115-111 in his favour.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Companies Seek Cleaner Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of factories and workshops
in Beijing have introduced pollution control and energy saving
measures, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
And a top official has revealed that many of the ecology
schemes have cost little to implement such measures, but have had
a major impact on the environment in China's capital city.
</P>
<P>
So far 50 workshops of 39 enterprises in Beijing have carried
out cleaner production measures. They rationally use resources
and energy, and minimize the production of waste.
</P>
<P>
The practice, introduced over the past four years, proves that
while the enterprises have reduced waste discharge by a large
amount during the process of carrying out cleaner production,
their production cost have also been reduced with more benefits
for the environment.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Xia, an official at Beijing's Environmental Protection
Bureau, disclosed at a press conference that 60 percent of the
schemes for cleaner production measures used in the 50 shops cost
little, but would lead to a 1.84-million-ton reduction in waste
water discharge, and save 366,000 tons of fresh water, reaping
economic benefits of 66.77 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the active promotion of cleaner production, which
emphasizes pollution prevention during production process, is an
important measure against industrial pollution on the way towards
sustainable development in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Many enterprises both at home and abroad have taken cleaner
production as an important part of their development strategy,
according to Cheng.
</P>
<P>
She said that both the enterprises which are lagging behind in
technology and equipment, or short of funds, and those which
claim advanced management and production methods and techniques,
have benefited from the implementation of cleaner production in
the city.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
Friday succeeded in taming the speculative attacks on the peso by
raising the over-night interest rates from 14 percent to 21
percent.
</P>
<P>
The startling 7 percentage point increase in the over-night
money rates is the highest since 1995 when the peso was under a
similar attack after the Mexican peso went on a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
After the timely intervention in the market by the central
bank, the peso regained its bearing while foreign funds, which
were reported Thursday to have started pulling out, were lured to
come back into the system.
</P>
<P>
At the end of Friday, the peso appreciated to 26.373 against
the dollar after a slight depreciation in the morning to 26.375
pesos to the dollar from Thursday's close of 26.374 pesos. The
total turnover hit 618 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The peso came under speculative attacks Thursday on fears that
the volatility of the Thai baht would spill over to other Asian
currencies.
</P>
<P>
As a preemptive measures, the central bank raised the interest
rates to keep the peso's strength and lure back funds.

<HEADLINE> China's Econommy Sees Sound Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- An article in the Beijing weekly
"Outlook" for Monday says that supply in the Chinese market was
slightly bigger than demand and that the country's economy had had
a successful "soft landing" in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, there was a moderate decline
in economic growth, coupled with a decline in demand, with some
enterprises operating under designed capacity of production, while
financial institutions have ample funds.
</P>
<P>
The author of the article, Zhang Liqun, called for closer
monitoring of economic development and warned of a possible
further drop in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The author said that conditions are ripe for economic
improvement for the following reasons:
</P>
<P>
-- Both banks and enterprises have a stronger sense of the
risks involved in investment in new projects. Enterprises are
voluntarily pooling funds to expand production and are sharing
technology in accordance with market needs;
</P>
<P>
-- Savings deposits in China have grown and the use of these
accumulated funds has slowed down;
</P>
<P>
-- There are abundant human and material resources for the
readjustment of the economic structure.
</P>
<P>
The economic restructuring centers on changing the product mix
and production suggests that China's economic development has
entered a new phase. Consumer goods have switched from rapid
growth to smoother growth and to trying to survive by developing
new and high-tech products and by technical innovations. They will
become a driving force in China's national economy, the article
said.

conditions," a provincial official commented.
</P>
<P>
For various reasons, coastal parts of Fujian lack adequate
port, rail, and highway facilities, and there are no railways
feeding Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve this situation, a superhighway is being
planned between Fuzhou, Xiamen and Zhangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Funds are being raised to build three port terminals at Fuzhou,
Xiamen and Meizhou, and a pipeline for locally-produced oil is
also in the works.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (87-88) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (87-88) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: What official language will Hong Kong use after
1997? English or Chinese?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Article 9 of the Basic Law stipulates that, in addition
to the Chinese language, English may be used as an official
language by executive authorities, the legislature and the
judiciary of the Hong Kong SAR. English is also the official
language in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and English will remain as official languages in the
Hong Kong SAR after 1997, with equal importance given to both
languages. This conforms with Hong Kong's status as an
international economic city.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will Marxist-Leninist studies be introduced to Hong
Kong schools after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Hong Kong has a Western-style educational
system. According tothe Basic Law, the government of the Hong Kong
SAR will, on the basis of the region's existing educational
system, formulate policies regarding the development and
improvement of education there.
</P>
<P>
This approach represents the spirit of leaving Hong Kong's
existing systems basically unchanged as stated in the Sino-British
Joint Declaration as well as opinions of educational circles in
Hong Kong calling for policy flexibility in the field of education.
</P>
<P>
As to whether or not Marxist-Leninist courses will be
introduced to Hong Kong schools after 1997, the question itself
shows a lack of understanding on the part of those who pose the
question about the policy of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
The concept of two systems covers ideological systems as well
as the economic sector. The Basic Law specifically provides that
educational institutions of all types may all retain their
autonomy and shall enjoy academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
They will be permitted to continue recruiting staff and using
teaching materials from outside the Hong Kong SAR, for example.

<HEADLINE> Kasparov Wants to Play Deep Blue again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- World chess champion Garry
Kasparov said on Friday he wanted to play the Deep Blue again
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"I want a to play a longer match of 10 games with better
conditions for a human player," the Russian grandmaster, who just
days after a stunning defeat by the IBM supercomputer, was quoted
by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov said he was prepared to play the match in September or
October in New York but under different conditions from the
six-game contest that ended painfully and bitterly for him on
Sunday and gloriously for a team of computer scientists.
</P>
<P>
Before, during and after the 1.1 million U.S. dollars match,
Kasparov complained that the conditions were essentially unfair
because he had no access to the computer program's practice games
in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's interview conducted by Reuters, he acknowledged
that he had agreed to those conditions but said he also felt
unexpected hostility toward him from Deep Blue team members during
the match.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the company said it was difficult to respond
to Kasparov's comments
</P>
<P>
Women's world champion Susan Polgar has also issued a challenge
to play Deep Blue, an IBM RS/6000 SP parallel processor with
specialised microchips for chess that can examine hundreds of
millions of moves per second.

<HEADLINE> North-South Gap in Communications Must Be Closed: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The gap in communications
technology between countries of the North and South should be
closed, representatives of developing countries told a UN meeting
here.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jieyi, representative of China, said this morning that
despite advances, the gap between the developed and developing
countries was growing and developing countries were again facing
the prospect of being marginalized. The control of the mass media
by interests in the developed countries threatened the cultural
and ethical independence of developing countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The mass media would act to promote mutual understanding
between people, world peace and development, Liu said. However,
there had been an unhealthy tendency to use the mass media to
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, attempting
to impose particular values on other peoples, in total disregard
of the rules of international behavior and basic journalistic
ethics, he said.
</P>
<P>
Antonius Agus Sriyono of Indonesia Thursday urged the United
Nations to promote a more just information and communication order
as media should enhance understanding between peoples, not
perpetuate divisivesness.
</P>
<P>
Jeryong Hong of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
stressed that distorted information on the realities in developing
countries was disseminated in the mass media and misused for the
political purpose of individual countries.
</P>
<P>
Tariq Ali Bakhit of the Sudan said that his government rejected
the disinformation campaigns against it which used such items as
ethnic and religious struggles. The Sudan was alarmed and deeply
regretted the disinformation campaigns aimed at spreading an
incorrect picture of Islam.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Steadies Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar ended mostly lower
here today but steadied against the yen somehow, helped by rumors
of central bank sales of the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar finished at 115.55 yen, down from
116.10 Thursday but up from its intraday low of 114.85 yen. The
dollar cost 1.6925 marks, down from 1.6988.
</P>
<P>
The pound weakened broadly. In New York, the pound cost 1.6367
U.S. dollars, down from 1.6426 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The dollar got a temporary boost from a Commerce Department
report of surprisingly strong housing construction in April, which
refreshed speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest
rates next Tuesday. Higher rates will make dollar more attractive.
</P>
<P>
Since hitting a 4.5-year high of 127.46 yen on May 1, the
dollar has dropped about 11 yen or nearly 9 percent, erasing its
gains for the year against the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday:
1.4208 Swiss francs, down from 1.4310; 5.6995 French francs, down
from 5.7110; 1,669.25 Italian lire, down from 1,672.00; 1.3735
Canadian dollars, up from 1.3724.

<HEADLINE> US Offers to Help Zaire in Peaceful Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that it would provide assistance for a peaceful transition in
Zaire as President Mobutu Sese Seko had declared cessation of his
32-year rule of the country.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the United
States would be willing to offer financial and other assistance
to support the transition leading to a "free and fair election."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Bill Clinton said the United States would
"do what we can" to promote a "democratic transition in one of
the largest and most important nations in Africa."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the United States was prepared to offer
about 10 million dollars to support the transition in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
They also said a "democratic Zaire" could receive relief for
the country's U.S. debt, development assistance and
professionalization of the military.
</P>
<P>
But they said Mobutu's prospective successor, Laurent Kabila,
could expect no help from the United States if he opted for what
they called the "Mobutu-style strong-man rule."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters U.S.
officials had discussed the possibility of a "democratic
transition" with Kabila, but had received no commitments from
him.
</P>
<P>
"One way or another, Zaire is about to enter into a new stage
of its history," he said. "It should be a peaceful one and we
believe should be a democratic one and we have encouraged Mr
kabila to recognize the importance of both."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said earlier that the
departure of Mobutu "opens the way for a peaceful resolution of
the military conflict."
</P>
<P>
"I think the most important point here is that Zaire now needs
to move forward away from war towards peace, stability and
elections," she said.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu flew off to Gbadolite, north of the capital of Kinshasa,
today for what his spokesman called a "short rest."
</P>
<P>
Hours later, Information Minister Kin-Kiey Mulumba announced
that Mobutu had "ceased all intervention in the conduct of affairs
of state."
</P>
<P>
"He reigns but does not govern," the information minister told
a press conference. He said Mobutu retained a title.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
plunged nearly 140 points today under the pressure from some
surprisingly strong economic data.
</P>
<P>
The Dow, which on Thursday closed above 7,300 for the first
time, lost 138.88 points, or 1.9 percent, to 7,194.67, trimming
the week's gain to 25.14 points.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 485.78
million shares as against 457.18 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Most broad-market measures also pulled back sharply from
Thursday's record-setting advance.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 12.13 points to
829.75, and the NYSE composite index fell 5.21 to 432.44. Both
measures had closed at record highs on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 12.84 points to 1,340.74, and
the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.25 to 586.72.
</P>
<P>
The technology sector was weighed down by a disappointing
profit report from Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were pressured from the open by the bond market, which
was weighed down by two reports revealing surprisingly strong
consumer sentiment and housing construction.
</P>
<P>
The policy-makers of the Federal Reserve are scheduled to meet
again on Tuesday to decide whether to raise interest rates or not.
</P>
<P>
As bonds fell today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
rose as high as 6.91 percent from late Thursday's 6.86 percent.
