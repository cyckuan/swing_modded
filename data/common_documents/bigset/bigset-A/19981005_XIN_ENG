<HEADLINE> U.S. Cuts Aid to Egypt from 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt, along with Israel with
which it signed a peace deal in 1979, will get less U.S. aid for
the first time in almost two decades, U.S. ambassador to Egypt
Daniel Kurtzer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference Sunday with Zafer el Beshri,
Egypt's minister of state for planning and international
cooperation, Kurtzer said U.S. assistance to Egypt and Israel will
be "reduced by five percent since 1999."
</P>
<P>
However he denied that his country was planning a zero aid to
Egypt, the first Arab country to achieve peace with the Jewish
state under U.S. brokerage. The two have been awarded U.S.
economic and military aid as "peace dividends."
</P>
<P>
According to Kurtzer, the drop in the annual aid to Egypt from
815 million dollars to 775 million is a move the U.S. Congress is
undertaking in view of skinny U.S. budget resources.
</P>
<P>
The Congress has, however, approved to keep military aid to
Egypt intact.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the U.S. on Sunday signed an agreement on
transferring the sum to Egypt. The transfer will take place as
soon as the Cabinet and People's Assembly ratify the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Beshri said American investments in Egypt are steadily rising,
citing a major stake taken by an American company to the Aswan
Steel Company.
</P>
<P>
Kurtzer said that despite the sizable American investments in
Egypt, the U.S. still wanted to put in more through creating a
legislative atmosphere attractive enough to lure more investors to
come over.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Supply and Trade Ahmad Goweili, who attended the
signing of the agreement, said trade exchange between Egypt and
the U.S. is rising progressively and that over the past eight
months it grew by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Electricity and Energy Maher Abaza said the
electricity sector in Egypt benefited greatly from the 1.7 billion
dollars in U.S. aid to the sector alone, with the result that
about 89 percent of villages and remote areas in Egypt are lit up.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. foreign aid budget has been including 815 million
dollars for Egypt, and 1.2 billion for Israel, in addition to aids
earmarked for international organizations. Cairo also gets 1.3
billion dollars in military aid from Washington every year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the U.S. have hold an array of talks in both Cairo
and Washington since July on establishing a new system of
cooperation that puts emphasis on enhancing economic and trade
ties and rescheduling the aid program.

<P>
CAIRO -- A World Bank delegation will proceed to Egypt later

300 million-dollar-loan the Bank has agreed to provide this current

</P>
<P>
According to Sunday's Arabic daily Al Hayat, Egyptian Minister
of Health Ismail Sallam signed the loan agreement with the World
Bank in May.

policies, will help the Egyptian side in defining the ways of
expending the loan and the aspects of modernization in such fields
as hospitals, health insurance and basic welfare.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Arab Investment Company is currently contributing
some 30 million U.S. dollars for seven projects in Jordan, six of
which in the industrial sector, and the seventh in the banking
field, according to a company source. The capital of the bank is
about 412 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic daily Al Hayat reported Sunday that the company's
capital last year stood at 366 million dollars, as compared to
200 million dollars in 1974 when it was set up.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece, Bulgaria and Romania on
Sunday called for a political solution to the Kosovo crisis in
order to avert the possible military intervention by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration released in Delphi, Greece, after the two-day
tripartite talks between Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis,
Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov and Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu, the leaders stressed that the parties concerned in
Kosovo should come to the negotiating table without preconditions,
in order to achieve a peaceful solution for a large autonomy for
Kosovo within the internationally recognized borders of Yugoslavia
and to respect the rights and freedoms of all the inhabitants of
Kosovo, so that another course of action by NATO be avoided.
</P>
<P>
They said that as immediate neighbors of Yugoslavia, the three
countries were deeply concerned that further negative developments
in Kosovo could have serious consequences for the three countries
and the Balkan region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
As for Albania, the three leaders called on the country's
government and political parties to use political dialogue and
create a state of law, enabling democratic institutions to
operate.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to strengthen cooperation between the three
countries and to encourage contacts on a bilateral and
multilateral level involving other countries in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders agreed to hold regular summits, with the next
session due in Bulgaria at an unspecified date.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Concludes Brief Visit to Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak concluded his brief visit here aimed to defuse tension
between Syria and Turkey, and left for Cairo Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak held talks with his Syrian counterpart Hafez al Assad
immediately after arrival earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
According to a Syrian spokesman, Assad discussed with Mubarak
"the latest developments in the region in the light of the
escalating statements released by the Turkish side over the past
few days."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of sheltering its outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party, which has been fighting since 1984 for an
independent homeland in southeastern Turkey, and threaten to wipe
out Kurdish bases in Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria denied the accusation, and charged that Turkey formed a
military alliance with Israel that does harm to Arab security, and
built a string of dams on the Euphrates River that could reduce
Syria's water supply.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is using his good offices to contain the growing crisis
between Syria and Turkey, and to seek a political solution rather
than military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
He is to meet Turkish President Suleyman Demirel in Ankara to
continue his mediation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is calling for dialogue between Damascus and Ankara, on
the grounds of good neighborliness and understanding, to resolve
their differences.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who accompanied Mubarak
on the mission, said here Sunday that the region cannot afford
military solutions, which may cause serious problems and grave
consequences.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korea's national
coach Cha Bum-kum led the Shenzhen Ping'an to a 2-0 victory over
Wuhan Hongjinlong, coached by former China's national coach Qi
Wusheng, in the China's first division league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Both coaches were sacked after failing to make any remarkable
performances in the World Cup qualifiers and the finals
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Hongjinlong played most of the match with ten players after
Yang Xiaochun was sent as he tackled down Zhang Jun in the 31 min
utes.
</P>
<P>
Xie Feng slotted in the opener from the resulting free-kick
and set up Li Weifeng on another in the second half. The latter
headed in the second goal in the 56 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Struggling in the relegation group with three rounds left this
season, both teams needed at least two victories to secure places
in the first division.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Wanda, who has won the title in last round, showed no
sign of backfire after announcing to sell the club after its loss
in the league Cup semi-finals, beating Vanguard Huandao 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Wanda said in its announcement of withdraw from the Chinese
soccer that it could not endure the "wrong ruling" of the
referees in Chinese soccer as the team was deprived of two
penalties and eventually lost to Liaoning Tianrun 5-6 in a penal
ty shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
With the title out of hand, Shanghai Shenhua moved one step up
to secure second place after ousting the bottom Guangzhou Apollo
2-0.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other matches, Yanbian Aodong lost to the visiting
Shandong Luneng 1-0, Qingdao Hainiu upset Guangzhou Songri 2-0
and Chinese Army clinches a golden 3-0 victory from Shenyang
Haishi.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Religious Team Visits Iran to Better Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 4 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi religious delegation
left here Sunday for a visit to Iran, as part of the effort to
improve relations between the long-time hostile neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Head of the delegation Abdurrazzaq al-Saadi, general secretary
of the Organization of the People's Islamic Conference, said the
visit came at the invitation of an Iranian cultural and Islamic
organization.
</P>
<P>
He said his delegation would discuss means of promoting
relations between his organization and the Iranian side, and will
give a briefing on the adverse impact of the "inequitable
embargo" imposed on Iraq by the U.N. eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will drum up Islamic position to help put an end
to the crippling sanctions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Religious exchanges stopped between Iraq and Iran after the
breakout of their eight-year, protracted war in the 1980s. More
recently they have held a series of talks in an effort to solve
pending issues.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 6,000 prisoners of war (POWs) from both countries were
freed and expatriated last April in the biggest POW swap since
1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq opened its border with Iran last year, and a few months
ago it commissioned a checkpoint complex near the town of
Munthiriya on the border to facilitate exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Iranian pilgrims have been permitted into Iraq to
visit holy Shiite Muslim shrines in the south for the first time
in 18 years.

JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Participants in a conference
on European-Palestinian partnership on Sunday called on Israel to
implement U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, which they deemed as the
basis for economic and social development in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which began last week and ended Sunday in the
West Bank city of Ramallah, was attended by European and
Palestinian diplomats, officials and academics, a Jerusalem-based
Palestinian press service reported.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC) quoted
European diplomats as saying that the implementation of the U.N.
resolutions, which call for Israeli withdrawal from occupied
territories, will open the way for regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The participants also urged Israeli government to halt
unilateral measures like demolishing Palestinian houses, expanding
Jewish settlements and "Judaizing" Jerusalem, the JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has reportedly asked Israel to freeze
the expansion of Jewish settlements in exchange for Palestinian
agreement to refrain from building houses without permits.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 158 Candidates Approved for Elections of Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's powerful Guardians
Council has approved the qualification of 158 candidates for the
forthcoming elections of the Experts Assembly, the Interior
Ministry announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total 396 applicants registered for the elections
on October 23, 49 did not take part in the exam given by the
Guardians Council to decide their qualification and 14 withdrew
their applications, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that it would release on Wednesday the
final list of candidates for the elections of the 86-seat Experts
Assembly, which determines the country's supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, the Experts Assembly has the
right to choose a supreme leader or a leadership council and to
dismiss the leader if he was not qualified or had some problems.
</P>
<P>
A number of applicants whose qualifications were rejected by the
Guardians Council have applied for reviewing their status and the
council is expected to release the final list of qualified
candidates by Wednesday, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
According to the elections law, the conservative-dominated
Guards Council, whose function is to explain and defend the
country's constitution, is authorized to review the qualifications
of candidates for any elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here regard the forthcoming elections of
the Experts Assembly as the most important one after the
presidential elections in May, last year when President Mohammad
Khatami defeated the conservative candidate Majlis Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq Nouri.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militia Calls for US, French Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-allied South Lebanon
Army (SLA) has called on the United States or France to mediate in
its proposed withdrawal from Jezzine, the country's southern
Christian town, the National Broadcast Network radio reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by SLA's leader Antoine Lahd when he met
with notables coming from Jezzine on Saturday, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted the U.S. or France to mediate between the SLA
and the Beirut government on its pullout from the area under his
announced principles.
</P>
<P>
Jezzine, just north of the Israeli "security zone" in south
Lebanon, has been policed by the SLA since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-styled security zone in 1985 to
allegedly protect its north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Lahd offered to withdraw from Jezzine provided
government troops take over the vacated place and prevent
military groups from entering and using it as a base to attack
the militia or Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government rejected the offer, dismissing it as a
similar manoeuvre made by Israel five months ago.
</P>
<P>
In April, Israeli Cabinet endorsed the 20-year-old United
Nations Resolution 425 but conditioned its implementation on
Lebanese government's negotiated guarantee for Israel's security
in the north.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the offer, saying the resolution asks Israel
to withdraw from Lebanon without any conditions.

DAMASCUS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa reaffirmed here Sunday the need to resolve the dispute

dialog rather than any other means.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have mounted between the two neighboring countries
after Ankara reportedly massed up troops along its borders with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Turkey have been at loggerheads over issues of
separatist Kurds, water-sharing and the Turkish-Israeli
military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of backing the Turkish Kurdish
rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy of the
Kurds in southeastern Turkey and often launched across-border
attacks from their bases in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
And Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliance with
Israel, saying that it threatens Arab security and undermines
Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa said that "we in Syria are astonished and surprised
about such statements as those recently uttered by Turkish senior
political and military officials."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the repeated Syrian calls for dialog with Turkey,
but had no response on the part of Turkey, Sharaa said that it is
regrettable that there be no reaction to the balanced and rational
Syrian position.
</P>
<P>
He noted that such Turkish stance is the cause of concern to
all Arabs, and "we do not have a pre-conceived attitude toward
Turkey because we are an Islamic neighboring country."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Mubarak's efforts and contacts with
Turkish officials in Turkey will be fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak concluded his brief visit to Syria and left for Cairo
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He is to meet Turkish President Suleyman Demirel in Ankara to
continue his mediation.

<HEADLINE> Two MKO Members Killed in Southwestern Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces killed
two members of the outlawed Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO) in
southwestern Iran, the Information Ministry announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An official with the ministry said the MKO members carrying
revolvers and hand grenades were discovered and killed in an
exchange of fire with the security forces in Ahwaz, capital city
of the southwestern province of Khozestan.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, the two were
identified as Qodrat Baqeri and Nijan Sagvand, both members of a
team from MKO bases inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
MKO, or Organization of Holy Warriors of the People, was allied
with the Islamic revolution until the overthrow of the Iranian
monarchy in 1979. It then turned against the rule of clergymen and
launched its campaign of bombings and assassinations in an effort
to undermine the Tehran regime.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla group, after being expelled by the French
government in 1986, moved its headquarters to Iraq and staged
military intrusions into western Iran.
</P>
<P>
The IRNA report, however, did not say when the two fugitives
were killed.

<HEADLINE> AL Urges Peaceful Solution to Syrian-Turkish Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Sunday urged
both Syria and Turkey to exercise self-restraint and tackle the
cause of growing tension between them within the framework of good
neighborly ties and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Sunday, the league hailed the initiative
launched by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to defuse the
Syrian-Turkish crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak flew to Damascus Sunday morning and will visit Ankara
on Monday in a bid to mediate a peaceful solution instead of
military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly massed troops and armored vehicles along
its border with Syria after stepping up accusations in the past
week that Syria is supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels, which Syria
denied.
</P>
<P>
Syria, on the other hand, blamed Turkey for forming a military
alliance that threats Arab security. It is also infuriated by
Turkey's building of a string of dams on the Euphrates River which
could worsen Syria's already short supply of water.
</P>
<P>
The AL statement voiced hope that Turkey would re-consider its
military cooperation with Israel which "imposes serious negative
impact which started to cast doubt on the security and stability
of the region."
</P>
<P>
The Turkey-Israel military cooperation started in February 1996
with the signing of two agreements, and the two sides have since
carried out cooperation in weapon upgrading, training and rescue.
</P>
<P>
Syria has disputes with Israel over the future of the Golan
Heights, which was captured by the Jewish state in the 1967
Mideast War.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government
condemned the Sudanese air attack on Pakele trading center in the
northwestern district of Moyo district.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issed by the Ugandan Defense Ministry Sunday
evening, State Minister of Defense, Steven Kavuma, described the
act as an "act of aggression" which violates international law
and the principle of good neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio Uganda report, a Sudanese military Antonov
plane Saturday dropped four bombs which destroyed some houses and
injured four women and two children.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the Ugandan government will do everything
within its capacity to protect people's life and property from
the irresponsible acts of the Sudanese authorities.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has accused Uganda of sending soldiers to fight along
with the rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) against
Khartoum, a charge Kampala denied.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government also denied a report that over 500
Ugandan troops had been killed in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Sudan launched a general mobilization across the
country by closing universities and calling on young men to take
up arms for a war that they called a war to end wars.

<HEADLINE> House Judiciary Committee Chairman Hopes for Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Chairman Henry Hyde of the
Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives said on
Sunday he hopes to finish his impeachment inquiry by year's end
but won't accept Democratic demands for limits on the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Hyde also said the Senate so far does not have the two-thirds
majority necessary to remove President Bill Clinton from office
</P>
<P>
"You know how New Year's resolutions sometimes get broken, but
it's my hope and prayer that we could finish by New Year's," the
Illinois Republican said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to meet on Monday to
deliberate a Republican resolution recommending an open-ended
inquiry into whether Clinton's behavior warrants impeachment. The
Democrats are to offer a separate version that would put a
deadline on the inquiry and limit it to the Monica Lewinsky
affair, but it is expected to be defeated in the
Republican-controlled panel.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Hyde again rejected the Democratic demands. The
Judiciary Committee anticipates no more material from Starr, Hyde
said, "We are not seeking that. We're not out trolling for
additional issues. But if they come to our attention we will deal
with them."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hyde admitted that if the House votes to
impeach, or indict, the president, the 67 votes required in the
Senate to remove him from office are not there. "They won't do
that until the American people move, and they have to move from
where they apparently are if the polls are true," Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
Hyde said it is possible that after the House ends its
investigation the Senate could move to end the matter by censuring
the president. "Everything is possible," he said. "I wouldn't rule
anything out."
</P>
<P>
He said Starr would have to be involved in any censure
negotiations to deal with the issue of whether Clinton could still
be indicted for charges in the Starr report, such as perjury and
obstruction of justice, after he leaves office.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Lodges Complaint With UN Against Uganda, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
lodged a complaint with U.N. Security Council against Uganda for
its aggression against Sudanese territory, and Eritrea for being
an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press Sunday, Sudanese Undersecretary for
Foreign Affairs Hassan Abdin said Sudan has called upon the
Security Council to undertake its responsibility with regard to
this aggression which he described as flagrant violation of the
U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sudan has officially informed the League of Arab
States about the motives and scale of the aggression which he said
constituted a violation of Sudan's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Similar memoranda were addressed to the Organization of African
Unity, the Organisation of Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned
Movement, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdin said that Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir will also
send letters to African heads of state expounding the motives and
results of the aggression.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has accused Uganda and Eritrea of aiding the Sudanese
rebels, a claim denied by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between Sudanese forces on the one hand, and Ugandan
forces and those of the southern Sudanese rebels on the other,
began on September 14 and are still going east of Equatoria, the
remotest southern Sudanese state.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns Fresh Turkish Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Sunday condemned the
fresh Turkish invasion of its northern territory, saying it
violated the U.N. Charter and principles of good neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, the Foreign
Ministry said more than 10,000 Turkish troops invaded northern
Iraq on October 2 under the pretext of chasing elements of its
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Kurdish rebels have been fighting since 1984 for an
independent homeland in southeastern part of the country. They
found shelter in northern Iraq after Baghdad was rendered
ineffective in its control over there.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, Turkish troops have repeatedly crossed
into northern Iraq in an effort to wipe out Kurdish rebel bases,
from where the guerrillas often launched attacks on target inside
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the fresh Turkish invasion had caused serious
harms to Iraqi people and their properties, and Iraqi government
condemns the Turkish armed forces' violation of its territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The statement called upon Turkish government to immediately
stop these actions that contradict the U.N. Charter and the
principles of the international law, and take into considerations
the good neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
It criticized Ankara for adopting a "double-standard policy"
that has contributed to the abnormal situation in the north of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has provided since 1991 military base for the U.S. and
British force to enforce the no-fly zone in northern Iraq, where
Iraqi Kurdish population live.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said the no-fly zone "has harmed not only
the Iraqi people, but also Turkey itself by aggravating its own
Kurdish problem."

<HEADLINE> UK Drops Hint of Sending NATO Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson Sunday dropped a strong hint that NATO may send troops
to Kosovo to enforce any political settlement of the worsening
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview early Sunday, Robertson
said: "It is conceivable that if (Yugoslav President) Slobodan
Milosevic is involved in a genuine ceasefire -- and not just some
cat-and-mouse tactic that he's been involved in before -- and
there is a prospect of a political settlement on the ground."
</P>
<P>
However, the British Defense chief also made it clear that NATO
is determined to make strong intervention. He said: "There clearly
would have to be NATO troops to enforce it, or keep the peace."
</P>
<P>
Robertson noted that it remained to be seen whether the current
withdrawal of Serbian security forces from Kosovo would go far
enough to put Belgrade in compliance with a U.N. Security Council
resolution demanding that it cease all military operations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Robertson stressed that the international community
opposed the independence for Kosovo but wanted a political
settlement that ends the violence.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO forces that are being assembled, the military options
that are now ready, are all designed to make sure that there is a
permanent peace in that area and that the disproportionate
violence that has been used against civilians is going to stop,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Yugoslavia to Comply Fully With UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Monday urged Belgrade to fully comply with the U.N. Security Council
resolution, calling for an immediate end to the violence in Kosovo
and for early negotiations on a political solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers, at their general affairs council meeting,
agreed that continuing violence in the Yugoslav province only
resulted in the indiscriminate loss of life among the civilian
population, an unending stream of refugees and displaced persons
and the wanton destruction of civilian property.
</P>
<P>
The ministers underlined the importance of the adoption of
U.N. Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1199 on September 23 and
expected full and immediate compliance.
</P>
<P>
They were also looking forward to the Kosovo report to be
submitted by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and to the earliest
possible consideration of the report by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The ministers condemned those responsible for recent
atrocities in Kosovo and called upon the authorities in Belgrade
to investigate, and identify and punish those responsible immediately.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting welcomed a proposal put forward by the EU's
Austrian presidency that forensic experts be sent to Kosovo to
examine the alleged killings of civilians.
</P>
<P>
An EU expert team will make the trip once the technical details
are taken care of.
</P>
<P>
The ministers stressed the absolute urgency of improving the
humanitarian situation in Kosovo, where there was a problem with
more than 250,000 refugees and displaced people, many dwelling in
makeshift shelters in forests and mountains as winter fast
approaches.
</P>
<P>
The council accused Belgrade of being primarily responsible for
the refugee problem and expressed its determination to further
increase the effectiveness of the existing EU sanctions against
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
It also promised to make the fullest possible contribution to
the international community's pressure on the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia with the exception of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union has already imposed an arms embargo, a
freeze of Yugoslav government-owned assets in EU member states and
a ban on flights to EU airports by Yugoslav national carrier JAT.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Toughens Penalty for Immigration Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's amended
Immigration
Bill, designed to effectively curb illegal immigration, came into
force Monday with the objective of imposing tougher penalty for
immigration offenses.
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed by the Parliament a month ago, "will enable us
to deal more effectively with the illegal immigration problem,"
Singapore Immigration &AMP; Registration (SI&AMP;R) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, severer punishment is rendered for attempted
illegal entry and departure, abetment of illegal entry as well as
employment of immigration offenders.
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty for attempted illegal entry will be six
months' imprisonment and a mandatory minimum of three strokes of
the cane compared with the previous maximum penalty of two years'
imprisonment and a fine of 4,000 Singapore dollars, but no caning.
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty for attempted illegal departure will be six
months' jail and a fine of 2,000 Singapore dollars compared with
the previous maximum of three months' imprisonment and a fine of
2,000 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Illegal entry abettors will be punished with a mandatory
minimum of three strokes of the cane in addition to the existing
penalty of between six months and two years' jail.
</P>
<P>
The maximum fine for employers (of more than five immigration
offenders) who cannot be caned because they are females or are
more than 50 years old will be increased from 6,000 to 10,000
Singapore dollars in addition to imprisonment of between six
months and two years.
</P>
<P>
Corporate bodies will be fined 100,000 to 200,000 Singapore
dollars for employing immigration offenders, doubling the previous
amount of 50,000 to 100,000 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
The amendments also introduce a presumption clause in the
Immigration Act which will put the onus on a suspected illegal
immigrant to satisfy the court that he was not attempting to enter
Singapore illegally.
</P>
<P>
With the presumption clause, any foreigner found in Singapore
port waters without any valid travel document, or with no visible
means of subsistence will be presumed to be attempting to enter
Singapore illegally.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners found taking precautions at Singapore port waters to
conceal his identity or presence from police or immigration
officers will be treated as offenders attempting to enter
Singapore illegally.
</P>
<P>
the SI&AMP;R also announced that it will continue to conduct raids
and undertake enforcement action to keep the illegal immigration
problem under control.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the beginning of this year, Singapore tightened
measures in a precautionary move to stop inflow of illegal
immigrants and these measures resulted in entry denial of a total
of 60,000 persons largely fleeing economic woes in other countries
in the South and Southeast Asian regions.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics show that the police arrested 3,477
illegal immigrants in the first half of the year, 108 less
compared with the same period last year which had the record peak
figure.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Must Compel Israel to Honor Accords: Erekat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians hope that
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will compel the
Israeli side to remain within the limits of signed agreements and
implement them.
</P>
<P>
This was made clear by Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat on Monday in the West Bank town of Jericho in an interview
with the Voice of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said the Palestinian side also wants Albright to obtain
political decisions from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to reach agreements on issues being discussed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to arrive here on Tuesday to push
forward the peace process and to prepare for a tripartite meeting
due to take place in Washington by mid-October among Netanyahu,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Albright will focus this time with all her power
on obtaining a 'yes' from Netanyahu since it is the only and
shortest way to achieve an agreement before the summit in
Washington," Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinian side has already presented to the
Israeli side a list of Palestinian prisoners and asked Israel to
open its prisons and release them.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said Albright will hold two rounds of talks with
Arafat, one is in Jericho Tuesday afternoon and another in Gaza
the following day.
</P>
<P>
Soon after her arrival on Tuesday, Albright will hold talks
with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Besides the scope of Israeli troops redeployment in the West
Bank, the security cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians
is another key issue hindering the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel wants the Palestinian side to take specific measures to
fight terrorism to ensure Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Other issues such as the Gaza airport, seaport, safe passage
linking the West Bank and Gaza Strip also remained unsettled.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said he will discuss these issues with Israeli Cabinet
Secretary Danny Naveh on Tuesday.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Judiciary
Committee on Monday convened to consider whether to set in motion
a formal impeachment investigation of U.S. President Bill Clinton
for his conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
The committee, with a 21-16 Republican majority over Democrats,
is expected to vote later in the day or on Tuesday in favor of
conducting an impeachment investigation, the first against a
president since the Watergate scandal in 1974 and the third in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
The committee meeting was opened by Henry Hyde, its Republican
chairman, who has said he hopes to complete the investigation by
the beginning of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The committee has been deeply divided along party lines since
it received the report on the Lewinsky case from special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr on September 9.
</P>
<P>
A ranking Democrat on the committee, John Conyers of
Michigan, said on Monday morning it was too early to say if the
Democrats would vote for the impeachment hearings.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese President to Visit Thailand Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese President Tran Duc
Luong will go to Bangkok Tuesday for a three-day official visit
to Thailand at the invitation of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, it was
announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first Thailand visit by a Vietnamese president
since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and Thailand signed 13 agreements on trade, investment,
avoidance of double taxation, science and technology, tourism,
culture, visa exemption for bearers of diplomatic and official
passports.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade volume increased to 910 million U.S. dollars in
1997 from 352 million in 1994. It reached 331 million dollars in
the first five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam exports seafood, mineral ores, coffee, vegetables and
fruit to Thailand and imports motorbikes, paint, tube iron,
electronic appliances and consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has invested in 78 projects in Vietnam with a combined
capital of 1.08 billion U.S. dollars, ranking ninth among the
countries and regions having investment in Vietnam. Thai investors
are involved in mining, food processing, cement production, hotel
construction and fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have gradually solved outstanding problems.
They signed an agreement on delineation of the maritime boundary
in the Gulf of Thailand in August 1997, and reached agreement on
regulations on joint patrols in the adjacent maritime areas, thus
helping put an end to illegal netting operations.
</P>
<P>
To promote bilateral relations, Thailand permitted Vietnamese
nationals to integrate into Thai society since 1992. The
integration process has accelerated since Vietnam joined the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1995.

<HEADLINE> China Has long been Striving for Realizing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- "To realize human
rights is the aspiration of all humanity. It is also a goal that
the Chinese Government has long been striving for," a senior
Chinese envoy said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, said that "We believe that the universality of human
rights should be respected and it can be even better reflected
once it is combined with the specific conditions of various
countries."
</P>
<P>
Qin made the statement at the signing ceremony of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. He signed
the Covenant on behalf of the Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
"As a developing country with a population of 1.2 billion,
China knows all too well the importance of the right to
subsistence and the right to development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people's livelihood has been greatly improved, he
said, "This, to a large extent, promoted the realization of their
economic, social and cultural rights."
</P>
<P>
"As a socialist country under the rule of law, China attaches
equal importance to individual human rights," he said, "It
respects and protects civil and political rights and opposes any
acts that violate a citizen's legitimate rights."
</P>
<P>
Ever since 1978, Chinese legislature has promulgated over 300
laws and law-related decisions, he said, adding that a relatively
complete legal system for the protection of human rights has taken
shape.
</P>
<P>
"All the tremendous progress China has made so far has laid the
solid foundation for China to sign or accede to more international
human rights instruments," he added.
</P>
<P>
On September 23, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, in his
speech to the 53rd General Assembly session, declared that China
would sign the Covenant in early October.
</P>
<P>
The Covenant was adopted by the General Assembly and opened for
signature in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese soldier was wounded on
Monday in an Israeli shelling on Lebanon's eastern province of
Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
The soldier was hit when Israeli troops shelled a post of the
Lebanese army in western Bekaa in a retaliatory attack on
Hezbollah, Lebanon's main resistance group, the Orient Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
He is believed to be the first Lebanese soldier wounded this
year in armed clashes between Lebanese guerrillas and Israeli
forces.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, attacked a post of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) Monday morning on the
verge of the Israeli-occupied south Lebanon with machine guns and
grenades. There was no immediate report of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone in south Lebanon in 1985
to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks
by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is spearheading a guerrilla war to oust more than
1,500 Israeli troops and about 3,000 SLA militiamen out of south
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Seeks Closer Ties with Russia, NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze on Monday moved to reassure Russia over Georgia's
links with NATO, saying both countries had strategic common
interests.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted the president as saying that he
welcomed the selection of Yevgeny Primakov as the new Russian
prime minister and stressing that Russia's internal stability had
a great influence on Georgia and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana's visit last
week, he said Georgia was developing its ties with the alliance to
promote its integration into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said it was believed to be the first time the
president had announced his country's willingness to develop ties
with NATO.
</P>
<P>
The growing cooperation could also spell the revival of
scientific departments which made great contributions to the
country's military and civilian industries during the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
The president confirmed he and Solana discussed stronger
military links and held similar views on many international and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Georgian-Russian ties could be improved, said Shevardnadze, but
he added, "The sooner the conflict in Abkhazia is settled, the
faster the relations between the two countries will develop in
political, economic, spiritual and other fields."
</P>
<P>
A military conflict broke out in 1992 when Abkhazia, an
autonomous republic of Georgia, declared itself a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Shevardnadze and the Abkhazian leadership,
Russian peacekeeping troops entered Abkhazia in mid-1994. Under
the mediation of Russia and the U.N., a ceasefire was reached in
the same year. However, the final status of Abkhazia has yet to be
decided.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Crisis Not Changed: NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The NATO allies said on Monday
that the Kosovo crisis had not been eased as had been expected
after the adoption of the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 1199.
</P>
<P>
Veteran United States envoy to the Balkans Richard Holbrooke
quoted NATO Secretary General Javier Solana as saying that the
situation in the Yugoslav province "remained fully as serious
today as it was a week or two ago".
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke briefed NATO allies during a stopover before going on
to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance was expecting a situation
clarification report to be delivered by the United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan on Monday and due to be considered by
the Security Council later in the week.
</P>
<P>
Some NATO allies argued that a U.N. finding that the Yugoslav
authorities were defying the UNSCR 1199 adopted on September 23
calling for an immediate cease of violence in Kosovo would give
them the legal basis for "further measures" to enforce the demands
put forward by the resolution.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been trying to get a U.N. mandate as the legal basis
for its planned military intervention in the Yugoslav province in
the form of air strikes or deployment of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers agreed in May to authorize the military
arm of the 16-nation alliance to study the options that can be
used in the event of a military intervention.
</P>
<P>
NATO conducted an air-borne exercise in neighboring Albania on
June 18, immediately after its defense ministers met in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The alliance activated its action warning on September 24 for
initiating the air strikes after the United Nations adopted the
1199 resolution and the action warning would pave the way for the
eventual intervention.
</P>
<P>
But Russia has warned repeatedly that it would veto any U.N.
resolution that would otherwise authorize the use of force by
outside forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Duma, the lower house of the parliament, said last
week that any intervention by NATO would be viewed as "unlawful
aggression".
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke told the press that Solana and NATO European allied
supreme commander General Wesley Clark told him that "significant
military forces, regular forces and military uniformed police
remain in Kosovo" despite the fact that Belgrade insisted that its
offensive was over and its troops were pulling out.

BELGRADE, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir
Bulatovic on Monday warned that his country faced "imminent danger
of war" and must "defend itself by all available means if
attacked".
</P>
<P>
His address to the parliament came hours ahead of a crucial
U.N. Security Council meeting in New York at which
Secretary-General Kofi Annan was to submit a report on the
province where 90 percent of the population is ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
Annan's report is to focus on whether Belgrade has complied
with the September 23 U.N. Resolution 1199 on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Bulatovic pointed out that Annan's report was one-sided and
Yugoslavia maintained that the Kosovo crisis should be resolved by
political means.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the parliament to adopt legislation proposed by
his office for special funding "to defend the country".

<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain and China will hold a
series of exhibitions, question and answer sessions, symposiums,
and other activities over the next few months to promote astronomy
in the two countries, according to Anthony Sprake, an envoy at the
British Embassy in China.
</P>
<P>
The photo exhibition, "shooting stars", will be held in Beijing
through January of next year. Sprake said that that the photos
were shot by the British photographer David Malin, and will help
scientists and professionals as well as amateurs, especially young
people, appreciate and understand astronomy better.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and British have already been working together to
develop education materials and practical activities for young
people to observe the Leonid meteor shower, he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Meteorological Association said that China is the
best place to see the Leonid meteor shower, which is connected to
the Temple-Tuttle comet, on November 18.
</P>
<P>
Sprake said that astronomy contests are being organized in
China and the UK and British winners will come to China to see the
November meteor shower, while Chinese winners will go to the UK
next year to see an eclipse.
</P>
<P>
Some British scientists and their Chinese counterparts will
attend a symposium on astronomy and popular science in Beijing
this month.
</P>
<P>
David Malin has invented ways of extracting further information
from astronomical photos that has brought him international
fame. A new technique led to the discovery of an extremely faint
but massive galaxy in 1987 that was then named Malin-1.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is sponsored by Beijing's Ancient Observatory
and the Cultural and Education Section of the British Embassy in
China.

<HEADLINE> China's First Cooperative Law Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, Octorber 5 (Xinhua) -- The Li Guoji Law Office, in
the Heping Hotel on Shanghai's Bund, is only one of 400-some law
offices in Shanghai, but it is a milestone in the Chinese legal
system.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Li Guoji opened the first cooperative law office on
the Chinese mainland, focusing on economic law. The firm is now a
legal adviser for more than 400 foreign and domestic companies,
including some big ones like Matsushita Electric Works, Ltd. and
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Li was one among the first group of lawyers in China after 1949
and has witnessed many improvements in China's legal system. He
became a judge after graduation from Fudan University in
1952. When China reinstituted a lawyer system 4 years later, he
volunteered to go from being a judge to being a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
In 1957, he became famous overnight when he acted as defense
lawyer in a prominent case, but was labeled as a "Rightist" not
long afterwards and was sent to do manual labor in the countryside
for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, he returned to the Shanghai Higher People's Court and
became the first lawyer to resume work in China after the
"Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976). His elegant appearance and
eloquent speeches impressed audiences a great deal. The Japanese
consulate in Shanghai sent a copy of a TV program about him to
Japan with the title "Lawyers Reappear in China."
</P>
<P>
Li himself says, "My fate is tied to China's future. Since
China began the reforms and opening up in 1978, people have craved
democracy and a legal system and our lawyers have found plenty of
ways to serve the common folk."

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Panel Begins Considering Impeachment Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House Judiciary
Committee convened Monday to consider whether there is enough
evidence to open an impeachment inquiry against President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The panel began in closed session and then planned to open it
to the public for brief statements by all members and a summation
of the evidence by majority and minority counsel.
</P>
<P>
With the Republican majority on the panel supporting a
resolution to move ahead with the inquiry, the Democrats have
little chance to shape the outcome.
</P>
<P>
The hearing ends the review of evidence submitted by
Independent Council Cenneth Starr. It opens a path to an
impeachment inquiry that will enter the history books, along with
Watergate and the impeachment case against post-Civil War
President Andrew Johnson.

the largest in number among the subclans of Habar Gidir of
Hussein Mohamed Aidid, had had its inauguration postponed many
times.

cheering for the restoration of the law and prestigious Muslim
scholars.

new court, disclosed on the occasion that their first objective
is to eradicate the illegal roadblocks stretched along the

<P>
NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The rebels fighting to oust
President Laurent Kabila from power have announced a major
offensive on Kindu, capital of Maniema Province in the east of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Rebel-controlled radio Bukavu monitored in Cyangugu, Rwanda,
said Monday morning that the Congolese rebels arrived in the city
earlier than planned on Sunday, moving on three fronts, with the
ultimate aim of overruning it, the Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Intense fighting was signaled at the Kindu airport which hy5( 1M1%5P=BYAQUI@=
9ju{nday. But there has been no
independent confirmation of the capture.
</P>
<P>
Radio Bukavu further reported that Kindu had been chosen by
Kabila's loyalist forces and their allies as their general
headquarters from where they had been planning to launch a major
counter-offensive to retake the towns fallen to the rebels since
August 2, when the uprising started.
</P>
<P>
The reported attack on Kindu followed the seizure of a string
of towns near Kindu, notably Kalima, Ubundu, as well as Buta and
Isiro in Oriental Province last week.
</P>
<P>
The rebel officials had recently declared that the fall of
Bunia could trigger the surrendering of other towns and
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Kindu is a gateway to both Kasai provinces, known for being
rich in several minerals, notably diamonds. The next target
appears to be Lubumbashi, the second-largest city of the DRC.

<HEADLINE> HK Airline to Cease Chartered Flights in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's flagship airline,
Cathay Pacific Airways, will end its domestic chartered flights in
the Philippines Wednesday, the airline said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific announced the decision Monday after receiving
confirmation that Philippine Airlines, the country's leading
carrier, will resume its services this week.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong airline was asked to provide chartered domestic
services in the Philippines to fill the void left over by the
closure of the Philippine Airlines in late September.
</P>
<P>
When Cathay Pacific ceases its temporary operation Wednesday,
it will have provided a total of 60 chartered flights, linking key
cities in the Philippines. The last flight will leave Cebu for
Manila Wednesday evening, ten days after the Hong Kong airline
began offering services within the Southeast Asian country.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to be able to respond to President Estrada's
request to help the Philippines maintain aviation services in a
difficult time," said Philip Chen, Cathay Pacific's chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Airlines suspended its half-century operation on
September 23 after negotiations collapsed between the management
and the trade union on a recovery plan for the airline. It used to
handle about 80 percent of domestic flights and about 55 percent
of all passenger traffic in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific currently operates 38 international round-trip
flights a week between Hong Kong and the Philippines.

NEW DELHI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market Monday lost 224.22 points to
2,878.07 as against last week's close of 3,102.29 following the
panic selling by bulls and foreign institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
The national index also lost 95.50 points to 1,284.28 from
previous close of 1,379.78.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 and U.S. dollar index were quoted sharply lower at
299.93 and 117.66 points compared with previous close of 320.44
and 125.44 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The BSE market was hit hard following reports that Unit Trust
of India (UTI) has decided to sell four percent US-64 equity
holding in coming weeks and fresh crisis in Southeast Asian
markets. Operators lost confidence in the market and resorted to
heavy unloading Monday.
</P>
<P>
Equities suffered a record setback on BSE after a stock crash
earlier last year, which saw the market tumbling by over 302
points on March 31, 1997 when the Congress withdrew its support to
the Gujral coalition government in the country.

<HEADLINE> International Symposium On Iodine Deficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- An international symposium on
eliminating iodine deficiency disorders by the year 2000 opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing said that he is asking
government departments to increase preventive measures to lay a
solid foundation for the work, which is significant in improving
the health of Chinese and the global eradication of the disorder.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the then Chinese Premier Li Peng committed China to
eliminating the disorder by 2000 when he signed the "World
Declaration for the Survival, Protection and Development of
Children". Since then, iodized salt has become an effective and
easy way to stop the disorder.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization estimates there are more than 400
million Chinese living in areas with the iodine deficiency,
accounting for 40 percent of victims in the world.
</P>
<P>
Iodine deficiency can result in low levels of intelligence in
infants, children, and adolescents.
</P>
<P>
There are about six million babies born in iodine deficient
areas in China annually, who are believed to run the risk of
suffering from the disorder if it is not tackled soon.

<HEADLINE> EU: Ministerial Accession Negotiation Set for November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
on Monday that its enlargement process would enter a crucial phase
next month when accession negotiations rise to ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said that the
general affairs council meeting of EU foreign ministers agreed the
enlargement process should get substantive by November.
</P>
<P>
The council demanded that progress reports on the six applicant
countries already in accession talks be submitted for assessment
and approval as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the
15-nation EU, said the ministerial accession negotiations, due to
start on November 10, would be "really substantial."
</P>
<P>
There would be no ceremonial elements in the negotiations in
which seven of the 11 sets of accession requirements will be
discussed, said Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovenia and
Cyprus have each received 11 sets of accession requirements
ranging from infrastructure to democratization.
</P>
<P>
When asked if some of the easier-to-meet requirements could be
bypassed in the November negotiation, Schuessel said it was the
accession norm that no requirements be bypassed before the final
package could be made for enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Formal accession talks with the six countries began in March
this year.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Turkey are also
applying for EU membership.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Calls on Armed Forces to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Monday called on the Armed Forces (ABRI) to continue
fighting for the nation, and also anticipating the growth of
dangerous tendencies in society.
</P>
<P>
"The ABRI should maintain its role as a power the people could
rely on to solve the country's security problems," Habibie said
during the ABRI's 53rd anniversary celebration here.
</P>
<P>
To maintain this role, he said, the ABRI needs to change its
vision, mission, policies and strategies and to carry out its
duties, and it needs to be professional, effective, efficient and
modern.
</P>
<P>
"Only through these could the ABRI contribute its best to the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the dangerous tendencies growing in society, Habibie said,
"Such radical movements, which claim to be reform movements, are
slowly coming to the fore. Some leaders of these radical movements
have been planning to stage mass actions."
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the National Front, established on August 6,
agreed to mobilize the masses within 40 days in an effort to make
Habibie resign. The front, an association of retired generals and
officials, is led by prominent figures such as Lt. Gen. (ret.)
Kemal Idris, and has, since its inception, declared itself to be a
moral force and in opposition to Habibie.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Indonesian politicians, religious leaders
and observers expressed alarm at the weekend over the stated
support of the National Front for student activists' campaign to
force Habibie to resign.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after attending a ceremony marking the
ABRI's 53rd anniversary here Monday, ABRI Commander Gen. Wiranto
said the ABRI will take firm measures based on existing laws
against those who try or intend to frustrate the implementation of
the national agenda, including the holding of an extraordinary
session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) and general
elections.
</P>
<P>
He said the ABRI would be compelled to deal resolutely with
trouble-makers and rabble-rousers to protect the majority of the
more than 200 million Indonesian people.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the warning was directed at a group of retired
military officers, Wiranto said there were no accusations because
the most important thing now was how to conduct investigations and
examinations to arrive at conclusions about who they were.
</P>
<P>
Anyone, to whichever group he or she belonged, will be dealt
with firmly if he or she planned to frustrate the national agenda,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Falls on key Asian markets
triggered a weakening of Australian shares Monday, with trends
exaggerated by lower than usual volumes.
</P>
<P>
In the first day of trading after the Australian Liberal Party
and National Party coalition victory in the Australian federal
election, the all ordinaries index finished 16.6 points lower at
2,515.7, with a holiday in New South Wales state and some other
states resulting in volume levels being cut by about one third.
</P>
<P>
The local market opened stronger following Friday's rally on
Wall Street, but drops in the Japanese and Hong Kong markets meant
that soon gave way to negative sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The federal poll had little impact on trading on the bourse
overall, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index fell 35 points to 4,390.7, with the
banking sector lower by a similar quantum to the broader market.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank fell 24 cents to 19.44 Australian
dollars, Westpac bank dropped 2.8 cents to 9.01 Australian dollars
while Commonwealth Bank of Australia lost 42.3 cents to 18.495
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bucking the trend of the majors was ANZ bank, which rose seven
cents to 8.65 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index finished 0.6 points lower at 1,008.9,
with falls in diversified majors offsetting a strong rise in gold
stocks.
</P>
<P>
Resources giant BHP was down 10 cents at 11.70 Australian
dollars, global miner Rio Tinto fell 26.7 cents to 19.533
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index soared 48.8 points to 1,244.6 as the bullion
price added to its strength, improving 10 U.S. cents to 299.40
U.S. dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was 163.33 million shares at a value of 402.79 million
Australian dollars, with 395 falls, 373 rises and 326 steady.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar reacted
favorably to news of a victory of the coalition led by Prime
Minister John Howard in the federal election, with the currency
closing higher Monday in thin trading.
</P>
<P>
Although votes are still being counted, Prime Minister John
Howard claimed victory Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The local dollar closed at 59.88 U.S. cents from Friday's close
of 59.37 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
A coalition victory had been factored in by financial markets
but the local dollar still benefited from the win. Analysts had
suggested that a victory by the Australian Labor Party, which is
seen as being less market-friendly, could have put the local
dollar under pressure.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar was stronger against the Japanese yen, buying
135.05 from 134.71 previously.
</P>
<P>
The domestic currency was at 80.87 Japanese yen from Friday's
close of 80.04 yen and at 0.9777 German marks from 0.9807 marks.

Traders will be able to compare share prices with the previous
day's closing and read names of the companies involved in trading
as pronounced in Arabic but appearing in Latin figures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Those who obtain the new device will be able to check the lists
including names of companies, number of stocks and share prices,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to another project to furnish the clients with
the technical capacity to vocally inquire about trading by means
of telephone or pager at any time during the day.
</P>
<P>
But he said that securing such a service would not be an easy
task considering the fact that prices of traded stocks change in

<HEADLINE> Angola Blueprints Plan to Develop Sugar Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Ministry of Industry has
completed a plan to develop the country's traditional sugar
industry in a bid to increase domestic cane sugar supply and save
the precious foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be delivered to the ministerial meeting for
review and passage within this year, a source from the Ministry
of Industry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
At present, Angola's annual demand for cane sugar is 165,000
tons. However, the demand will rise to 225,000 tons in near
future, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The continued war in Angola has forced the country's only
sugar plant closed down in 1990, followed by suspension of sugar
cane plantation, leaving the country's sugar consumption to rely
fully on import.
</P>
<P>
Under the sugar industry development plan which is newly
completed, the sugar planting area in the country will reach
10,000 hectares within three years. Meanwhile, an investment of
60 million U.S. Dollars will help restore production in Dombe
Grande sugar plant in Benguela Province with an annual output of
80,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Industry show that a total of
100,000 tons of cane sugar was imported last year at the cost of
450,000 U.S. Dollars, still a far cry from the domestic demand.

ISLAMABAD, October 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. envoy on Afghanistan
Lakhdar Brahimi has invited high-ranking Taliban officials to come
to Islamabad for talks on ways and means to reduce the Iran-Afghan
border tension.
</P>
<P>
This was said Monday by acting chief of the U.N. Special
Mission to Afghanistan James Ngobi, according to the News Network
International.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi said Brahimi is arriving in Islamabad Thursday after
concluding his four-day visit to Iran. "Brahimi has no plan to
visit Afghanistan because of general embargo on U.N. officials by
the Secretary General (Kofi Annan) to visit the war-torn country,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi's statement came a day after Pakistan demanded that
Brahimi should visit Afghanistan if he wanted his trip to the
region to be meaningful.
</P>
<P>
"We want the U.N. envoy to visit Afghanistan and meet Taliban
leaders there," a senior Taliban representative based in Islamabad
said last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi said that it has not yet been decided as to whether or
not the U.N. envoy will visit other regional countries. Brahimi
will stay in Islamabad till he feels it necessary for his mission,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Taliban official for foreign affairs Abdul
Jalil, who visited Islamabad last week, discussed with the
Pakistani side matters relating to Brahimi's visit. However, no

Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Factories Making Way For More Residential Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Many of Shanghai's chimneys,
the longtime symbol of factories, have been demolished in urban
areas since the late 1980s to make way for more residential
housing and commercial buildings.
</P>
<P>
A thousand of the tall stacks have been destroyed and replaced
with an equal number of tall buildings, more than 70 percent of
which are residential buildings.
</P>
<P>
People in the Xinhualu Residential District used to suffer from
exhaust gas from nearby factories, but 70 percent of the factories
have been relocated and the people are now living in new high-rises
on the site of the factories.
</P>
<P>
One pharmaceutical factory that went back at least 89 years was
moved from the west part of Huaihai Road. The site is now used for
apartment or office buildings. The factory is now on a new
12-hectare site in the suburbs that is nearly 11 times the
original site.
</P>
<P>
Moving or closing the factories over the past decade has meant
a reduction of 180 million cubic meters of waste gas and 14 tons
of smog and dust daily in urban areas, according to Shanghai's
environmental protection department.
</P>
<P>
Some old factory sites are now being used for service trades
like real estate, trade, or finance that do not harm the
environment. Two-thirds of the city's factories are expected to be
relocated or shifted to service trades by the year 2010, and
service trades are expected to account for 60 percent of
Shanghai's GDP.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Palestinians held
demonstrations in the Gaza Strip Monday, demanding the release of
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that among the demonstrators were the
family members of the prisoners and the supporters of the Islamic
militant group Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, also
attended the rally, but did not address the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Under the interim peace agreements between Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority, Israel would release by stages
thousands of Palestinian prisoners held in its jails.
</P>
<P>
But since the peace process came to a halt in March last year,
Israel has slowed down the pace of release.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration came on the eve of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's arrival in the region.
</P>
<P>
Albright is due to meet separately on Tuesday with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser Arafat
in a bid to push forward the stalled peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Sub-Saharan Africa Marginalized from Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- "The World Development
Report 1998/99" issued by the World Bank Monday indicated that
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has generally been marginalized from the
telecommunication revolution.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, SSA had about 1.46 million working phone lines
serving a population of about 575 million, excluding South Africa
(with four million lines), said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the annual report noted that there has been a gradual
wave of reform in telecommunication in the SSA over the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 75 percent telephone lines in SSA are "private''
today, though the bulk of these are in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The report said ten countries, including Ghana, Senegal,
Uganda, Guinea, Cote D'ivoire and South Africa have privatized
national operators and 15 more countries, including Madagascar,
Cameroon, Tanzania and Malawi, intend to do so.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the proceeds of privatization amount to
approximately 1.7 billion U.S. Dollars with roll-out obligations
by companies of 3.8 million lines (4-6 billion U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Investment costs have decreased from 5,000 to 1,000 Dollars
per line. There has also been increasing choice with regard to
equipment, interconnection and international transmission
capacity. The cellular market, almost completely private,
comprises about 20 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
Though the Internet is growing quickly, access remains
limited, the report added, saying the opportunities for the
private sector during this liberalization phase are substantial,
especially with regard to cellular telephones, paging, voice-mail
and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, new communications technologies
(especially wireless and satellite) could accelerate SSA's
economic growth and poverty alleviation. Timely access to local
and international agricultural commodity price information, for
instance, could spur increased production and marketing by rural
farmers.
</P>
<P>
In telecommunications alone, investment totaling at least six
to eight billion Dollars would be required in SSA (excluding
South Africa) over the next four years to add an additional 4.5
million lines so as to achieve a minimum teledensity of one
percent (one line per 100 inhabitants) by 2001.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has been assisting in telecommunication
development in about 25 countries in SSA and is attempting to
establish clear links between its assistance to the sector and
poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
These initiatives include the African Virtual University
(AVU), Economic Toolkit and Workshops for Internet Connectivity
in Africa, the Rural Telecommunications Field Trial and
Commercialization Pilot in Kenya, and the Global Connectivity in
Africa Conference, according to the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's central bank has issued
a circular providing detailed guidelines for implementing new
rules that force some companies to sell at least 80 percent of
their foreign exchange earnings from current transactions to
banks, the Saigon Times daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The circular specifies that enterprises with government foreign
exchange guarantees must convert at least 80 percent of their
foreign funds in bank accounts into the local currency within 15
days of the money being deposited.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the circular states that non-productive
organizations will be required to sell all of their foreign
exchange holdings.
</P>
<P>
For foreign currency deposits made before September 12, the
deadline for selling the required amount to banks will be October
5.
</P>
<P>
The rules specify that banks are now responsible for
transferring the relevant deductible amounts into temporary
"controlling and holding" accounts pending the forex transaction
15 days later.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they must immediately inform their clients of
the foreign currency amounts to be sold so that the customers can
prepare paperwork.
</P>
<P>
Banks will be required to make daily reports to the state bank
on their forex transactions worth 50,000 or more following a
decision signed on September 29 by state bank governor Nguyen Tan
Dung.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Sanchez Hopes to Coach in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's former
international striker Hugo Sanchez said that he is dreaming to
coach in China and hopes to be a truth as earlier as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I want to be a coach as either the Chinese National Team or
one of the best clubs among the China soccer league," the retired
Mexican most prominent footballer told Xinhua on Sunday after a
draw ceremony for the 1999 Confederation Cup in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"I like China and visited the country in August," said
Sanchez, who quit his pro career on May 29, 1997. "I got to know
China's soccer as well as foreign coaches and players working
there."
</P>
<P>
He said China has showed its interest in his coaching
intention.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed as the "Soccer Prince" in Mexico, Sanchez lived up to
his fame in the Mexico World Cup in 1986, when the host team was
one of the quarterfinalists.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez came to the Spanish league in 1981 and made himself a
household name following his move from Athletics Madrid to Real
Madrid in 1985.
</P>
<P>
During his seven-season signing in Real, Sanchez was the five
consecutive top scorer in the league. He also made a record of 38
goals in the 1989-90 season.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Inflation Rate Eases Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' inflation rate
slowed down further to 10 percent in September from 10.5 percent
in August and 10.7 percent in July, the National Statistics Office
(NSO) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The NSO said the inflation rate continued dropping due to the
fall of prices of all other commodity groups except for fuel,
light and water.
</P>
<P>
By commodity group, the rate for fuel, light and water picked
up to 6.8 percent from 5.8 percent in August while those for food,
beverages and tobacco, clothing, housing and repairs, services and
miscellaneous items all plunged, the NSO said.
</P>
<P>
It added that by region, the inflation rate for Metro Manila
went up to 10.8 percent from 10.7 percent in August as the areas
outside Manila registered an average rate of 9.7 percent from
previous month's 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government planned a single-digit inflation
target for the whole year of 1998.

<HEADLINE> S. African Countries Urged to Strengthen Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries were
urged Monday to strengthen cooperation and reduce duty rates to
increase trade among them.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Jazzman Chikwakwa, Zambian Vice Minister
of Commerce, Trade and Industry during his speech at the fifth
meeting of the Inter-governmental Committee of Experts of the
U.N. Economic Commission for Africa and Sub-regional Development
Center for Southern Africa here in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Chikwakwa said African countries in general and southern
African countries in particular should seriously address and
deliberate on the question of increasing trade among them.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that most of Africa's exports are sent to
the European Union market under the Lome Convention duty free
arrangement which will cease in the year 2000, the official noted
Africa's exports will face higher landed costs and "stiff"
competition from mEteloped countries exporting to the same
market.
</P>
<P>
However, for trade among African countries to flourish, it is
important to level the playing field as far as imports and
exports within Africa and the sub-region are concerned, Chikwakwa
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that growth in intra-regional trade can only be
enhanced "if we keep our doors open and reduce effective duty
rates to levels which encourage fair competition."
</P>
<P>
Chikwakwa also laid emphasis on the need of mutual cooperation
to increase trade and develop the region's economies, saying that
through cooperation, trade relations can be strengthened and
trade or non-trade barriers can be reduced.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which started Monday under the theme "Cultivating
Effective Partnership in Southern Africa -- Development is
everybody's business", has attracted over 80 delegates.
</P>
<P>
They came from Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and
Zimbabwe and some Lusaka-based U.N. agencies as well as two main
regional bodies, the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern African
Countries (COMESA).

LUXEMBOURG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- European Union foreign
ministers decided on Monday against levying anti-dumping duties on
unbleached cotton imported from five countries in Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
The general affairs council meeting of the foreign ministers
failed to get the necessary majority to pass the proposal of the
European Commission for anti-dumping duties on imports from China,
Pakistan, Indonesia, India and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, Germany, Britain, Finland, Ireland, Sweden, Austria
and Greece were opposed to anti-dumping duties while Luxembourg
and Belgium abstained.
</P>
<P>
The remaining European Union nations were in favor of the
duties.
</P>
<P>
"It is very good news for the developing countries concerned
and underlines the British commitment to more liberal and fairer
world trade," said British Minister for Europe Joyce Quin.
</P>
<P>
The British government admitted that the decision by the
general affairs council meeting could save tens of thousands of
jobs in Britain alone.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, proposed a 10.9 percent duty on imports of unbleached
cotton from China, 11.1 percent on Pakistan, 13.7 percent on
Indonesia, 16.1 percent on India and 18.5 percent on Egypt.

JOHANNESBURG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's opposition
parties proposed Monday that talks with the government be
adjourned following claims that South African troops had stormed
the royal palace to flush out opposition supporters, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Southern African Development Community (SADC) commanders
reportedly replaced Botswana troops manning the palace with South
African troops. The opposition protested against the presence of
the South African troops at the palace, saying the troops were
not welcomed because they exacerbated tension.
</P>
<P>
Opposition supporters were at the palace before the bloody
conflict in Lesotho on September 22 to protest against the
results of the May general elections. The opposition claimed the
polls were rigged to prop up the government.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of rival opposition parties and the SADC
delegation arrived at the U.N. house in Maseru Monday for talks
aimed at breaking the political impasse.
</P>
<P>
Among others, the parties planned to discuss whether or not
Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili's government should
remain in power until fresh elections were held in 15 to 18
months.
</P>

During the talks, the government was reportedly firm in its

unity to run the country, while the opposition said it would

WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- With Congress poised to open the first Presidential
impeachment inquiry since the national agony of Watergate, the
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said Sunday that it was
his "hope and prayer" to complete the investigation of President
Clinton by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
-- Japan's top financial officials told their American
counterparts this weekend that their country's banking system was
acutely short of capital, with the top 19 banks in deeper trouble
than Tokyo has ever before admitted, according to officials
familiar with the discussions.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Forgetting about the Asian miracle, the Latin American
revival, the Russian transformation, the mighty American economy
and the triumph of free markets, the annual meeting this week of
central bankers, finance ministers and private financiers at the
International Monetary Fund and world Bank is about holding the
line and forestalling global economic disaster.
</P>
<P>
-- With reports of Turkish troops massed on Syrian's border,
President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus Sunday that Turkey
would not allow its neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. unveiled its plan to stanch the global economic
crisis, including a preapproved credit line for countries that
fall victim to investor panic despite sound economic policies. The
plan sharpens some old tools and offers new initiatives but adds
no new money to the crisis response beyond the already requested
funding.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. stock funds posted their worst quarter since 1990. The
average diversified U.S. stock fund posted a negative 15.02
percent return for the third quarter, according to Lipper
Analytical.

PHNOM PENH, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's three major
political parties held their second working session here Monday
afternoon to select a National Assembly president and nine
committee chairmen, but made no progress.
</P>

After more than two hours of talks, the working groups of the
three parties have not reached any agreement.
</P>
<P>
Both the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and the Funcinpec party

</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the Funcinpec and the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP)
also wanted to discuss the controversial seat-allocation formula,
amnesties for resistance generals such as Nhiek Bun Chhay and
Serey Kosal, and a halt to the threat against such opposition
figures as Kem Sokha.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sisovath Sirirath, representative of the Funcinpec, told
reporters after the meeting that the CPP insisted that Chea Sim,

<P>
The National Assembly session, which is scheduled to meet on
Wednesday, has to be delayed and the new date has not been fixed
at the meeting.

Cambodia held the National Assembly election on July 26. The
ruling CPP won 64 seats in the election, followed by the Funcinpec
party with 43 seats and the SRP with 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
Since the CPP does not have a two-third majority necessary for
forming a government alone, it has to form a coalition government
with other parliamentary parties.
</P>
<P>
But both the Funcinpec and the SRP refused to accept any offer
from the CPP. Instead they demanded that an investigation be
conducted into the alleged fraud of the CPP in the election.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk presided over an all-party crisis meeting
on September 22, which ended a three-week protest and brought the
rival parties back to the negotiation table on the formation of a
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The king arrived in Phnom Penh from Siem Reap Monday morning.
It is believed the king's stay in the country will help push the
formation of the new government as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> European Cancer Awareness Week for Men Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A major campaign to make men
more aware of the early signs and prevention of cancer got
underway in the European Union (EU), Norway and Iceland on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The slogan of the 1998 Europe Against Cancer Week is "If a
symptom persists, do not wait."
</P>
<P>
European men are advised to see their doctors bodily lumps,
sores which does not heal, a mole which changes in shape, size or
color, or any abnormal bleeding, persistent cough and hoarseness,
a change in bowel or urinary habits or an unexplained weight loss.
</P>
<P>
"Although these symptoms do not necessarily announce serious
illness, they have to be taken seriously as they could be signs of
a cancer that is developing," said Padraig Flynn, European Public
Health Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
He said that cancer could often be detected early if people
were aware of the warning signs.
</P>
<P>
Around 100,000 more men (or 25 percent more) than women die
from cancer each year in Europe, but a recent survey showed that men
are less concerned about early cancer detection or prevention.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 million posters and leaflets will be distributed
this week throughout EU member states, Norway and Iceland to raise
their awareness of early cancer detection and prevention.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU organized a special public information
campaign week last year to raise women's awareness of early cancer
detection and prevention.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of rival
Lesotho parties and the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) delegation Monday resumed their second round talks aimed
at breaking the political impasse in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
South African Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamady,
head of the SADC delegation, chaired the meeting, which was
expected to focus on whether or not Lesotho Prime Minister
Pakalitha Mosisili's government should remain in power until
fresh elections are held within 15 to 18 months, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho government and opposition parties reportedly have
agreed to hold a new general election within one year and half
while sharp differences still remain over many other issues.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Monday talks, the ruling Lesotho Congress for
Democracy (LCD) reiterated that it would not accept a proposal
for the formation of a temporary government of national unity,
while the opposition party alliance said they would accept
nothing less.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified sources were quoted as saying that a handful of
Lesotho opposition supporters carrying anti-South African banners
tried to hold demonstrations outside the United Nations House,
where the talks were being held, but they were soon removed by
the police.
</P>
<P>
The land-locked Lesotho has been in political crisis resulted
from allegations from opposition parties that the May 23 general
election was rigged in favor of the ruling LCD.
</P>
<P>
The SADC troops, consisting of soldiers of South Africa and
Botswana, have been deployed in the capital of Maseru, and
various part of the mountain kingdom for peacekeeping mission at
the invitation of the Mosisili government since September 22.

<TEXT>
<P>
CALCUTTA, India, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The 16th Congress of the
Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI (M)) opened here Monday
with over 600 delegates and representatives from 18 communist and
workers' parties abroad participating.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to review the party's work and
experience in the past three years and formulate a new strategy so
as to strengthen itself and unite all secular and democratic
forces to counter the challenges posed by the ruling Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) under the new situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the party's draft political resolution at the
inaugural session, General Secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet said
that the challenges posed by the BJP cannot be countered unless
all secular and democratic forces come together.
</P>
<P>
In his 90-minute speech, Surjeet criticized the BJP-led
coalition for the nuclear tests conducted in May this year, which
had soured India's relations with its neighbors and isolated India
in the world.
</P>
<P>
The party leader offered issue-based support to Congress party,
the biggest opposition party in the country, for forming an
alternative government at the center.
</P>
<P>
The offer is expected to be debated upon in the week-long party
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In its last congress meeting, the CPI (M) decided to keep an
equal distance from the BJP and the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Surjeet had said that although both the Congress and the BJP,
two national parties, were bourgeoisie and represented same class
interests, the BJP threatened to disrupt the unity of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has met or is well on
target in meeting 96 percent of the pledges it made in the past
year, a government report said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Progress Report of the SAR government
published Monday, of a total of 961 pledges the government made in
the past year, 922 have either been met or are well on target.
</P>
<P>
There are 39 undertakings, 4 percent of the total, fell behind
the schedule. The report identified clearly those undertakings and
explained the reasons for the shortfalls or delays and promised to
take all possible measures to catch up with these items.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the launch of the 1998 HKSAR Progress Report,
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan said that last year was a
challenging and difficult year for the Civil Service of the SAR as
it was for the community as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"The problems we had to grapple with were unprecedented and
their impact on the well-being of our community was widespread and
 severe," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Taking the "avian flu" for an example, Chan said, it is a new
strain of virus found in the human body and there is no previous
experience to draw on in combating it.
</P>
<P>
"We took decisive actions to prevent the possible outbreak of a
global epidemic," Chan said. At the end of 1997, some one million
chickens were destroyed in Hong Kong to prevent the possible
outbreak of the H5N1 virus.
</P>
<P>
When the Asian financial turmoil first began, no one could have
predicted its magnitude and contagion effects on the world
economy, Chan continued.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has not experienced such a severe economic adjustment
process in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
"In defending our financial and monetary systems we have taken
some controversial decisions, in particular the counter-measures
we carried out in August," she added.
</P>
<P>
In August the SAR government drew on its foreign exchange
reserves to counter-attack the speculators in the stock and
futures markets and enhanced the disciplines on operation of the
stock and futures markets.

"We understand of course that there is a price to pay but these
measures were generally endorsed by the community and there is a
growing body of international opinion supporting our move," Chan
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly we have learned from the experiences," Chan said. "We
in the Civil Service have to constantly remind ourselves that we
must always find better ways of doing things," she added.
</P>
<P>
"We must be sympathetic to the plight of the community,
continue to reach out and respond positively to the public's
growing aspiration and sharpen our crisis management skills," she
continued.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we are committed to an open, transparent and
accountable government," Chan stressed.
</P>
<P>
"It is in this same spirit of openness, transparency and
accountability that we continue to publish the Progress Report
setting out both our achievements and our failures for public
scrutiny," she added.
</P>
<P>
In two days' time, Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa will deliver
his second Policy Address. It is a usual practice in Hong Kong for
the government to publish the Progress Report reviewing the work
in the past year before the delivery of the Policy Address.

<HEADLINE> Former Nigerian Leader Receives Party Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Nigerian military leader
General Olusegun Obasanjo has received a membership registration
form from one of the political parties in the country but said he
will not fill it for now.
</P>
<P>
The registration form was presented to him Sunday at his
residence in Abeokuta, in southwestern Nigeria, by a delegation
of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) led by Deputy National
Chairman Chief Sunday Afolabi.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, who has been under amounting pressure to contend for
presidency as the new transition to civil rule program under
General Abdulsalam Abubakar unfolds, reportedly described the
situation as an "ambush".
</P>
<P>
He said it was a military common sense that it is safer to
move forward in an ambush than to retreat or stand still,
indicating that he might be willing to yield to the pressure.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said he will not fill the form for now,
because he need more time to reflect.
</P>
<P>
The former leader said he will travel out to the United States
and Scandinavian countries and would give appropriate response on
his return, after due consultations, reflections and mediations.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, who took office as a military leader in 1976, handed
over to elected civilian president Alhaji Shehu Shagari in 1979.
</P>
<P>
He is the only one of the Nigeria's many military leaders who
kept his promise to hand over a civilian regime.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo was released from jail earlier this year by Abubakar.
He was put in jail in 1993 for alleged involvement in a coup plot
to overthrow late military leader General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the form to Obasanjo, the PDP Deputy National
Chairman Afolabi urged Obasanjo to make himself available to lead
the country, especially "at this critical moment of our nation's
history."
</P>
<P>
He said the party was motivated by "our belief that Nigeria
deserves a leader who is a fair player, who can build a bridge of
understanding across all the divides of our national policy and
hence construct a structure of peace for progress on the rubbles
of our past failures."

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Share prices ended lower on
the Singapore Stock Market Monday after the G-7 countries make
commitment to strong economic growth but no joint action.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) lost 16.13 points to
883.86 points.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover was 89.76 million units valued at 119.03
million Singapore dollars (about 70.65 million U.S. dollars).
Decliners outstripped advancers by 148 to 48 while other 226 were
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Asean topped the gainers of the day with a rise of 30 cents to
4.10 U.S. dollars at close. Boustd S moved up 25 cents to 0.95
Singapore dollars. Ayimp edged up ten cents to end at 2.39
Singapore dollars.

<P>
On the downside, SPH led the descents of the day with a drop of
80 cents to 12.90 Singapore dollars. Creative 50 lost 30 cents to
finish at 15.00 Singapore dollars. Times Pub shed off 50 cents to
1.93 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the Group of Seven failed to inspire the market
and the outcome of the G-7 meeting could not ease investors' fear
of a global recession.
</P>
<P>
During the week-end G-7 meeting, the world's richest nations
acknowledged the risk of economic contagion sweeping into their
own countries and have stressed their commitment to keep their
economies on a strong growth path. But they made it clear there
was little likelihood of any unified action on their part.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the U.S. proposed that the IMF set up an
emergency lending fund while Japan unveiled a 30 billion U.S.
dollar plan for crisis-hit Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
The dealers remained skeptical if the proposal would work in
the effort for a turnaround in the region.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Needs No Short-term Foreign Investments in Stock Market: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Monday it
would continue to encourage capital inflows, but not the
short-term investment in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
"We will make a distinction between foreign short-term
investment in the stock market and investments in productive
capacities such as manufacturing," Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said when opening the Japan Departmental Stores
Association conference here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Stock market investments are mainly for capital gains and
capital gains are not taxed. Besides, they can easily destroy the
economy by pulling out and taking their money and profits with
them. ...we can do without the dubious benefit of foreign direct
investment in the stock market," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
However, Malaysia welcomes long-term direct foreign investments
in manufacturing as it would help the country's industrialization
program, Mahathir said, assuring foreign investors that they will
gain much by investing in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He said that through foreign investments Malaysia had now
become a more affluent society with high-purchasing power and this
had resulted in Malaysia becoming a good market for foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
It has always been the policy of the Malaysian government to
welcome foreign investment, particularly long-term investments
that would benefit both foreign investors and locals, the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the policy of encouraging foreign investment was
reflected in the continuing keen interest shown by investors in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, a total of 759 projects with a total capital
investment of 7.4 billion U.S. dollars were approved with 44
percent coming mainly from the United States, Japan, Germany and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Out of the applications received, Mahathir said 462 or 61
percent were for new projects while 297 were from existing
investors who proposed to expand and diversify their existing
operations in Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Get 0.25 Mln Dollars from FAO for Seed Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will get 0.25 million
U.S. dollars from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for
emergency supply of vegetable seeds to flood-affected farmers.
</P>
<P>
An agreement in this regard was signed in Dhaka Sunday, said an
FAO statement reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The amount will cover the procurement and distribution of
approximately 25 tons of improved variety of vegetable seeds for
distribution to the most vulnerable flood-affected families.
</P>
<P>
In view of the emergency requirement of the vegetable seeds,
the procurement of the seeds has already been initiated and the
improved variety of vegetable seeds will be ready for distribution
to the flood-hit people on October 10.
</P>
<P>
The project will also provide technical advisory services with
the appointment of national consultants for the production of
vegetables under post-flood condition.
</P>
<P>
This emergency assistance project would help the flood-affected
farmers to restore their agricultural production as well as earn
an income, the FAO said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The flooding, which had lasted for ten weeks starting from
mid-July and was the worst ever in a century, had gripped as much
as two-thirds of the country and affected about half of its 127
million people. It also left over 1,000 people dead and caused an
estimated loss of 3.4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Syria Hopes for Peaceful Solution to Row With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Syria hopes that its current
difference with Turkey can be solved through diplomatic channels,
Syrian Vice President Zuhair Masharqa said on Monday in an
interview with an Egyptian radio.
</P>
<P>
Strained ties between Mideast neighbors Syria and Turkey
deteriorated in recent weeks. Turkey condemned Damascus for its
allegedly aiding Kurdish rebels' activities in Turkey, while Syria
bridled at Turkey's growing military links with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey reportedly massed heavy troops along the border with
Syria. But tension eased a bit following announcements of both
sides for a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
"Syria has exerted serious efforts to talk Turkey into
following up a constructive dialog as to find satisfactory
settlement to the bones of contention between the two countries,"
Masharqa said in an interview over the telephone from Damascus
with the Voice of Arabs radio.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt and Syria sustain coordination at all times
to serve the interests of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
"Logic and international law must govern the dialog between the
Syrian and Turkish sides. We hope for a diplomatic solution
especially in view of the mediation efforts (Egyptian) President
Hosni Mubarak is exerting between the two countries," Masharqa
said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made a lightning visit to the Syrian capital and is
expected to make another trip to Ankara to head off the
development of tension into an armed confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Recent tension caused by the "aggressive" statements of the
Turkish military and political officials was among the topics
discussed by Mubarak and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad Sunday,
according to Masharqa.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said on Saturday that
Turkey plans a military exercise along the Syrian border after the
end of current NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) exercises
in the area.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also announced plans for fresh naval maneuvers in the
eastern Mediterranean and joint air exercises, which Syria says
directed against itself.

WELLINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is likely to have
an 80 million NZ dollar (40 million U.S. dollar) drop in wool
income this selling season, New Zealand Herald reported recently.
</P>
<P>
The Auckland-based newspaper quoted the chairman of the NZ Wool
Board, Bruce Munro, as saying that it had been thought that
average prices of wool might rise from 450 cents a kilogram last
season to 465 cents.

"But it is reasonably clear that won't be achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
A 15 percent drop in prices to an average of 415 cents a
kilogram was more likely which would reduce export earnings from
wool to under 900 million NZ dollars (450 million U.S. dollars)
annually, Munro predicted.
</P>

Lower demand for high quality clothing from Asian customers was
 already having a strong influence, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak to Visit Ankara on Turkey-Syria Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
will visit Turkey Tuesday to seek ways to defuse the on-going
crisis between Turkey and Syria, a Turkish foreign ministry
spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, Necati Utkan added "there is not a designation for
mediator. For mediation, the two sides have to assign a mediator."
</P>
<P>
"Does Syria announce that Egypt is her mediator? Then why do we
have to make such a statement?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the hope for a diplomatic solution to the crisis
has not come to an end, Utkan said: "We will listen to President
Mubarak. We expect President Mubarak to bring us information or at
least impression."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has stepped up its accusation of Syria's alleged support
to the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been
fighting since 1984 for autonomy in southeastern Turkey. Tensions
mounted after Ankara reportedly massed troops along borders with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
And Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliance
with Israel, saying that it threatens Arab security and
undermines Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the
Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Foreign Workers Apply for Work Permits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of foreign workers have
rushed to labor and immigration departments to legalize their
status in Jordan, since the government began a crackdown on
illegal guest workers last Wednesday, the semi-official Jordan
Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed a large increase in the number of people
showing up at our offices to obtain work permits," Secretary
General of the Ministry of Labor Saleh Tarawneh was quoted as
saying. He refused to disclose the figures in detail.
</P>
<P>
The roundup of hundreds of guest workers, mainly Asians, in
the past days has caused panic among others, who hurried to apply
for work permits to avoid being detained, said Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
Police detained the Asians to check their working status. Those
without valid permits will be prosecuted or deported.
</P>
<P>
As to the illegal Arab workers in the kingdom, the government
will regulate them at a later stage. By doing so, it intends to
give them some time to legalize their status, thus avoiding
possible disputes with the countries they come from.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 to 500,000 guest workers now live in Jordan,
the bulk of whom are from Egypt, Syria and Iraq. Only 40
percent of the total hold valid work permits.
</P>
<P>
The government's effort to regulate the labor market is aimed
at creating jobs for locals.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Egypt to Go Nuclear if Threatened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has said that Egypt will join the nuclear club and retaliate in
kind if it is threatened by Israel, an Arabic-language newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We do not at present think of entering the nuclear club
because we do not want war. War does not solve any difference.
Still peace needs power to protect," he said in an interview with
the mass-circulated "Al-Hayat."
</P>
<P>
"We are not in a hurry (to acquire nuclear arms)...But if the
time comes when we need the nuclear weapon, we would not
hesitate...This is the last thing on our mind," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently ascribing the possibility of Egypt's going
nuclear to the threat from Israel, which is believed to be the
only nuclear power in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"When we talked with the Israelis about this issue before the
(Israeli) present government took over, their view was to open all
files after reaching peace. But (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin
Netanyahu is not a man who has fought and does not know what war
means," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader said that it is easy to have access to
nuclear weaponry materials. "India and Pakistan have launched
nuclear blasts. And Iran is said to be on the road. Every country
is ensuring itself a deterrent weapon that can preserve its safety
and protect its entity."
</P>
<P>
Since early 1990s, Mubarak has been calling for freeing the
Middle East from the weapons of mass destruction. In the wake of
the tit-for-tat nuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan
last May, Mubarak suggested that the weapons of mass destruction
be phased out from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader gave the interview on the occasion marking
the 25th anniversary of the October war, when the Egyptian army
took Israeli forces by surprise and crossed the Suez Canal, which
Israel had held since capturing Egypt's Sinai peninsula in the
1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians were later pushed back, but Arab's first and
initial victory erased the shame of the 1967 defeat and allowed
Egypt to move toward peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Egypt and Israel have been rather cool despite
that Egypt became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty
with Israel in 1979.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Increased fears over the world
economy brought Monday the benchmark Nikkei index of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange below 13,000 for the first time since January 1986.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of those listed at the exchange lost 275.57 points, or
2.08 percent, from last Friday's close to end at 12,948.12.
</P>
<P>
The last time the Nikkei average closed below 13,000 was on
January 30, 1986, when it finished at 12,949.04.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all First Section
issues, dropped 17.33 points, or 1.71 percent, to 996.69, ending
the day below 1,000 for the first time since November 20, 1985.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section was down to an estimated 370
million shares from Friday's 516 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB) was the day's volume
leader.
</P>
<P>
Share prices of export-oriented blue chips plunged in the day,
reflecting the market's concern about possible economic slow-down
in the United States and Europe, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Several high-tech shares marked new lows for the year, due to
uncertainty over the future course of overseas economies.

exceeded gainers 818 to 319, with 157 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Intermarriage Can End Ethnic Strife in Burundi: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Vice President Specioza
Kazibwe has suggested intermarriage between the Hutu and Tutsi
for ending the deep-rooted tribal strife in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
She offered this advice when meeting members of the Burundi
women's peace initiative in Mukono, 20 km east of Kampala, over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Monitor paper quoted the senior official as saying
that this is one of the effective ways of ending this ethnic
problem and saving the country from ethnic bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
She was quick to add that tribes are not really the problem.
</P>
<P>
It is individual greed for power which certain politicians use
to divide people so they may achieve their selfish objectives,
she said, adding that some politicians in Uganda used religion to
achieve the same.
</P>
<P>
The guests were also encouraged to wrest men from power
because she held that it's men who have driven the region into
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
A lot of blood has been shed in the Great Lakes Region and
Africa in general, she said, adding that these wars have been
initiated without consulting women and in the end women suffered
most.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Talks Hit Obstacle: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The second round of talks
on Lesotho's political impasse Monday appears to be headed for a
stalemate as rival parties disagree on who should run the country
before a fresh general election, South African media reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) and opposition
parties agreed Friday that a new election would be held in 15 to
18 months.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties insist that an interim government of
national unity should be installed to govern the country while
the LCD rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Deputy Prime Minister Kelebone Maope said Sunday that
his party would not back down on this issue, according to The
Star newspaper.
</P>
<P>
By calling for an interim coalition government, the opposition
parties were asking the ruling party to effect a coup and his
party was not prepared to do that, he said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Basotho National Party leader Everestus Sekhonyane
said their demand was based on the understanding that the army
and the police would need to be restructured before new elections
were held. That task could not be left in the hands of one party,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mamello Morrison, spokeswoman for an alliance of five
opposition parties, said they would insist on an interim
government of national unity at Monday's talks.
</P>
<P>
"We have not lost sight of our fundamental belief that there
is no way one single party can assist the country to move ahead.
We are still going to insist on that position. We hope the other
side will begin to see the validity of this."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the talks could break down over this issue, she said
differing views need not lead to a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties also spoke out strongly against the
proposal that South African and Botswana troops remain in Lesotho
until after the new election.
</P>
<P>
The Citizen quoted opposition spokesmen as warning that
popular feeling against especially the South African contingent
was running high with allegations of harassment of local women by
troops and even of rape abounding.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether order and stability could be maintained if the
troops were withdrawn immediately, she said Lesotho had been
maintaining law and order without them.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, opposition parties slammed Mbeki for his
premature announcement that agreement had been reached on who
would rule the kingdom before the election.
</P>
<P>
The communication division in Mbeki's office described the
gaffe in a statement as "an honest mistake" which had occurred as
a result of faulty communication between his communication
division inside and outside Lesotho.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urged to Support Syria in Standoff With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A number of political parties and
local mass media have demanded the Jordanian government to fully
support Syria in its current standoff with Turkey, the
semi-official Jordan Times reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the centrist National Constitutional Party (NCP)
Khaldoun Nasser was quoted by the paper as saying late Sunday that
his party asks the government to take a pro-Syrian stand,
especially when tension amounts.
</P>
<P>
The NCP also calls for the government to work against any
alliances in the region, particularly if they are aimed at an
Arab country, said Nasser, adding that a perceived Turkish-Israeli
military alliance is widely thought as targeting Syria and
standing behind the current Turkish-Syrian crisis.
</P>
<P>
The leftist People's Democratic Party (Hashd) also urged the
government to give Syria unequivocal support.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the Jordanian government to respond to these
(Turkish) threats by announcing its support for its Arab brothers
in Syria and Iraq," the paper quoted a Hashd statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Action Front (IAF), a major opposition party,
echoed the calls of the NCP and the Hashd.
</P>
<P>
IAF Secretary General Abdul Latif Arabiyat told the paper that
the kingdom is duty-bound to support Syria. However, he insisted
on a peaceful solution to the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Renowned newspaper columnist Fahed Fanek late Saturday told
the Al Ra'I, a leading Arabic daily in Jordan, that "we can only
be on the Arab side" and Turkish threats to an Arab country are
"absolutely unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arabic daily Al Arab Al Yawm's Chief Editor Saleh
Qallah said that "we can only stand with Syria if Turkey attacks
it. On this matter, there is no discussion."
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has so far steered clear of taking
side in the Syrian-Turkish crisis. It called for both sides to
conduct constructive dialog to contain the crisis and find a
proper settlement for their disputes.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom faces difficult situation on this issue, as it has
strained relations with Syria but enjoys close military and
political ties with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's military top officials last week manifested that
their country is in a state of undeclared war with Syria due to
Damascus' alleged support for Kurdish rebels.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Increase Knowledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- African countries are urged
"to do much more, much faster, to increase their knowledge base,
to invest in educating their people, and take advantage of the
new technologies for acquiring and disseminating knowledge".
</P>
<P>
The call came from "The World Development Report, 1998/99"
with the theme of "knowledge for development", which was released
Monday by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The report warned that "countries that postpone this will fall
behind those that move faster, and the unhappy consequences for
their development will be hard to remedy."
</P>
<P>
The report quoted African ministers, who attended the "African
Telecom '98 Forum" in Johannesburg, South Africa, in May 1998 as
saying that the lack of "policies that promote equitable public
participation in the information society as both producers and
consumers of information and knowledge" makes it difficult for
African countries to share the benefits of the current global
communication revolution.
</P>
<P>
Given that more than 60 percent of the people of Africa live
in rural areas, the ministers identified the development of
telecommunications infrastructure in rural areas as one of the
biggest challenges facing Africa and which deserves priority
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The report noted the remarkable achievement made in the
effective use of knowledge for development as can be seen in west
Africa, where epidemiological and pharmaceutical knowledge made
possible the near total eradication of river blindness.

<P>
According to the report, over 30 million people are now
protected from infection in 11 countries (Ghana, Burkina Faso,
Cote d'ivoire, Guinea, Togo, Benin, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone,
Senegal and Guinea Bissau) and 185,000 people have been spared
the disability of blindness. A total of 25 million hectares of
fertile land is now available for settlement and cultivation.
</P>
<P>
In agriculture, the report observed that extension program are
most likely to success if they use existing channels of
information transmission.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of 676 farmers in seven districts in Kenya
indicated that 39 percent of farmers attributed their awareness
of improved practices to their neighbors and other farmers, and
only 25 percent to extension workers.
</P>
<P>
This year's report focused on the role of knowledge in
advancing economic and social well being, saying "because
knowledge matters, understanding how people and societies acquire
and use knowledge -- and why they sometimes failed to do so -- is
essential to improving people's lives, especially the lives of
the poorest among us."
</P>
<P>
There is large disparity between developed and developing
countries in the capacity to create knowledge, said the report.
This gap still persists and has been growing bigger partly
because developed countries spend more money on research and
development than developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Capital accumulation has long been regarded as the main
determinant of growth. However, the report recognized that
knowledge, not capital, is the key to sustained social and
economic development.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's new cabinet list
received royal approval Monday, indicating the end of the latest
major cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Some 17 positions of ministers and deputy ministers were
involved in the reshuffle, the first of its kind of the Chuan

</P>
<P>
As television station Channel 9 reported Monday, six of the

The reshuffle was characterized by the entry of Chart Pattana
Party (CPP), the third largest political party in Thailand, and
aimed to strengthen the majority of the ruling coalition in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
With CPP's 51 seats in the 389-strong lower house, supporters
of the ruling coalition will hold 257 seats, leading a comfortable
majority over the 132-seat opposition.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government now consists of the Democrat Party,

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bomb Aid not Enough: Kenyan Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya
Godana has told U.S. officials that a proposed relief worth 50
million U.S.Dollars for Kenya and Tanzania, which suffered bomb
raids aimed at American embassies, is not adequate.
</P>
<P>
The East African weekly reported Monday that Godana conveyed
this message to the U.S. State Department and senators during his
visit to Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
Bombing-related losses in Nairobi alone had been estimated at
500 million Dollars. The 50-million-Dollar relief initiative for
Kenya and Tanzania "does not come anywhere close" to what's
needed, Godana was quoted as saying in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"There is tremendous public expectation in Kenya that
sufficient help will be forthcoming," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. President Bill Clinton called for emergency aid
to the two east African countries in response to the August 7
bombing which killed more than 250 people and injured about 5,000
others.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. funding proposal is being presented to Congress as
part of a 1.8-billion-Dollar package aimed primarily at improving
security at U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide.
</P>
<P>
About 200 million Dollars of the total sum is earmarked for
construction of new embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam and
for provision of temporary diplomatic services.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Warning to Syria Aimed at Eliminating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's strong warning to Syria
is aimed at nothing but eliminating the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) based in Damascus, local Daily News said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The influential newspaper quoted reliable officials, whose
names were not given, as saying that the Turkish government
regards Syria's support for the PKK as the only stumbling block in
Turkey's final victory against the organization.
</P>
<P>
The official sources' remarks came when Turkey and Syria are
engaged in a war of words over the allegation. In a rising
tension, Turkey reportedly massed heavy troops along the border
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
They said Turkey has cut down the PKK presence in northern Iraq
to a minimum level thanks to the cooperation with Iraq's Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) led by Massoud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and his men
are given shelter by the Syrians, an allegation which has been
denied by Syria.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said Sunday that Turkey is
sending a warning not only to Syria, but the world because
everybody knows that "Turkey has suffered from separatist
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Over 37,000 people including PKK rebels, civilians and the
government troops, have been killed in conflicts since the PKK
started a separatist campaign for autonomy in southeast Turkey
in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Investment in Uganda Slashed Due to Insecurity: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- New investments in Uganda have
slashed in the first eight months of this year due to increased
media coverage of rampant insecurity and implementation of new
tax regulations.
</P>
<P>
There are altogether 100 new projects registered during this
period, the first big slump since the country directed its
attention to foreign investors seven years ago, the Nairobi-based
East African weekly paper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there has been a month-to-month decline
in the first eight months of this year, with August serving as
the bottom. There were only eight projects registered in the
month.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, a total of 61 projects worth 114.521 million
U.S. Dollars were licensed in July and August of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed this plummet to widespread reports of
rebel activities in the northern and western parts of the
country. It is these reports that have scared the investors
away, it said.
</P>
<P>
Other factors like the new tax regulations are also cited as
leading to the fall. Recently, the Ugandan government scrapped
an unpopular package that offered investors up to six years' tax
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are now allowed to pay a 75 percent
depreciation allowance on machinery and plants set up in the
rural areas. The rate decreases to 50 percent if the projects are
in the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
To minimize the influence of reported insecurity on the inflow
of foreign capital, the Uganda Investment Authority has decided
to counter negative publicity about rebel activities by using the
Internet to disseminate information about the government's fresh
security efforts and preferable policies for investors.

was making his Nuveen Tour debut, won 25,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that was one of the better matches I've played in the
last six years," said Connors. "It was one of those days when I
was seeing the ball well and hitting everything cleanly."
</P>

In the doubles final, Howard Herr and Ned Caswell failed in

BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- More than a dozen agricultural
experts from countries in the Asia-Pacific Region, including
China, the United States, Japan, India and Australia are in
Beijing, the Chinese capital, to discuss the sustainable
development of agriculture and scientific cooperation in the
region.
</P>

The Chinese government has focused on environmental protection
throughout the nation's dramatic economic growth cycle, and has
basically succeeded in reversing rapid environmental
deterioration. According to CAST President Zhou Guangzhao, who
also serves as vice chairman of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
However, China continues to face pressing environmental
issues. Heavy summer flooding has mainly been attributed to
abnormal weather, and inappropriate human activities have hindered
sustainable development, according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He added that China should take the lead in introducing new
modes of production and lifestyles to save valuable resources and
protect the environment.

<HEADLINE> 21 Trafficked Children Recovered in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one trafficked children,
aged between five and 15, along with four women were recovered by
police in a hotel here in a pre-dawn swoop on Sunday, press
reports here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police also arrested four persons from the same hotel for their
alleged involvement in attempting to traffic these children and
women to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
All the children and women were inhabitants of the country's
southern district of Cox's Bazar.
</P>
<P>
The four arrested persons belong to an organized gang of
international women and children traffickers who assembled the
women and children at the hotel during the last month by alluring
them with better jobs in Saudi Arabia, police sources were quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The arrested persons told the police that the women and
children were brought from Cox's Bazar to Dhaka by one man and
several others. But the police could not arrest the other
traffickers as they were outside the hotel during the raid. The
case is being investigated.
</P>
<P>
Over 200,000 Bangladeshi women and children have been
trafficked to the Middle East and India in the past 20 years, and
about 20,000 Bangladeshi women are involved in prostitution in
Indian brothels alone, according to reports of human rights
organizations and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government is deeply concerned about the
growing trend in women and children trafficking and has taken a
series of measures in this regard.

PYONGYANG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- An official newspaper of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Sunday criticized the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for urging the country
to carry out comprehensive implementation of the nuclear assurance
accord.
</P>

A commentary in the Rodong Sinmum said the DPRK would take
nuclear measures under agreements with the United States, which
promised to build new light-water reactors for the DPRK, not under
the IAEA's nuclear assurance accord.
</P>
<P>
With the light-water reactors not yet built, the IAEA's demand
for "checks of nuclear facilities" and its urge for the DPRK "to
implement the nuclear assurance" are simply ridiculous, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The article said the IAEA had better stand aside and watch the
DPRK and the U.S. implement the agreements reached between them,
because the DPRK has not forgotten the IAEA's hostilities towards
it in the past.

respectively.

people had been killed.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that eight people have been found dead in
similar circumstances in Jember regency recently.
</P>
<P>
Banyuwangi is a regency 280 kilometers east of East Java's
capital of Surabaya with a population of 1.5 million people. The
regency capital, Banyuwangi, is a coastal town. Jember is about
105 kilometers west of Banyuwangi.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports from Banyuwangi said the targeted victims had
initially been those believed to be "black magic practitioners" as
were the victims in Jember and Madura. However, according to
community leaders, most of the later victims were reportedly
Muslim preachers.
</P>
<P>
Some believe that they are revenge killings while others are
speculating on possible "political motives."
</P>
<P>
Banyuwangi and Jember are predominantly Muslim areas rooted in
the tradition of Nadhlatul Ulama, which is the country's largest
Muslim organization.
</P>
<P>
One military source suggested that the killings were a
deliberate attempt to create tension between Nadhlatul Ulama and
members of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) led by Megawati
Soekarnoputri, daughter of the country's founding president,
Soekarno.
</P>
<P>
The Megawati-led PDI will hold its congress in Bali this week
and thousands of supporters are expected to make their way to
Banyuwangi port en route to the island resort.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Megawati-led PDI will set up a
coalition with Nadhlatul Ulama to contest next year's general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Head of the regional branch of Nadhlatul Ulama, Kyai Haji
Hasyim Muzadi, said it was obvious that the killers were
well-organized and very professional.
</P>
<P>
"These mysterious people usually come in one to three trucks
each carrying about 40 people who are not locals," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to stop the mysterious wave of grisly murders, police,
troops in armored cars and frightened residents armed with knives
and sharpened sticks patrolled the streets of Banyuwangi on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
East Java Military Commander Maj. Gen. Djoko Subroto had denied
any involvement of his personnel in the murders.
</P>
<P>
East Java police chief Maj. Gen. Moch. Dayat told reporters
that 100 elite Mobile Brigade personnel had been deployed as an
anti-guerrilla force in the affected areas. The police had
arrested 58 suspects, including three thought to have been paying
the killers.
</P>
<P>
"We'll arrest the mastermind eventually (after investigating
these suspects)," he added.

BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The agricultural sector in
Beijing, the Chinese capital, plans to introduce a new variety of
watermelon seeds to replace the popular Jing Xin No.1 variety
currently in production.
</P>
<P>
Some 747 seeds sent into space over a 15 day period two years
ago were subjected to radiation in a vacuum environment basically
free of gravitational forces, according to today's edition of
the Beijing Morning Post.

Experts from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and
Beijing Municipal Academy of Agricultural Sciences introduced the
new melon variety to the market during this year's National Day

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has not
changed its original plan to call an early election before the end
of its term in office, government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Akapol was quoted Monday by the Bangkok Post as saying a
cabinet reshuffle with the inclusion of the Chart Pattana Party
does not mean that the government intends to fulfill its tenure.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet reshuffle list has been completed and it is
expected to be announced Monday, according to Visanu Kreuangam,
cabinet secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Once the ailing economy has recovered to a certain level and
the Election Commission is ready, an election will be held, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is determined to carry on three major
tasks -- to try to revive the economy, to restructure the
financial, banking and real sectors, and to carry out bureaucratic
reform.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the government has so far managed to restore
economic stability to a certain level and to restore confidence in
the economy in spite of obstruction from external factors.
</P>
<P>
He said restructuring of the financial, banking and real
sectors which has already started would be carried on while the
bureaucratic system would undergo reform to make it more
transparent and more responsive to public aspirations.
</P>
<P>
"The government cannot survive only votes in parliament. It
has to earn the faith and trust of the people," he said.

FUZHOU, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The city of Wuyishan in east
China's Fujian Province recently decided to tear down a three-star
hotel to preserve the uniqueness of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
The city, known for its picturesque Wuyi Mountains, plans to
remove the building from 6,000 square meters of land to return it
to trees and grass as an example of Fujian's environmental
protection program.
</P>
<P>
Fujian's capital, Fuzhou, has spent a large amount of money on
160 hectares of green land and the Provincial Planning Commission
recently canceled a project so that it could protect 32.7 hectares
of mangrove trees.
</P>
<P>
In July, Governor He Guoqiang signed a contract on
environmental protection for the next three years with mayors and
prefectural commissioners of the province's nine cities and
prefectures to get the province's industries that are polluters to
meet state standards by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has raised 1 billion yuan (120 million U.S. dollars) for
environmental improvement since 1996. In 1997, it improved 488
production lines in 213 factories as part of the move and reduced
discharged waste gas by more than 2,400 tons.

<HEADLINE> Marine Biota in Indonesian Sulawesi Faces Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Some Indonesian non-governmental
organizations feared that various marine biota in Central Sulawesi
province will become extinct as many fishermen use explosives and
poisonous chemicals to catch fish, Antara News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of Indonesian Environmental Forum Office in
Central Sulawesi Harli said the bombings have caused damage to
coral reefs and the community of Napolean and Kerapu fish in the
waters of the Togean islands.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the Togean islands is one of the areas in the world
which has the most beautiful coral reefs, including the Atoll
(ring-shaped coral) and the Patch Reef (which stretches along an
unbroken length)," Harli said.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the provincial fishery service Faizal Shahab also
expressed concern about the fish bombings, saying the fishermen's
misconduct would reduce the population of fish.
</P>
<P>
"Not only big fish like Napolean, Kerapu, or even Lobster, but
also small fish will die," he said.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the fish bombings, Shahab said, the fishery
service is cooperating with the Natural Resources Conservation
Board to conduct sea patrols on the islands.
</P>
<P>
However, the patrols have not yet achieved the maximum result
due to limited personnel and supporting facilities, such as
speedboat.
</P>
<P>
He feared that Central Sulawesi's marine potentials will
gradually deplete due to the improper exploitation of marine
biota.
</P>
<P>
Now, local fishermen have difficulties catching Napolean fish
in the 168,443-hectare conservation area, he added.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Dumping Rules Unavoidable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to impose
anti-dumping regulations on imported chemical fibre products,
today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Anti-dumping regulations have become unavoidable, since
imported products have severely disordered the domestic chemical
fibre market, said Xu Kunyuan, vice-director of the State Textile
Industry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
China imported 837,000 tons of chemical fibres in the first
half of this year, 37.4 percent of the total domestic
output in the same period, according to the Association of the
Chemical Fibre Industry.
</P>
<P>
Consecutive price cuts by foreign chemical fibre producers --
some selling at less than their production cost -- spurred China's
imports to 1.81 million tons last year, equivalent to 39.1 percent
of the country's total output.
</P>
<P>
China's chemical fibre producers, burdened by pressure from
both the sluggish domestic market and overseas dumping, witnessed
a sharp profit decline and increasing stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
The 118 large and medium-sized chemical fibre companies on
average had stocks of around 135 percent compared with output at
the end of June this year, according to the association.
</P>
<P>
But the key way for the chemical industry to come out of its
difficulties centres on its own adjustment and restructuring,
said Xu.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sector needs to lose no time in upgrading
technologies and equipment and developing new products. He also
urged producers to pay closer attention to applying to patent
their products, rather than simply focusing on production.

<HEADLINE> China Develops New Cancer Diagnostic Method </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese tumor expert Li
Weilian, of the Second Central Hospital of Tianjin, has developed
a new method of diagnosing cancer by observing a patient's tongue,
a method favored in traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Li found over years of practice that cancer patients' tongues
have similar phenomena that change as the disease progresses and
vary with different types of cancers.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Chinese medicine doctors believe that the tongue
shows symptoms of the body on its texture, fuzziness, and its
bottom that can reflect the state of a patient and the development
of the illness.
</P>
<P>
Li studied 209 cancer cases over the past five years that led
him to the relation between cancers and the tongue.
</P>
<P>
These indices may help increase accuracy in cancer
diagnoses. Effectiveness of mammary cancer treatments has risen
from about 40 percent to more than 70 percent and the method has
recently got approval from a team of medical analysts.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Net International Reserves Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net international
reserves have declined by 66.5 million U.S. dollars, the Jakarta
Post Monday quoted the central bank weekly report as saying.
</P>
<P>
In its latest weekly report, the central bank said net
international reserves declined from 14.104 billion dollars on
September 23 to 14.038 billion dollars on September 30.
</P>
<P>
The decline was mainly due to interest payment on government
foreign debt and selling of some U.S. dollars for the rupiah to
sterilize liquidity in the wake of greater government spending.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Army Downsizes for Peace, Efficiency (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) has begun a new move to cut a further half-million
personnel from its ranks over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
China's armed forces reduced their size by one million during
the 1980s. The reduction plan for the second time will be finished
at 2000. By then, China will have reduced the size of its armed
forces by a total of seven million in half a century of its
existence.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that when the current reduction move is
completed, the PLA's personnel, including non-military personnel,
will total 2.5 million, 0.21 percent of the country's
population. In comparison, the United States' army makes up 0.87
percent of its national population, and Russia's, 1.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
An official with the PLA Academy of Military Science says that
China's decision of disarmament has been made "unilaterally,
without any prerequisite or relevance to any other country".
</P>
<P>
Wang Huiqing, a doctor of military science, describes the
disarmament move as "a manifestation and enrichment of China's
outstanding traditional military thinking, which is characterized
by the pursuit of peace."
</P>
<P>
In the last disarmament move, the boundaries of the 11 regional
military commands were redrawn to just seven larger
commands. Infantry forces were reorganized into group armies,
which incorporated most of the previously independent armored
troops, artillery and engineer corps; and new electronic
countermeasure corps and camouflaged units were added to the army
formation.

<TEXT>
<P>
China's military spending has also been kept at a minimum for
self-defense and demobilized personnel have made outstanding
contributions to the country's social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's defense budget between 1979 and
1996 was reduced from 5.6 percent to the gross domestic product to
1.04 percent. The 1996 defense budget of 70.227 billion yuan (8.4
billion U.S. dollars) amounted to just one thirtieth of that of
the United States' and one ninth of Russia's.
</P>
<P>
The fact scuppers rumors that "China is working for arms
expansion" and that "China constitutes a threat", said Hu
Guangzheng, an associate professor of the PLA Academy of Military
Science.
</P>
<P>
"China has determined the size of its army according to defense
needs -- The PLA has always been a defensive army," he added.
</P>
<P>
Professor Qian Haihao of the academy said that while the size
of the army is reduced, high technology will be applied more
extensively so that the army will become more combat effective,
which is the trend of contemporary army construction.
</P>
<P>
The latest disarmament move will further improve the quality of
the Chinese army and shift the focus of army construction from
being labor intensive to being technology intensive.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has made great efforts to resettle
demobilized personnel, for the government officials consider that
the quality of what is done for the demobilized is a guarantee for
the success of the disarmament program.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that this year about 50,000 demobilized officers
are to be settled, while over the years an aggregate total of 3.1
million demobilized officers have been assisted by the government
with their re-entry into civilian life.
</P>
<P>
Demobilized personnel have been transferred to the fields of
land reclamation, railway construction, forestry, industry,
commerce and judicial departments. Records from the PLA General
Political Department show that 600,000 of the 3.1 million
demobilized officers have become highly-competent employees in
their civilian work units.

<HEADLINE> ``Chifeng Important for Study of Chinese Culture'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 5 (Xinhua) -- China's leading archaeologist
has called on specialists nationwide to pay more attention to the
area north of the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
"The ancient culture near Chifeng City and the cultures of the
Yellow River and the Yangtze River jointly gave birth to ancient
Chinese civilization," said Zhang Bozhao, curator of Beijing's Palace
Museum.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that the area near Chifeng, where farming and
nomadic cultures overlapped in ancient times, had a unique culture
as important as those in other places before the Xia Dynasty
(c.21st-c.16th century B.C.). And the culture there might
have spread to Siberia and Xinjiang, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Most historians have always believed that the central part of
China was the only birthplace of the Chinese people and culture.
</P>
<P>
Leading domestic and overseas historians and archaeologists
recently convened in Chifeng to discuss the ancient local culture.
</P>
<P>
They visited the Xiajiadian ruins, the ruins of post-Hongshan
Culture, the Jingong Palace ruins of the Liao Dynasty (907-1125)
and other cultural remains in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
and Liaoning Province.

<HEADLINE> China Goes Crazy for Electrical Appliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Each year, about 7 million
Chinese get married, and most of them set about furnishing their
new rooms or flats with the essential electricals of life. At the
same time, 80 percent of existing families are just about ready to
replace this applicance or that which may have been bought in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by year 2000, 3 million color TVs, 2.5 million
refrigerators and 3 million washing machines nationwide are
expected to be consigned to second-hand dealers and replaced by
new ones.
</P>
<P>
Liu Fuzhong, secretary-general of China Association of
Electrical Appliances, said that China now has 2,500 electrical
appliance manufacturers, churning out 120 different products.
</P>
<P>
"Production is on a huge scale," said Liu. China is now the
world's largest producer of color televisions, refrigerators,
washing machines, electric irons, fans and rice cookers. It also
produces about 20 percent of the world's air conditioners,
refrigerators and washing machines.
</P>
<P>
Chinese products are available in 173 countries and regions,
particularly the United States, Japan, Germany, France, UK and
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
High production strength has caused a fiercely-contested price
war to break out among producers. Compared with 1994 prices,
refrigerators, washing machines and air conditioners are half
their costs. Prices of color TVs and micro-wave ovens are down by
35 and 50 percent. VCDs in particular- production only began in
1995 - have witnessed a 16-fold sales increase as prices have
fallen by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Price cutting, however, does not imply a market depression,
but a strategy of pursuing low-margin high-sales operations," said
Liu.
</P>
<P>
Rural China also promises to be a new market horizon. The
market is currently stagnated by low incomes of rural residents --
earning of China's 900 million rural people are 12 years behind
the level of urban folk. Right now, most rural residents have
little more than a small TV or radio. But things will certainly
change.
</P>
<P>
"As the rural economy develops, farmers in poorer provinces
will get richer while the more-remote villages will be linked to
grid supplies. Furnishing houses to levels of comfort and
convenience we expect these people will involve the sale
of some 168 million color TVs, 180 million refrigerators and 170
million washing machines," predicted Liu. These figures correspond
to 10, 14 and 16 years of national annual production at the
current level.
</P>
<P>
To tap this vast market of the near future, sector specialists
say that small, inefficient producers will be eliminated by fierce
price warring which will leave large, efficient operations in
control. These will advertise widely and accept low profit margins
on high turnovers. Their R&AMP;D departments will continue to develop
high-tech products with performance and quality to match foreign
manufacturers. And in that way the lion's share of the domestic
market looks set to stay with home producers.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges Transparency in U.S., European Banking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai economic and financial
experts have called for transparency in U.S. and European banking
and hedge fund operations in the wake of newly exposed weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
"Transparency must be applied to U.S. banks and hedge funds as
well," Ekamol Kiriwat, former deputy governor of the Bank of
Thailand, said in remarks published Monday.
</P>
<P>
Since the financial crisis broke out in Thailand last year and
then spread to neighboring countries, Western policymakers have
laid blame on the lack of transparency in the Asian banking
system. Thailand and other Asian countries have been forced to
reform their financial sectors by imposing transparency rules.
</P>
<P>
But investors now are suspicious of hidden negative information
held by banks and hedge funds in Western countries, Ekamol was
quoted by the Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
After Alan Greenspan, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve,
organized a bailout of Long-Term Capital Management LP (LTCM),
attempting to avert damage to the U.S. economy, investors
suspected that there were other troubled hedge funds and their
collapse would spark a chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
The LTCM debacle had added momentum to the theory that hedge
funds are potential trouble. There is a call for transparency and
restriction of hedge funds, which play a significant role in
capital movement, especially in the short term.
</P>
<P>
Teerana Bhongmakapat, economics professor at Chulalongkorn
University in Thailand, said the LTCM bailout organized by
Greenspan demonstrated that the United States had recognized the
weakness in the U.S. financial system.
</P>
<P>
The hedge funds now pose a potential risk to the U.S. economy.
So far there is little information about their financial status
and how much they have borrowed, Teerana said.
</P>
<P>
Ekamol, however, added that this is a wrong time to apportion
blame. He said that as world financial leaders were meeting in
Washington, he hoped the G-7 and developing countries would make
joint efforts to solve the calamity.
</P>
<P>
Ekamol and Teerana shared the view that a world recession has
already begun and that world leaders must act to prevent the world
economy from plunging into a deeper recession.

<HEADLINE> Rental Cars Gain Popularity in Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Xie Weimin, a resident of
Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, rented a car
for 800 yuan (97 U.S. dollars) over the National Day holiday
period to take his family to nearby Ningbo holidays.
</P>
<P>
Xie said the rental car provided the family a convenient means
of travelling to destination they desired.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of licensed Chinese drivers in urban areas are
renting motor vehicles for sightseeing or visits to relatives and
friends.
</P>
<P>
Car rentals have boomed in many part of China in recent years since
many licensed drivers do not as yet own vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A dozen-odd car rental agencies have opened in Hangzhou, with
more than 80 percent of their fleets under rental contracts on any
given day. Agencies are, in fact, unable to meet demand on
holidays, according to an official with the Zhejiang Provincial
Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
Industry observers attribute the popularity of car rentals to
the constantly rising living standards of Chinese citizens and the
nation's improved transportation system.
</P>
<P>
The manager of one Hangzhou car rental agency said that his
agency's 40 vehicles were booked two weeks prior to National
Day. He noted that most vehicles were used for trips to nearby
scenic sites such as Ningbo, Shaoxing and Qiandaohu Lake.

<HEADLINE> Fujian-Taiwan Trade Developing Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Trade between east China's Fujian
and Taiwan provinces continued to develop in the first eight
months of this year, despite the influence of the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
A provincial government official said that during the
January-August period, the value of total imports and exports
between Fujian and Taiwan was 1.66 billion U.S. dollars, up 5.9
percent over the same 1997 period, and accounting for 12.7 percent
of the mainland's total trade volume with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
During this period, overseas-funded enterprises in Fujian had
1.36 billion U.S. dollars of trade volume with Taiwan, up 6.1
percent and accounting for 82 percent of the province's total
trade volume with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The processing industry, the major component of Fujian's trade
with Taiwan, generated 1.16 billion U.S. dollars in the first
eight months to August, up nearly five percent over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Fujian also optimized its trade structure with Taiwan, with
exports of primary products reduced, and those of manufactured
products increased.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that exports of primary products during the
January-August period generated 50 million U.S. dollars, down 20
percent, and those of manufactured products, 180 million
U.S. dollars, up 20 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Fujian-Taiwan trade volume has grown at an average
annual rate of 6.2 percent, and total trade volume has increased
from 2.02 billion U.S. dollars in 1993 to 2.57 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Stresses Ethnic Minority Group Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region has been successful in developing education in
its ethnic minority areas.
</P>
<P>
Part of this successes is due to the construction of nearly
5,000 schools buildings at a cost of more than 257 million yuan
(30 million U.S. dollars) over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is a region inhabited by some 40 different ethnic
minority groups living mainly in the northwestern, southwestern
and southeastern parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
At present, all the region's ethnic minority villages have
primary schools and teaching stations available, even in remote
areas, and most of the towns where ethnic minority people live
have junior middle schools.
</P>
<P>
There are now 164 students in the ethnic minority primary
schools and 63 in the middle schools.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1980, the region has allocated more than 4 million
yuan annually to support primary and middle schools in 24 counties
inhabited by ethnic minority people, and secondary school
education in some nine other prefectures.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the region has established 120 special courses for
ethnic-minority girls, which has been a difficult educational
problem in the region.
</P>
<P>
The region also introduced special teaching methods for Zhuang,
the largest ethnic group in the region with a population of 15.18
million. One of these methods is offering courses taught in the
Zhuang language.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Marcelo Rios overcame back
pain to beat American Andre Agassi over five sets to win the
Grand Slam Cup and prize money of 1.3 million U.S. dollars on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
American teenager Venus Williams snatched 800,000 dollars
after nipping Swiss Patty Schnyder in the women's final.
</P>
<P>
Rios, ranked third in the world, said he almost considered
quitting after being kept on court for just under three hours
before subduing Agassi 6-4, 2-6, 7-6, 5-7, 6-3 when the American
double-faulted on the Chilean's second match point.
</P>
<P>
"My back started hurting yesterday and I thought about not
playing," said the 22-year-old Rios.
</P>
<P>
Williams, 18, downed her 19-year-old rival 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted this title," said Williams. "I played pretty
well in the first set, then she picked it up a bit in the second.
I guess I just played that much better."

</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:

possible.

</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard has achieved a historic election
victory for his agenda of further economic reform including a
goods and services tax, despite a massive swing of more than 5
percent to the Labor.

<HEADLINE> Hoddle: Stop Trying to Assassinate Me </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- England manager Glenn Hoddle has
defended his decision to allow his players to use energy-boosting
injections in the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
And he urged the press to stop writing "rubbish" about him
being a "wacko" and let him get on with the task of leading the
national side.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of baggage that comes with this job and
they're trying to assassinate me in many ways," he told BBC Radio
5 Live on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle was criticized last week by Manchester United boss Alex
Ferguson for allowing a French doctor to give the injections to
members of his squad during the World Cup in France this summer.
</P>
<P>
But the England boss rejected Ferguson's claims and said he
had written to all the clubs before France 98:
</P>
<P>
"The Manchester United doctor spoke to the doctor we used for
the World Cup two to three weeks ago, found out exactly what was
used and there was no problem whatsoever," Hoddle said.
</P>
<P>
"Ironically the two players Alex Ferguson was talking about,
Paul Scholes and Teddy Sheringham, didn't have any injections so
I don't really know where last week's story came from."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle is becoming increasingly frustrated with his profile in
the popular press and has hit back at those who question his use
of faith healers and vitamin injections.
</P>
<P>
"Why is it wacko when the Brazil, Italian and German teams
have been doing that for 20 years?" Hoddle asked.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Held 0-0 By Burkina Faso at CAN Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria was held a goalless draw
by host Burkina Faso Sunday in Ouagadougou in a Group five
opening match of the 22nd African Nations Cup (CAN) slated for
Year 2000 in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The match in the Burkinabe capital is Nigeria's first
appearance at the continental event after being banned for two
and half years by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) for
withdrawing on the eve of the 20th CAN finals hosted by South
Africa in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The goalless draw is certainly a disappointment to the
Stallions of Burkina Faso who have been preparing hard for the
encounter, including an intensive training in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The Super Eagles of Nigeria, however, should be content with
the result, as the African football power is still recovering
from its disgraceful exit from the France 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Nigerian football observers said that Nigeria
would qualify for the finals after all, as none of the teams in
Group five, Burkina Faso, Senegal or Brundi would be strong eno
ugh to challenge the Super Eagles' dominance.
</P>
<P>
Super Eagles's chief-coach-to-be, Dutchman Thijs Libregts
flied to Ouagadougou with his team, but he had made it clear that
he would interfere with coach Shuaibu Amodu.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria won the CAN twice in 1980 and 1994, while Burkina
Faso's best result was the fourth place in January 1998, when it
hosted the 21st CAN finals.

MEXICO CITY, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States was drawn
Sunday in the same group with World Cup champion Brazil, World
Cup runner-up France and Oceania champion New Zealand in January
at Guadelajara, Mexico, in the FIFA Confederations Cup.
</P>
<P>
The other first-round group, which will play in Mexico City,
has Bolivia, Egypt, Mexico and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The tournament originally invited only the champions of FIFA's
continental confederations, but since European champion Germany
decided to pull out, the United States got the chance to fill the
spot.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which lost to Mexico in the North and
Central American and Caribbean championship final, was the second
finisher in the continent.
</P>
<P>
After winding up last in the 32 nations at the World Cup last
summer, the U.S. national team will be formed in this month, with
D.C. United coach Bruce Arena expected to take the head coach
position. He is the only American among the four candidates for
the post.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team will play New Zealand on January 10, take on
Brazil on January 13 and close the first round against France on
January 15.

<HEADLINE> Milutinovic Sees His Team Beaten in U.S. Soccer Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Bora Milutinovic, perhaps
soccer's most famous and successful coach for hire, has led the
national teams of Mexico, Costa Rica, the United States and
Nigeria to the World Cup's second round.
</P>
<P>
But apparently the MetroStars were too much of a challenge.
Milutinovic, who two weeks ago became New York/New Jersey's fifth
head coach in three years, watched his team get eliminated from
the playoffs last night in the U.S. Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
The Columbus Crew won 2-1 in a shootout for a two-game sweep
of the best-of-three, first-round playoff series.
</P>
<P>
"Our guys made a big effort but we didn't score," said
Milutinovic. "This was the difference in the game."
</P>
<P>
Columbus, which won the opener 5-3, will play either D.C. Unit
ed or the Miami Fusion in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic was fired by Nigeria after the African team failed
to enter the top 16 in the World Cup. He is one of the four
candidates for the vacant U.S. national team's head coach.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Blank Newcastle, Chelsea Hold Liverpool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Dutchman Dennis Bergkamp ended
his scoring drought of the season with two goals which helped
defending champions Arsenal blank Newcastle United 3-0 at home in
the English Premier League match on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The win moved Arsenal up to the third in the team standings at
13 points, one point behind Manchester United who have a game in
hand and beat bottom side Southampton 3-0 on Saturday, and seven
adrift of leaders Aston Villa, 2-1 winners over Coventry City.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other game Chelsea's Italian striker Pierluigi
Casiraghi scored his first goal in English football but Jamie
Redknapp struck home a late free-kick to earn Liverpool a 1-1
draw at Anfield.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea and Liverpool both have 12 points.
</P>
<P>
At Highbury Bergkamp could have had a hat-trick but saw his
second penalty of the match spectacularly saved by Newcastle
goalkeeper Shay Given three minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
The Dutchman ended his 10-game drought in front of goal after
21 minutes. French strike partner Nicolas Anelka split the
Newcastle defense with a pass and Bergkamp fired low past Given.
</P>
<P>
Bergkamp returned the favor eight minutes later, breaking onto
Marc Overmars' hopeful hoof forward and squaring for Anelka to
sidefoot home with the Newcastle defense nowhere.
</P>
<P>
After 65 minutes Overmars earned a penalty after being brought
down by Newcastle's Greek defender Nikos Dabizas, who received a
second yellow card and was sent off. Bergkamp tucked away the
spotkick to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
With three minutes left Bergkamp was felled in the area by
Philippe Albert but his penalty kick was parried by Given, who
had made a string of fine saves to keep the score down.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle's defeat ended their run of three successive league
wins and completed a miserable week following their European Cup
Winners' Cup exit at Partizan Belgrade on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Van Gogh's Paintings on Show in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of
American art lovers will have a chance to view the brilliant color
paintings of Dutch Vincent Van Gogh as 72 of his masterpieces are
on show in U.S. capital Washington.
</P>
<P>
The art exhibition, at the National Gallery of Art, started
Sunday and will run to January 3, 1999. It was the first largest
Van Gogh exhibit outside The Netherlands and in the United States
in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The paintings from 1882 to 1890 include some of Van Gogh's
best known works, such as the "Yellow House" where he lived in
the southern French town of Arles, "The Harvest" and "The
Bedroom."
</P>
<P>
The field of wheat, the potatos, the parks, the boat and the
pair of shoes, all the paintings feature the real life of the
artist in his time, showing his love of life.
</P>
<P>
Born on March 30, 1853, in Zundert, a village in the southern
province of North Brabart, the Netherlands, Van Gogh began to work
at the age of 16. He worked for a French art dealers company, took
a job as an assistant teacher in England and later became a
clergyman at home and in abroad. His hard life supported his
works.
</P>
<P>
On the first-day show, hundreds of art lovers waited outside
the gallery for hours to have a first look.
</P>
<P>
The paintings are on loan from the Van Gogh Museum in
Amsterdam. The exhibit will move to the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art on January 17 till April 4, 1999, before returning to the
Amsterdam museum.

<HEADLINE> Knowledge Growth May Widen Gap Between Rich and Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The global explosion of
knowledge now underway may create a widening gap between the rich
and poor countries, according to a report released Sunday by the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth in global knowledge may lift hundreds of
millions of the world's poor out of poverty, or throw them further
and further behind the wealthy ones, the report said.
</P>
<P>
New communications technology and plummeting computing costs
would enable the poor to tap into a rapidly expanding global store
of knowledge, which is crucial to improving their health and
living standards, but the rapid growth of knowledge would also
make it possible that the poor would fall behind more rapidly than
ever before, noted the report entitled "Knowledge for
Development."
</P>
<P>
Developing countries "need not reinvent the wheel, or the
computer or treatment for malaria. Rather than re-create existing
knowledge, poorer countries have the option of acquiring and
adapting knowledge already available in richer countries," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"In our enthusiasm for the Information Super Highway we must
not forget the villages and slums without telephones,electricity
or safe water, the primary schools without pencils, paper or
books," World Bank President James Wolfensohn writes in the
foreword to the report.
</P>
<P>
Low national incomes are not the only reason why poor countries
are less prosperous than richer ones, the report said. Many
developing countries lack the capability to acquire and adapt the
economic, technical, and social knowledge that has spurred many of
the world's development success stories.
</P>
<P>
The bank's chief economist, Joseph Stiglitz, said:"Knowledge
is one area where government policies can make a difference when
resources are scarce."
</P>
<P>
Many of the estimated 2 million children around the world who
die from diarrhea could be saved if their parents knew how to
prepare a simple solution of water, sugar and salt, Stiglitz
noted.
</P>
<P>
Carl Dahlman, main author of the report, believes that
governments that adopt policies to make the most of knowledge will
have major advantage in improving the lives of their citizens.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, developing countries are badly in need
of how-to knowledge such as nutrition, birth control, engineering
and accounting, and knowledge about attributes or characteristics
such as product standards, accounting systems or creditworthiness
of a firm.
</P>
<P>
The report argues that lacking knowledge is "information
problems" which in turn could lead to market failures such as
lenders' refusal to offer loans to poor people, because of the
difficulty in assessing their ability to repay.
</P>
<P>
It believes that knowledge gaps could be narrowed through
education, better phone systems and openness to exchanges with
foreign countries, including trade.
</P>
<P>
Founded 54 years ago, the World Bank is striving to become a
clearing house for all the development knowledge. It expects to
have its knowledge management system online by 2000 so that
clients, partners and member governments around the world can
benefit from it.

<HEADLINE> Iran Ready to Mediate Between Turkey, Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Sunday announced Tehran's readiness to mediate
between Turkey and Syria to solve their disputes.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the announcement in a telephone conversation with
his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Sharaa, the official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel's conspiracy is the main target behind recent tension
between Turkey and Syria, Kharrazi told Sharaa. Tel Aviv is trying
to seize an opportunity in order to make the region insecure, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the recent developments between Turkey
and Syria, he underlined that Ankara needs to further preserve
self-restraint because military threats will not solve anything.
</P>
<P>
If there are any problems between the regional countries, it
should be resolved through negotiations and through the mediation
of other regional nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa appreciated the Iranian initiative aimed at eliminating
tensions between Damascus and Ankara, saying that his country
welcomes any endeavors by Iran in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Syria is not for any military conflict with Turkey, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Syria and Turkey were deteriorated in recent
weeks after Ankara reportedly massed up troops along its borders
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Turkey have been at loggerheads over issues of
separatist Kurds, water-sharing and the Turkish-Israeli
military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of backing the Turkish Kurdish
rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy of the
Kurds in southeastern Turkey and often launched across-border
attacks from their bases in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
And Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliance with
Israel, saying that it threatens Arab security and undermines
Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.

Turkey and Syria, saying Israel will "take steps" to reassure
Damascus about it, Israel Radio reported.

CAIRO -- Egypt, along with Israel with which it signed a peace
deal in 1979, will get less U.S. aid for the first time in almost
two decades, U.S. ambassador to Egypt Daniel Kurtzer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference Sunday with Zafer el Beshri,
Egypt's minister of state for planning and international
cooperation, Kurtzer said U.S. assistance to Egypt and Israel will
be "reduced by five percent since 1999."
</P>
<P>
However he denied that his country was planning a zero aid to
Egypt, the first Arab country to achieve peace with the Jewish
state under U.S. brokerage. The two have been awarded U.S.
economic and military aid as "peace dividends."
</P>
<P>
According to Kurtzer, the drop in the annual aid to Egypt from
815 million dollars to 775 million is a move the U.S. Congress is
undertaking in view of skinny U.S. budget resources.
</P>
<P>
The Congress has, however, approved to keep military aid to
Egypt intact. (Egypt-US-Aid Cut)

unacceptable and that the Arab stance was in support of Syria,

<HEADLINE> Latvians Vote for Easier Citizenship for Ethnic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Latvians have voted for easier
citizenship for ethnic Russians, preliminary reports from the
Baltic country's Saturday referendum show.
</P>
<P>
In a national referendum held in conjunction with the
parliamentary elections, 53 percent voted for the citizenship
amendments approved by the parliament, the Saeima, on June 22, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The June amendments nullified the existing provisions on "the
naturalization of aliens", and gave citizenship to children born
after the country's 1991 independences.
</P>
<P>
Latvian language proficiency tests would also be simplified for
applicants of non-Latvian ethnics older than 65.
</P>
<P>
The original citizenship law has been strongly objected by
ethnic Russians, which account for one third of the Latvian
population, and criticized by Russia, the United States and the
European countries.
