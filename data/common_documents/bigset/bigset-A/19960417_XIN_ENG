<HEADLINE> Khamenei Lashes US for Supporting Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today lashed out at the U.S. administration for
supporting Israel, terming the attacks on Lebanon as a "great
human tragedy."
</P>
<P>
Addressing ranking commanders of the armed forces on the eve of
the army day, Khamenei said that the U.S. president and
administration support the "wicked and criminal Zionist" in the
face of such a great and blatant tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader expressed regret over the silence of
certain Arab and Islamic states and other countries towards the
attacks by Israel.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Hezbollah and the Lebanese people are in a
defensive position, noting that Hezbollah is struggling to defend
Lebanon's independence and liberate it from Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Struggle for independence and against occupation is a praise
worthy matter in the cultures of all nations of the world, but the
global arrogance led by the U.S. castigate such a liberation
movement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in his speech, Khamenei pointed to the role of the
Islamic revolution on freeing Iran and the Iranian nation from
dependence on other countries, saying that independence has
various stages the first of which is political independence.
</P>
<P>
He said "today the Islamic Republic of Iran is an independent
state whose government, president and members of Parliament fear
no power and whose president takes such positions towards
Palestine and Bosnia that arouse the anger of the enemies of
Islam."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian armed forces should be an army that very well
suits the independence and the human goals pursued by the Moslem
people of Iran, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that economic independence precedes political
independence.
</P>
<P>
He called on officials, members of parliaments and other
agencies in charge of financial affairs to totally cut off the
country's dependence in monetary and economic fields.

KIEV, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
made it clear today that his country was keen to develop a good
relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
but was still not ready to join it.
</P>
<P>
He told NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, who was here on a
two-day official visit, that Ukraine planned to expand its
cooperation with NATO in all non-military fields such as politics,
science and technology and information exchanging.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and NATO signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation
last month.
</P>
<P>
When talking about NATO's planned eastward enlargement, the
president said it should be a step-by-step and transparent
process. He added that it was important for NATO to exchange views
with both Kiev and Moscow on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Solana also agreed that NATO should act with caution.
</P>
<P>
He then said Ukraine is one of the few countries which has
contributed peace-keeping forces in the conflicting Bosnian and
Istocna Slavonija areas.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Ukraine abandon its non-aligned status to
promote the creation of an all-European security system.

quarter of 1995 to 16.3 percent in the first quarter of 1996,"
Eaton said.
</P>

JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Foreign
Minister Herve de Charette said here Monday night that the
solution to the current Lebanese Crisis can only be diplomatic,
not military.
</P>
<P>
Charette, who made the remarks following his meeting with Prime
 Minister Shimon Peres, arrived in Israel Monday afternoon on his
trouble-shooting mission in the Middle East. He is expected to
leave here for consultations with Lebanese and Syrian leaders
later today.
</P>
<P>
France and the EU have spoken out in favor of maintaining
normal ties with Iran against U.S. and Israeli wishes so as to
persuade the Iranian authorities to rein in Hezbollah who
receives substantial support from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his country will coordinate its steps with
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that "it is too early to imagine what can be
possible to bring the crisis to an end." However, he said he
would like to "emphasize urgency to find a rapid solution."
</P>
<P>
France maintain special relations with Lebanon due to historic
background. Earlier this month President Jacques Chirac visited
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After Israel launched Operation Grapes of Wrath on April 11,
Chirac complained to Peres that Israel's response had been out of
proportion to the Hezbollah attacks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Slips in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. industrial production
fell 0.5 percent in March, the second decline in the past three
year, U.S Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said the decline in output at the nation's factories,
mines and utilities was mainly due to the impact of an 18-day
strike that brought output at General Motors to a near standstill.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production declined 0.4 percent in January and
it bounced back with a revised 1.3 percent in February, up from
the 1.2 percent increase announced earlier. The gain in February
was the biggest advance since an identical increase in October
1987.
</P>
<P>
The Fed also said the nation's industries were operating at
82.5 percent of capacity in March, down from 83.2 percent a month
earlier and 84.6 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Other factors also contributed to the decline of the industrial
production in March. For instance, U.S. purchasing executives
found manufacturing weakened in March for the eighth straight
month, although the rate of decline slowed.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production grew at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in
the first quarter, compared to an anemic 0.6 percent in the final
three months of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said factory output fell 0.8 percent in March after
rising 1.5 percent a month earlier
</P>
<P>
Production of durable goods plunged 1.4 percent, nearly wiping
out a 2 percent gain in the previous month. Production of nondurable
goods such as clothing and chemicals edged up 0.1 percent after
climbing 0.9 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Mining production shot up 2 percent on top of a 1.6 percent
advance a month earlier. Output by the nation's utilities grew 0.7
percent after falling 1.1 percent in February.

on Tuesday condemned Israeli bombardments on Lebanese civilian
area, saying that Israel's attack is "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Assembly on the sixth day of Israel's
Operation Grapes of Wrath, Juppe said France was "concerned by the
dramatic consequences of the Israeli bombardments on the Lebanese
civilian population, which has been thrown on to the roads of a
massive exodus."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the targets of the bombardments were
civilians who had been "taken hostage, notably by the destruction
of two power stations in Beirut. These are unacceptable acts."
</P>
<P>
The crisis needed "a political, not a military
solution ... through arrangements permitting a durable calm in the
region," Juppe said in answer to a deputy's question.
</P>
<P>
He added that France understood and shared Israel's concern
for its security, saying "the concern of the Israeli government to
protect its people is legitimate."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated French support for the non-binding U.N. Security
Council Resolution 425 which calls for withdrawal of Israeli
troops from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Juppe reiterated the French concern that escalating violence in
the area was threatening the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette is on a
diplomatic mission to the Middle East intended to end the
hostilities in the region.

<HEADLINE> FAO Predicts 5 Percent Increase in Grain Output in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) predicted here today that global
grain production will probably increase by 5 percent in 1996 to
reach 1.99 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
However, the FAO said in a report that the price will still
rise due to soaring demands for grain around the world.
</P>
<P>
The output of coarse food grain is expected to hit 860 million
tons with a remarkable increase of 9 percent, while wheat output
will grow by 5 percent to hit 570 million tons and rice output by
1 percent to reach 560 million tons, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The FAO report in the meantime foresaw a reduction in the
output of oil-bearing crops in 1996 and a higher price for edible
oil.

<HEADLINE> EC Calls for Dropping Curbs on Scrap Metal Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today urged Romania, Bulgaria and Poland to phase out their export
restrictions on ferrous scrap, a vital raw material for steel
production.
</P>
<P>
An EC spokesman said the EC has also persuaded Russia to reduce
its export tax on scrap during negotiations on scrap trade.
</P>
<P>
He said the EC's negotiations with those Eastern European
states aimed to get more supply of ferrous scrap and set an agreed
date for full liberalization of the scrap trade.
</P>
<P>
Export bans or restrictions on scrap, the spokesman said, have
"artificially" lowered domestic scrap prices in Central and
Eastern Europe to as cheap as 40-50 ECUs per ton, compared with
the average price of 90-110 ECUs per ton for the EU states.
</P>
<P>
The EC has been working to have scrap restrictions removed by
non-EU member countries since 1994.
</P>
<P>
EC statistics showed that its scrap import from Central and
Eastern Countries (CEECs) in 1994 fell by 18.4 percent to 1.64
million tons and that the CEECs' share in the total EU imports of
ferrous scrap dropped 40 percent in 1994 from 55 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
An extra 375,000 tons of scrap, worth some 25-35 million ECUs
(one ECU equals 1.3 U.S. dollars) will be sold to EC member states
in 1996 by Romania, Bulgaria, Poland and the Slovak Republic,
according to the EC.

<HEADLINE> Surveys Boost Hopes of Feel-Good Factor Revival in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Hopes of a "feel-good factor"
revival have been boosted by two new surveys showing a sharp jump
in high street spending and a stronger housing market, according
to a BBC TV report today.
</P>
<P>
One survey, by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), shows that
the value of retail sales in March was 7.5 percent higher than in
the same month a year earlier, against a year-on-year rise of 3.6
percent in February.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest annual rise since the BRC began producing
sales data in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The figures provided strong support for the view put forward by
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that rapid consumer spending
growth would be the key to wider economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Figures were affected by the fact that Easter came earlier this
year than last.
</P>
<P>
But the consortium said that the figures still pointed to a
strong underlying annual growth rate of between 4.5 percent and 5
percent, a sharp rise from average monthly sales growth of 4
percent over the previous three months.
</P>
<P>
The other survey by the Royal Institution of Chattered
Surveyors found that March was the best month for the housing
market for two years, with more than two-thirds of its members
reporting an increase in activity.
</P>
<P>
The institution reported greater interest from house-hunters
during 1996 than for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Institution spokesman Tony Joyce said: "There is now almost
complete unanimity among chartered surveyor estate agents that
confidence is returning to the market. There are more registered
applicants and serious purchasers."

<HEADLINE> Britain to Take Legal Action Against EU Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
said today Britain would take legal action over the European
Union's (EU) world-wide ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the question time in Parliament this afternoon,
Major said, "the export ban on British beef imposed by the
European Community is more motivated by the interests of other
countries beef market than it is about public health."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British National Farmers' Union (NFU) has also
threatened to launch a legal challenge against the EU if it failed
to lift the British beef ban.
</P>
<P>
An NFU spokesman is quoted by the BBC television as saying,"we
had been maneuvering for a couple weeks on whether to launch a
legal challenge" and took the case to the European Court.
</P>
<P>
The legal challenge statements follow remarks by EU Agriculture
Commissioner Franz Fischler that the ban had not been brought in
on health grounds and he thought British beef was safe to eat.
</P>
<P>
Senior government minister earlier indicated that what the
Commissioner said could open the way to a legal challenge by the
British government in the European Court.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the overall ban on British beef products exports
after British ministers last month disclosed that people might be
able to develop the fatal brain disease, CJD, if eating meat from
animals infected with BSE or mad cow disease.

fifth air raid of its kind at the mainly Shiite Moslem populated
area in six successive days.
</P>

Security sources reported that the most notable air raid
Israeli warplanes carried out today was that one targeting the
residence of Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri at Monsailih
around 3:30 pm (12:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Berri is the Secretary General of the pro-Syrian "Amal"
movement, a Mainly Shiite Moslem group which plays a role in
Lebanon's resistance against the Israeli occupation.

The Israeli warplanes fired four air-to-surface missiles at
the building and destroyed it, the security sources said. Berri

<HEADLINE> French National Orchestra Makes Beijing Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese music lovers were treated
to a first-class concert tonight when the French National
Orchestra, under the baton of Charles Dutoit, made its Beijing
debut.
</P>
<P>
"I always have a feeling of admiration for Chinese
culture. It's my very very pleasure to be here for the first time
as a musician, not as a tourist, and I'm looking forward to
meeting the Chinese public," Dutoit said before the premiere.
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour concert, Dutoit and the orchestra presented
a capacity audience of 1,600 Debussy's "The Sea", Liszt's
Overtune de Benvenuto Cellini accompanied by pianist Martha
Argerich, and Stravinski's "The Rite of Spring", winning hearty
applause from listeners.
</P>
<P>
Dutoit won the first prize in a conductor contest in Geneva in
1958, and is labeled as the best interpreter of the popular master
piece "The Rite of Spring".
</P>
<P>
The French National Orchestra, founded in 1934, enjoys a
world-wide reputation for its interpretation of pieces by French
composers as well as its unique performing style.
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm of the Chinese audience left a deep impression
on the two music masters. Argerich described the audience as
"extremely responsive", while Dutoit said:" I didn't know how the
public would react, and I didn't expect that they would be so
enthusiastic."
</P>
<P>
This evening's concert unveiled the long-expected '96 China
International Symphony Music Year organized by the Chinese
Ministry of Culture.
</P>
<P>
To follow are the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Royal
Concertgebouw Orchestra and the Wiener Philharmoniker, under
separate batons of Wolfgang Sawallosch, Riccardo Chailly and Zubin
Mehta.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Chinese music circles said that tours by the
world's four top symphony orchestras are expected to stir up a
craze for symphony music among Chinese people.

LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Schools across Britain is facing
teacher shortage as the number of applicants is falling
dramatically, according to a report in the Independent newspaper
today.
</P>
<P>
The number applying to become secondary teachers has dropped by
12 percent since last April.
</P>

At the beginning of this month, just 15,000 people had applied
for posts on post-graduate course for secondary school teachers,
as compared to 17,000 at the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
Poor wages and low morale which have dogged the profession for
years are now being compounded by a spate of redundancies and
early retirements

<HEADLINE> Nigeria May Quit ECOMOG, Forign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian official said here
yesterday the country was considering the withdrawal of its
peacekeepers from war-torn Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The federal gevernment, reeling under the financial burdern of
maintaining its 8,500 strong contingent in the West African
peacekeeping force ECOMOG in Liberia, may pull out except there
is a helping hand from the international community, Nigerian
Foreign Minister Chief Tom Ikimi said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has committed more than four billion US Dollars into
the ECOMOG operations since hostilities broke out in Liberia in
early 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to Ikimi, Nigeria is only interested in finding
peace for Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The twist in policy towards the ECOMOG peacekeeping force in
Liberia, he explained, was informed by the fact that ECOMOG has
not got the strength in terms of material and logistics to police
the entire territory of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Nigerian troops, there are 1,000 soldiers from
Ghana, 1,000 from Guinea and an insignificant number from the
Gambia and Sierra Leone for peacekeeping mission in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The warring factions, according to Ikimi, have men in arms in
the excess of 60,000 and there were guerillas who were in all
nooks and crannies of the country beyond the control of ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity heads of state summit, he
said, would come up in July but the crisis at hand would not wait
till then.
</P>
<P>
The committee of nine would meet in Accra, Ghana, on May 7 and
8 to discuss the Liberian crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Ikimi, it is important that heads of state
especially of the countries contributing troops to ECOMOG, meet
quickly to reassess the situation.
</P>
<P>
He criticised the American position in the crisis, adding that
the United States had the resources but failed to support ECOMOG
to contain the upsurge of the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was set up in 1990 by some West African countries at
the initiative of the Nigerian government to save that country
from self-destruction. The war is believed to have claimed
180,000 lives. enditem

<HEADLINE> Britain's Farmer Commits Suicide over Mad Cow Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A British farmer committed suicide
on Sunday because of financial ruin stemming from the mad cow
(BSE) crisis, reported the Guardian newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The farmer, John Capp in Beckingham, Lincolnshire, was found
dead from carbon monaxide. His friends said that the beef scare
had "tipped him over the edge" and that he had been unable to sell
any of his 200 cattle since the BSE scare started last March.
</P>
<P>
Auctioneer Paul Gentry, who sold cows for Capp at the cattle
market, said that Capp had hundreds of thousands of pounds tied up
in beef and financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Samaritans in Lincolnshire said that they
had been receiving calls from "very despairing men" who feared
that they would face ruin because of the beef scare.

<HEADLINE> Monrovia Suffers Endless Looting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Looters that have taken over the
streets in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, are showing no signs of
ending their operations even at the risk of being shot by the
armed government forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile there is no indication of an immediate stop of
fighting which started 11 days ago despite the ceasefire
agreement reached between warring factions last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Armed youths come in and shoot around a building but the
shooting is mainly to scare people off so the gunmen can loot," a
report reaching here today quoted one of the few foreign
residents who still remain in the city as saying.
</P>
<P>
Central Monrovia bears the scars of heavy fighting. Streets
are littered with bullet cartridges, burnd out cars and wreckage,
and looters and gunmen have reduced many buildings to shells, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Shops, offices, homes and UN and aid compounds have all been
cleared off, it added.
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted in Monrovia on April 6 after the coalition
goverment tried to arrest Roosevelt Johnson on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
Currently fighters loyal to Johnson, the ethnic Krahn militia
leader, around the barclay trainig center barracks are facing off
against supporters of Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromahwm.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have given orders to bring more fighters into
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Accordig to the media, Taylor says he will not negotiate
with Johnson, whom he accuses of holding hundreds of people
hostage.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Johnson said on Sunday he would agree to a
truce provided the militias withdrew from around the barracks,
African peacekeepers deployed throughout the city and mediators
re-examined agrrangements for the transitional government which
sacked him from the cabinet last month.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Say West Blackmails Serbs with Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bosnian Serb official
today blamed the international community for preventing the Serb
delegates from attending the Brussels conference on Bosnian
reconstruction and trying to blackmail the Serbs with aid.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Yugoslavia's Radio Obrenovac, the Serb
parliament speaker Momcilo Krajisnik said the Serb authority had
been allowed to attend the Brussels conference only on condition
that it joined the Bosnian delegation headed by the prime minister
of the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels donors conference, held on April 12-13, was
attended by more than 50 countries and nearly 30 international
organizations. The Serbs did not attend the meeting as it refused
to be part of the joint Bosnian delegation.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said the Serb officials had told the High
Representative of the international community Carl Bildt that the
Serb representatives would not go to Brussels as members of the
joint Bosnian delegation because there was no central government
in Bosnia until the general elections are held in September.
</P>
<P>
These reasonable remarks, he said, were rejected and the
Bosnian Serbs were later accused of boycotting the Brussels
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Serb leader said the insistence on economic reintegration
in Bosnia according to the Brussels model "is a violation of the
Dayton agreement and that economic aid also contains elements of
blackmail."
</P>
<P>
Through the economic aid, "the west wants to realize certain
political aims, primarily to force Serb President Radovan Karadzic
and Serb Army commander General Ratko Mladic out of the political
scene" in Bosnia, Krajisnik said.
</P>
<P>
The international community has said the economic aid would not
be granted to the Serbs unless the two above-mentioned Serb
leaders, who were charged with war crimes by the Hague-based
international war crimes tribunal, step down.

CAIRO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal al
Ganzouri met here today with Chinese State Councillor Chen Junsheng
and an accompanying delegation who are on a five-day visit to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chen said that China is giving much
attention to the development of cooperation between the two
countries as well as the bonds of traditional friendship between
the two peoples. He expressed his conviction that the exchange of
visits at top levels between China and Egypt would further promote
the existing relations of friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official also expressed his appreciation of Egypt's
growing role in international and African affairs and in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
On agricultural cooperation between the two countries, Chen
said, "There are similar conditions in the agricultural field
between China and Egypt, and we ought to learn from each other in
this field."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that wide scale cooperation and exchanges
between China and Egypt as well as mutual benefit from successful
experiences of either party would push forward agricultural
development in both countries.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Ganzouri said he was pleased with the developments
in China, emphasizing that China's achievements in economic
development were not only in the interest of China, but also in
the interest of other countries which were shifting to the market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri pointed out that there existed a strong foundation for
cooperation between Egypt and China, adding that cooperation
between the two countries would witness favorable development in
all fields in future.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri asked Chen to convey his invitation to Chinese Premier
Li Peng to visit Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Egyptian Deputy Premier and Minister of
Agriculture and Land Reclamation Youssef Wali also met with the
Chinese visitors, who arrived here Sunday.
</P>
<P>

cooperation between the two countries, particularly trading and

production of non-conventional fodder, technology of genetic
engineering and combat of desertation.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Not to Normalize Ties with Israel before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah has
said that Kuwait would not normalize its relations with Israel
before a solution of all Israeli-Arab disputes.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the London-based Al-Wasat weekly, Sheikh
Sabah said that the recent reception of Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres by Qatar and Oman is "a policy which concerns them
and is not related to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nor to
the security in the Gulf," Kuwait News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Israel resolves the problems with its Arab
neighboring countries, there will be nothing separating it from
us, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Peres visited Oman and Qatar early this month and met senior
officials of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah said his country's diplomatic relations with
Jordan will be restored soon, and denied the reports that there
are conditions from the two sides for normalization of the
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's relations with Jordan were not severed as "our
Embassy in Jordan is open," he said, asserting that Amman has
called on Iraq to implement the U.N. Security Council resolutions,
which is Kuwait's main condition to restore ties with those
countries which sided with Iraq during its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He denied the reports that 300,000 Palestinians will return to
Kuwait, recalling that "the Palestinians harmed the Kuwaitis too
much during the Iraqi occupation."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian, the Jordanian, the Egyptian or the Syrian
can not enter Kuwait unless he has a work contract or a visit
visa," he explained.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 honest Palestinians are still living in Kuwait,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait disbursed 25 million U.S. dollars to the Palestinians in
the self-rule areas the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under the
condition that the World Bank spends the sum on the building of
schools and hospitals, Sheikh Sabah said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's diplomatic relations with Yemen were not cut and the
Kuwaiti Embassy in Sanaa is open, he said, stressing, however, that
"things should not be speeded up" as for the normalization of
ties with Yemen.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM Visits Israel on Mediation Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres and visiting Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti
discussed here this afternoon the Israeli-Lebanese conflict amid
an intensive diplomatic drive to stop the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference, Peres said Israel does
want to bring an end to the violence. He said Israel had been
approached by the U.S. with an initiative, and it welcomes it.
</P>
<P>
"While Israel does not show impatience about it, we told the
prime minister very clearly that we are interested to bring an
end to the shooting, killing, bombing and suffering completely
and as soon as possible," he said. "Some ideas were raised on how
to do it in the best possible way."
</P>
<P>
Peres said that the American position on the conflict has very
much contributed to the possibility of conducting negotiations
now.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel has clearly-defined its targets: stopping
Katyusha attacks on Israeli civilians and also on Israeli
military forces in the so-called security zone from population
centers in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said that Jordanian leaders are especially concerned
about public support in their country for the peace treaty with
Israel in light of the Israeli operation in Lebanon. He added
that his conversation with Peres was sincere and frank.
</P>
<P>
He said that "he wants to convey the prime minister how public
opinion is feeling toward the recent event and I told him how
frustrated, how shocked and how angry the public opinion is
because this cycle of violence does not seem to be able to be
contained and stopped."
</P>
<P>
"Something has to be done and we hope we could work together
to stop it and go back to the peaceful track," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said he was heartened by what he called very positive
response from Israel to the diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti brought a letter from King Hussein to Peres
expressing Jordan's view of these events and discussing means of
putting an end to the state of tension.
</P>
<P>
The king issued a stern warning Monday to the ambassadors
of the five U.N. Security Council permanent members and the
"troika" of the European Union. "The escalation of violence in
Lebanon is threatening the peace process," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat to Maintain Coordination in Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat have agreed on maintaining
coordination between Egypt and Palestine in support of the peace
process in line with the pattern already agreed upon, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa disclosed here today.
</P>
<P>
The pattern covers Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian
territories in the West Bank and movement toward the initiation of
the final phase of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Following today's round of talks between Mubarak and Arafat,
Moussa said the two leaders have also dealt with several intricate
issues prevailing in the Palestinian arena as well as the
Palestinian track of peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Moussa further revealed that the greater part of the talks was
given to the present situation in Lebanon, in view of current
grave developments and the fact that all contacts so far had not
been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating Egypt's stance toward the situation in Lebanon, the
Egyptian foreign minister said, "We are calling for ceasefire, the
safeguarding of civilians, and the implementation of the July 1993
agreement with appropriate security guarantees, taking into
consideration that Israeli withdrawal from the Lebanese
territories in conformity with Security Council resolution 425
constitutes the best possible guarantee for the maintenance of
security in these areas as well as in Lebanon and Israel."
</P>
<P>
On an emergency session of the Arab League Council, due to
convene Wednesday, Moussa said the meeting would take place at the
request of Lebanon "and we expect the Lebanese government to
expound the situation and submit its demands."
</P>
<P>
"It is certain," he added, "that any aggression, disturbance or
obstruction of the peace process will undermine the atmosphere
which we are all trying to create in order that we may carry on
the peace process as agreed upon in the Madrid conference."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that "diplomatic efforts have not borne
fruits so far, and we are in contact with all parties -- the U.S.,
French and Arab parties" -- pointing out that American contacts
and mediation were under way with the Syrians, Lebanese and
Israelis for the resolution of the situation in Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China and Iraq signed here today
a memorandum which will provide Iraq with 500,000 U.S. dollars
worth of medicinal raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, which was signed by Chinese ambassador to Iraq
Sun Bigan and Iraqi Under Secretary of Industry and Minerals Abdu
al-Lakhman, aims to help the Iraqis who are under more than
five-year-old U.N. sanctions for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The medicinal raw materials will be shipped to Iraq and
received by Iraq's Samara General Industrial Company in mid-March
this year via the Jordanian port of Aqaba under the U.N. approval.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, the Chinese ambassador said that the
medicinal supplies to Iraq reflect the friendly feelings the
Chinese people cherished toward the Iraqi people. He expressed his
hope for continued growth of friendly relations between the two
countries, adding China will work hard in the world arena for an
early end to the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Abdu al-Lakhman appreciated the stance taken by the Chinese
government toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China also donated medicinal raw materials to Iraq,
valued at 360,000 dollars. The materials have been used for the
treatment of sick Iraqis.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A number of U.S. hospitals
have begun placing tiny security devices on newborns' ankles to
prevent infant snatching.
</P>
<P>
Houston's Memorial Hospital Southwest, where an infant was
abducted in October by a woman disguised as a health aide, this
week joins the list of hospitals using such devices, news reports
said.
</P>
<P>
An alarm will go off at the hospital if a baby comes within a
certain distance of stairs or an elevator, or if someone tries to
remove the band, officials said. A central monitoring system
alerts hospital staff of the baby's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
About 40 other hospitals in the country already use the baby
alarm bands.
</P>
<P>
From 1983 to 1995, 154 newborns have been reported abducted
from hospitals across the country, according to the National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Arlington, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of the kidnappings were from the mother's

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The first stage of the
presidential election campaign in Russia ended tonight, as the
term, envisaged by the law for submitting documents to the Central
Electoral Commission (CEC) for registration of candidates for the
presidency, expired.
</P>
<P>
A group of supporters of Vyacheslav Ushakov, president of the
Moscow Investment Fund, was the last to turn in 1.16 million
signatures to the CEC just before 18:00 Moscow time, when the CEC
shut its doors to presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian election law, it is necessary for any
initiative group to present at least one million signatures to
register is chosen person as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
By early March, the CEC had registered 88 initiative groups and
six electoral associations which nominated 78 candidates to the
post of the Russian President. However, some groups have dissolved
themselves while some candidates changed their minds and withdrew
from the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Only four candidates, vying for the presidency, have been
registered by now. The right to contest in the presidential
elections scheduled in June was given to Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov, President Boris Yeltsin, Liberal Democratic
Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky and former Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Member Countries Urged To Reduce Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The COMESA Secretary
General, Bingu wa Mutharika, today called on countries in the
region to reduce pre and post-harvest losses from pests and
diseases to increase food availability.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the Common Market For Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) made the call in Arusha, Northern Tanzania, when
addressing a three-day UNIDO/COMESA conference on seed and stored
grain treatment -- progress, prospects and problems in Africa,
which began there today.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA region, which has 20 countries, is estimated to
have a population of 300 million people.
</P>
<P>
Wa Mutharika told participants, including representatives from
COMESA member countries and overseas, that the pre and
post-harvest losses from pests and diseases currently reduced
food availability by 30 to 40 percent or more in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that grain losses alone might amount to over two
million tons per year.
</P>
<P>
"Reducing these losses will significantly cut on grain imports
that have become almost a permanent feature in COMESA," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA chief said that seed dressing over the years had
proved to be one of the most effective and economic methods of
plant protection.
</P>
<P>
"A wide variety of fungal and bacterial diseases such as
mildew, rusts, busts, smuts, blast, and blights could be
controlled in addition to a number of soil borne insects," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the COMESA chief praised the Tanzania Engineering
and Manufacturing Design Organization (TEMDO) and their
counterpart -- the Technology Development and Advisory Unit of
Zambia for successfully developing two models of Machines for a
range of seed and grain treating. The machines are tractor
powered capacity 1.0 - 30 KG and pedal powered capacity 0.2 - 5
KG.
</P>
<P>
Wa Mutharika called for wide use of the machines in the COMESA
region as the machines had been successfully tried by the Mount
Makulu Agricultural Research Station in Chilanga, Zambia, the
Tanzania Pesticides Research Institute in Arusha and Chiedze
Research Station in Lilongwe, Malawi.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the mainstay of the economies of the region
was agriculture, but unfortunately since 1980s up to now
agricultural production had been declining with the result that
most member states of COMESA had to import significant amounts of
food which meant that food insecurity was rampant in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was for this reason that national and regional
strategies accorded the highest priority to attaining food
self-sufficiency, and that agriculture and food production were
accorded the highest priority in COMESA program because of the
majority of member countries depending on it.
</P>
<P>
COMESA's objectives were to create environment for sustainable
growth and development stage by stage approach, the COMESA chief
added.

BAGHDAD, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz met here today with the Chairman of the French-Iraqi
Industrial and Trade Society, Ganu Lakaz, who is currently on a
visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, both sides reviewed friendly relations
between Iraq and France. They expressed the hope for restoring the
bilateral relations to the previous level to serve the common
interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
France, one of the allies of the United States that led a
coalition to drive invading Iraqi forces out of Kuwait after their
several months' occupation, broke its diplomatic ties with Baghdad
in the 1991 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Lakaz is representing the French industrial
and economic circles. Local sources said that he has met with a
number of senior Iraqi officials and discussed cooperation between
French and Iraqi companies in the fields of engineering,
investment, and construction of roads, bridges and residential
quarters.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been working hard to expand economic relations with
France and other countries in a bid to overcome the difficulties
the country has met since the U.N. imposed trade sanctions for its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Has No Objection to Israeli-Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is not affected by an
Israeli-Turkish military agreement and therefore has no reason to
raise any objections, Cyprus' Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides said in a statement that "the content of the
agreement neither turns against us, nor does it affect Cyprus' air
space. Consequently our defense interests, including our joint
defense policy with Greece, are not affected."
</P>
<P>
The statement, which comes a day after a local private TV
channel Sunday reported that an Israeli aircraft violated Nicosia
Flight Information Region, said Cyprus cannot "express objections
and reservations about such an agreement made between third
countries."
</P>
<P>
"We do not aim to block interstate relations, which other
countries have with nations friendly to us, but to encourage
these nations to exert their influence on Turkey to end its
occupation of Cyprus' northern areas," the minister said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement for military cooperation, signed recently
between Israel and Turkey, is an interstate agreement and third
countries cannot interfere in such agreements unless their content
is against them," the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides told the press earlier today the Cyprus government
had requested official briefing from the Israeli government on the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the agreement, government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides said today that "as long as the agreement does not
affect Cyprus, Israel remains a friendly country."
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides dismissed press suggestions that the agreement
allows Turkey to oversee Cyprus' southern coastline.

JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa was likely to
produce a record 2.25 million tons of sugar during this 1996/97
season because of exceptionally good rainfall, according to a
report from the South African Sugar Association today.
</P>
<P>
The country's long-term average was around 2.15 million tons
per year, but rainfall this season would ensure a bumper crop
with exportable surpluses topping 950,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa produced just 1.67 million tons in the
1995/96 season because of poor rains.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated 1.3 million tons are for domestic use each
season.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegate to IPU Advocates Protection of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Delegate said here
today that taking measures to protect the minorities' rights in
light of their characteristics is very important for enhancing
social stability, ethnic harmony and economic development,
promoting world peace, and diversifying the world.
</P>
<P>
Qian Yi, member of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC) of China, made the remarks at the five-day
95th Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) conference which was opened
in Istanbul Monday.
</P>
<P>
Qian said, "Firstly, all parliaments should, in the course
of legislation, treat national or ethnic, religious and
linguistic minorities as equals, prohibit and prevent any
discrimination of them, take special measures to protect their
rights in accordance with their characteristics and practical
difficulties, and restitute their otherwise inalienable
rights. The minorities should be able to enjoy the rights equal
to those of majorities, not only in law, but more importantly, in
reality. To that end, the parliaments must attach importance to
the mutual respect and mutual assistance between ethnic groups,
strongly oppose any propaganda of superior nationalities, ethnic
groups, religions or cultures, and oppose xenophobia and
ultra-nationalism which agitate racial discrimination and ethnic
hatred.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, all parliaments should, in the course of
legislation, give priority to respecting the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of other countries. They should respect the
others' rights to take measures to protect their minority rights
according to the Declaration On The Rights Of Persons Belonging
To National Or Ethnic, Religious And Linguistic Minorities adopted
by the U.N. General Assembly and the provisions in relevant
international instruments, in light of their own national
conditions."
</P>
<P>
She said, "Thirdly, all parliaments should spare no efforts
to popularize the importance of protecting the minority
rights. They should encourage international cooperation, exchange
of experience and drawing upon each other's merits in the field
of the protection of minorities on the basis of equality, so as
to further press ahead this cause."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegate pointed out, "China is a unified
multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-lingual country," adding
that "China's NPC attaches great importance to the question of
ethnic minorities. It defined the fundamental principle and policy
in handling ethnic question as achieving ethnic equality, ethnic
unity, mutual ethnic assistance, regional autonomy of ethnic
minorities and common prosperity. On that basis, a legal system
fitting in with the actual national conditions of China for the
purpose of protecting its ethnic minorities was put into place
and was executed in real earnest.
</P>
<P>
"The Constitution of China provides that Chinese citizens enjoy
freedom of religious belief, and that no state organ, public
organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or
not to believe in, any religion, nor may they discriminate
against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any
religion. As for languages, all nationalities have the freedom to
use and develop their own spoken and written languages. And the
state helped those ethnic minorities without written languages
create their own written languages. Practices have shown that our
relevant laws and measures concerning the protection of ethnic
minorities prove to be successful."

KUWAIT CITY, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Crown Prince and Deputy
Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia, Saudi ah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, today met
in Jeddah with visiting Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Hariri hailed Saudi Arabia's stand toward his country, which
has been subject to Israeli aggression since Thursday, the Saudi
Press Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency did not report the issues discussed in the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia expressed profound concern over the ongoing
Israeli attacks on Lebanon and said that violence only creates
violence.

Israel, during operation of "Grapes of Wrath" which began
Thursday and continued into its sixth day today, has heavily
pounded dozens of Lebanese villages and towns, killing scores of
people, mostly civilians.
</P>

In return, Iran-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, continued to
hurl Soviet-designed Katyusha rockets into Israel's northern
settlements.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today for the first time
voiced its concern over the Israeli onslaught on Lebanon, saying
that the raids had gone beyond a comprehensive operation against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"We are seriously concerned that the Israeli military action
had gone beyond a comprehensive operation and that it could
deliver a blow to the peace process in the Middle East," said
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel.
</P>
<P>
Akbel's statement followed Turkish Foreign Minister Emre
Gonensay's meeting with Lebanese Ambassador to Turkey Cafer
Muhammed Muawi earlier today, who asked for Turkey's help to stop
the Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
"We asked Turkey to launch an initiative, first of all to stop
this aggression, asking Israel to withdraw its forces," Muawi told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese ambassador said that 40 civilians have lost their
lives and 35,000 people in south Lebanon were forced to leave
their homes. Muawi also asked Turkey for humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Ankara's labeling Iran-backed Hezbollah as
"terrorists," the Lebanese envoy said the existence of Hezbollah
in south Lebanon was a direct consequence of the Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, who has shied away from condemning Israel's raids, is
carefully keeping the balance between the Arab states and Israel,
said the local press.

Arab League sources in Cairo said today that the emergency

Arab foreign ministers at the emergency meeting will discuss a

Lebanon's sovereignty and reasserting Lebanon's right to resist
the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution will reiterate the need for Israel to

<HEADLINE> French FM's Visit to Syria "Constructive" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The French Minister of Foreign
Affairs Herve de Charette wound up yesterday evening a visit to
Damascus. Before leaving Damascus, he told reporters that his
talks with Syrian officials were "constructive."
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Syria, de Charette held talks with
President Hafez Assad, as well as with his Syrian counterpart
Farouq el-Shara on the latest developments of the mounting Israeli
aggression against Lebanon and the possibility of coming to an
understanding to secure a ceasefire there.
</P>
<P>
He also conveyed a message from French President Jacques Chirac
to Syrian President Assad on the present state of affairs in
Lebanon and how France and Lebanon should cooperate to tackle it.
</P>
<P>
He also affirmed that France made an initiative intended to
secure a ceasefire in southern Lebanon, and would continue its
efforts in this direction, proceeding from the close ties that
link France with both Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
De Charette's recent visit to Syria came within the mediation
efforts he started with a visit to Israel with the aim of
containing the fighting taking place in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital, the
French mediation is going side by side with intensified American
contacts intended to bring about an understanding to end military
clashes in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The French mediation underlines the necessity of abiding by
the understanding accord concluded in July 1993, while the
American Administration and Israel think that any initiative
intended to halt the fight in Lebanon should include some
amendments to the July 1993 understanding accord.
</P>
<P>
The sources think that the Israeli leadership received support
from the U.S. when the latter prevented the U.N. Security Council
from adopting a fair resolution on the Israeli aggression against
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel thinks of Washington as the sole neutral mediator, while
France is seeking by its mediation to play some role in the Middle
 East peace process and to relax tension in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Though the French initiative met with no response from Israel,
France will continue its mediation efforts intended to secure a
ceasefire in southern Lebanon and to put an end to Israeli
attacks on it.

<HEADLINE> Kathmandu Drug Stores Strike Against Police Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Almost all drug stores in this
capital city of Nepal remained closed today as a national
druggists' organization launched a campaign to protest police
action against its members.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Chemists and Druggists Association asked all its
members to close their shops today to press for the fulfillment of
the demands it put forth earlier to the government.
</P>
<P>
The association had asked the government to stop taking police
action against its members under a narcotic drug control act and
to release and compensate those who had been plunged into prison
or fined.
</P>
<P>
A local court in West Nepal's Kaski district last year fined a
druggist nearly 2,000 US dollars and sentenced him to three years
of imprisonment on charges of selling drugs containing narcotic
and psychotropic elements.
</P>
<P>
Later, several arrests on similar charges were made in other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The druggists association accused the government of taking no
action to solve the problem as drug control law enforcement in the
country operated under a controversial act.
</P>
<P>
Police took action against the druggists selling
narcotic-containing drugs under the 1976 Anti-Narcotic Drug Act,
while a narcotic and psychotropic drug act enacted in 1978 granted
legal permission to sell the same drugs, an official of the Drug
Administration Department said.
</P>
<P>
Closure of drug stores in the town today caused inconvenience
to local consumers. But patients under treatment in hospitals were
unaffected by the strike as most hospitals had their own
dispensaries.

<HEADLINE> EU to Implement Import License System for Some Fruit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Traders of apples, pears and
lemons of European Union (EU) countries have mixed feelings for an
import license system expected to be in effect soon.
</P>
<P>
The European Union Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and
Vegetables decided in late March to implement the license system
and was drafting concrete measures.
</P>
<P>
European Commission (EC) officials said today the new measures
will enter into force seven days after they are adopted by the EC.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, Britain, Sweden, Austria and the European
Union of the Fruit and Vegetable Wholesale, Import and Export
Trade (EUCOFEL) were opposed to the import license system.
</P>
<P>
Under the license system, fruit traders have to apply for a
license and submit a security of 15 ECUs (19.5 U.S. dollars) for
each ton of apples, pears and lemons they plan to import from
outside the EU.
</P>
<P>
The transferable license will remain valid for 40 days and
shows the origin of the fruit produce.
</P>
<P>
The EUCOFEL said some member states regarded the license system
as unnecessary administrative and financial burdens imposed upon
traders, whereas other member states argued that licenses are
needed to monitor imports.
</P>
<P>
France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, the EU's main fruit
exporters, all approved the license system by saying that the
system "will provide information about import flows of these
produce and contribute to better market management."

ISTANBUL, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese delegate said here
today that conserving world fish stocks in order to ensure
continued viability and stability of fishing has become an
important task for all the countries and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the five-day 95th Inter-parliamentary Conference
which opened Monday, He Kang, member of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress (NPC) of China, said: "At present,
although marine fishing remains the bulk of the global fishery
and 70 percent of the world fish stocks have been in
over-exploitation, there are still 800 million mal-nourished

<P>
He said that since the implementation of the reform and
opening-up policy, China's fisheries have entered a stage of
rapid development.
</P>
<P>
China has gradually hammered out and improved the mechanism of
supervision and management regarding the aquatic environment
protection, fishing ports and fishing boats, and also organized
over 30,000 law-enforcement people to supervise and examine the
fishing boats and ports, building step by step the legal
framework for the production and management of fisheries, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out: "The world-wide development of fisheries
should be focused on the development of aquiculture and
reproduction. Different priorities should be pursued by countries
according to their own national conditions. The developed
countries should provide technological and financial support to
the developing countries in developing fisheries and aquiculture,
so as to find more food sources, increase nutrition, upgrade the
people's health, ease up the demand pressure on grains and ensure
a world grain security."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The unexpected surge in western
Europe's new car market which began in January lost much of its
momentum in March, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Provisional statistics from the European Automobile
Manufacturers Association (EAMA) show new car sales in the region
rose a year-on-year 3.1 percent last month, well down from the
10.2 percent in February and nearly 7 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The EAMA forecasts that overall new car sales in the region
this year will be only around 3 percent higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
Sales rose in the month in 12 of the 17 markets monitored, but
the sharp recovery previously seen in Germany, the region's
largest single market by far, had faded.
</P>
<P>
Germany sold 377,000 cars in March, which represented only a
4.5 percent increase over the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Volkswagen retained its market leadership with 16.7
percent of the 1,275,300 vehicles sold in the month, while General
Motors took a distant second with 12.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fiat and Ford tied for the third place, with 11.9 percent,
followed closely by Peugeot/Citroen with 11.8 percent.

The three American servicemen have been sentenced to jail terms
in Japan.

JAKARTA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
allowed the country's private sector to share a significant part
of transportation investments in the Five-Year Development Plan
(1994-1998), reports from a workshop in East Java said today.
</P>
<P>
Transportation Minister Haryanto Danutirto said at the workshop
that the private sector is expected to contribute 44.1 percent of
the total investment of 31 trillion rupiah (13.4 billion US

<P>
According to Haryanto, the government can only contribute 16

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Forty-nine industrial and
technological projects were picked up today to enjoy the
tremendous government financial support in Hong Kong during the
current financial year.
</P>
<P>
The Industry and Technology Development Council (ITDC) today
approved the 49 projects to be financed by the Industrial Support
Fund, which controls 250 million HK dollars (32 million US
dollars) .
</P>
<P>
The total cost for these projects is expected to reach 177
million HK dollars (22.7 million US dollars) over a period of
three years. In the first fiscal year spanning 1996 and 1997,
106.3 million HK dollars (13.6 million US dollars) would be
distributed.
</P>
<P>
Windy Kwok, secretary of the ITDC and assistant
director-general of Industry, said the projects had been approved
based on such objectives as infrastructure support, manpower
training, environmental control, promotion of new technologies,
and development of technology databases and application software.
</P>
<P>
The main criterion is whether there is a genuine need in the
industry for the achievements of the proposed projects.
</P>
<P>
She added that the projects fall in various industrial sectors
ranging from biotechnology to electronics, information, metals,
plastics, textile and clothing.
</P>

The government fund had offered support for 152 projects over
the previous two financial years and 123 projects are continuing
to enjoy the support in the current fiscal year and beyond.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1994, the fund aims at fostering industrial
projects so as to promote the overall industrial or technological
development of Hong Kong and make local manufacturers more
competitive in the global market.

developing relations with Caucasian countries.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> HK Payroll Up 3.8 Percent In Fourth Quarter Of 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The average labor earnings in
Hong Kong recorded an increase of 3.8 percent in real terms in the
 fourth quarter of 1995, according to government statistics
released here today.
</P>
<P>
Employees in the finance, insurance, real estate and business
services sectors saw their payrolls up 7.4 percent on average --
after discounting changes in consumer prices -- the biggest
increase among all major sectors surveyed.
</P>
<P>
The Census and Statistics Department attributed the significant
 rise in part to a low base of comparison in the fourth quarter of
 1994 when the securities and real estate business slackened.
</P>
<P>
Real earnings went up by 5.5 percent for those in the
wholesale, retail, import and export trade, restaurants and hotels
 sectors. Booming external trade underpinned the considerable rise
 in workers' income.
</P>
<P>
The average payroll per person in the manufacturing industry
edged up by 0.8 percent, the slowest growth in all major sectors.
</P>
<P>
The average payroll includes wages and all other irregular
receipts such as bonuses and overtime allowances.

<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The US magazine Business
Week tonight celebrated the 10th anniversary of the launch of its
Chinese edition.
</P>
<P>
John W. Patten, president emeritus of the Business Week Group
of the MacGraw-Hill Companies, said that the Chinese edition, a
joint effort with the International Trade Research Institute
(ITRI) of the Ministry of Foreign Trade &AMP; Economic Cooperation,
has been successful in China, with a total circulation in China
surpassing 60,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the launch of the Chinese version for Business
Week came from his company's belief about China's bright economic
prospects, and that China's economic progress had indeed been
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Chinese economy has been developing at a
double-digit rate but "without causing excessive inflation" in the
past ten years proved that China's economic reform is successful,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"China will be the engine of the future world and will show the
world what sustainable economic growth is," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Fanyong, deputy director of the ITRI, said that the
American weekly has not been turned out in China on a weekly
basis, but on a monthly basis, and that its readers are mainly
from the high echelons of Chinese business world.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Seeks to Curb Revenue Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
pressing ahead with a number of measures to avert revenue losses
incurred by export subsidies, the Department of Finance said
today.
</P>
<P>
While installing "strong" safety nets to ensure subsidies for
exports that generate employment, the government will impose a cap
on the subsidies and set a ceiling on their potential budgetary
cost.
</P>
<P>
A third party will be appointed to verify export revenues
declared by exporters, said the department.
</P>
<P>
A study released earlier by the Department of Finance projected
a revenue loss of between 8 billion pesos (320 million US dollars)
and 11 billion pesos (440 million US dollars) due to export
incentives.
</P>
<P>
The revenue losses, in turn, could undermine the country's
economic performance by swelling the budget deficit "with
consequences for private sector confidence, capital flows, and
investments," the study warned.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Mass Transit
Railway Corporation (MTRC) intends to build an 88-storey office
and hotel landmark at the new airport railway's Kowloon Station
earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
Today's South China Morning Post reported that the office and
hotel complex, overlooking Victoria Harbor, would replace the
78-storey Central Plaza in Wan Chai as Hong Kong's tallest
building.
</P>
<P>
At an estimated cost of 16 billion HK dollars (2 billion US
dollars), the complex will consist of 1.91 million square feet of
office space and a 450-room five-star hotel.
</P>
<P>
The proposed mega-tower was originally scheduled as the seventh
and final phase development of the massive property project above
Kowloon Station.
</P>
<P>
MTRC property director Ho Hang-kwong said the development
program for the skyscraper was now under review and tendering of
the tower was expected to be brought forward, but the exact
schedule had not been decided.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bringing forward the skyscraper's construction
was sensible as it would be a major attraction for the station and
generate commercial and business activities in an otherwise
predominantly residential area.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Pilgrims Arrive at Jeddah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A Libyan Arab Airlines plane
arrived at Jeddah Airport last night carrying 155 pilgrims to
Saudi Arabia in defiance of U.N. sanctions, Libyan Consul in
Jeddah Mlohammed Al-Laffi told Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) today.
</P>
<P>
Laffi affirmed that Major Khwaildy Al-Hmaidi, Member of the
Libyan Revolution Command Council and Head of the Libyan Haj
Mission was aboard the Boeing 727.
</P>
<P>
Unauthorized flights out of tripoli are banned under
U.N. sanctions imposed on Libya for its refusal to hand over for
trial two suspects wanted in connection with the bombing of a
U.S. airliner over lockerbie, scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia last year allowed a Libyan plane carrying 150
pilgrims to Land in Jeddah, drawing strong criticism from the
U.S..
</P>
<P>
The Libyan General Consul asserted that the Saudi Authorities
provided all facilities for the pilgrims headed for Mekka to
perform Haj.
</P>
<P>
On the Libyan violation of air embargo, Laffi said Libyan
pilgrims came to the annual Haj pilgrimage, which this year
reaches its climax around April 28.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the Egyptian traffic controllers at Cairo
International Airport contacted the pilot of the Libyan plane
while in Egyptian airspace to ask him to turn back, but he
refused.
</P>
<P>
Egyptair had airlifted some 5,000 Libyan pilgrims in more than

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan to Continue Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto today reaffirmed the
importance of bilateral relationship that has been in the
spotlight since the rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three
U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Hashimoto signed a joint declaration to redefine
the role of the U.S.-Japanese security arrangement and to expand
security cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
The document noted that the United States will maintain its
current deployment of military personnel in Japan after a thorough
assessment of the overall situation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 47,000 U.S. troops are stationed across Japan, with
more than half of their deployment in the country's southernmost
main island of Okinawa, some 1,600 kilometers southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Okinawan residents were enraged by the rape incident which
happened last September and demanded the U.S. troops turn back to
Japanese landowners the land they have been occupying.
</P>
<P>
The three American servicemen have been sentenced to jail terms
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Clinton's visit, the U.S. military has promised to
return one of its Air Force facilities to local landowners within
next seven years.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held after their talks, Clinton and
Hashimoto said that they had also touched upon other issues of
mutual concern such as trade disputes and worldwide cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president, who arrived in Tokyo Tuesday for a
three-day state visit, had been to South Korea and will leave for
Russia on Thursday to attend in Moscow a nuclear safety summit of
the Group of Seven countries plus Russia and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin's Imports Soar, Exports Shrink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Statistics from the municipal
government of this north China port city showed that during the
first quarter of this year foreign trade stood at nearly five
billion US dollars-worth, up seven percent over the same period in
1995.
</P>
<P>
With rising domestic purchasing prices and new state taxation
policies, imports through Tianjin have seen a rapid increase and
the gap between imports and exports has been narrowed considerably.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months the city's import volume neared 2.4
billion US dollars-worth, which was a rise of 38.6 percent over
the first quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
The city imported large quantities of grain, chemical
fertilizers, steel materials, machinery and electronic products,
and crude oil from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Among them, the imports of machinery and electronics increased
about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the export volume was less than 2.6 billion US
dollars-worth, a decrease of 8.2 percent over the same period of
last year. Exports were only worth 200 million US dollars more
than imports.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also showed that the foreign trade volume of
Sino-overseas joint ventures witnessed remarkable expansion,
reaching 1.68 billion US dollars-worth, up by 53.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The export and import volumes of solely overseas-funded
businesses increased 10.2 percent and 87.9 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded businesses were also found to have been more
involved in processing and exported more finished products,
machinery and electronic items.

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The China Agriculture Development
Bank (CADB) arranged 2.5 billion yuan in loans for agricultural
development in 1995, up 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The loans were used to develop farmland and other natural
resources, and to produce and market products.
</P>
<P>
CADB is one of the three state policy banks in China. It was
established in 1994, and is responsible for supplying and managing
funds for purchasing grains, cotton, edible oil and sideline
products.
</P>
<P>
The bank has extended loans to invigorate about 600
poverty-stricken counties and given special attention to central
and western China, with loans benefiting those regions up nearly
31 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the bank has ensured that no funds for
purchasing agricultural products be used for other purposes and
farmers be paid immediately after selling their products.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this March, CADB arranged more than 478 billion
yuan in loans for purchasing agricultural products and developing
agricultural infrastructural projects.
</P>
<P>
It has cemented good relations with Asian Development Bank,
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and other
international institutions, laying sound basis for opening
overseas business.

<HEADLINE> Manila Offers Incentive to Get GM Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Manila will partly finance a
manufacturing project of US car giant General Motors Corp. (GM) if
the company decides to launch the project in the Philippines, a
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and Thailand are now competing for the site of
the GM's one-billion-US-dollar project to manufacture car
components and assemble cars mainly for exports.
</P>
<P>
The Development Bank of the Philippines and the country's
Social Securities System would provide the financial packages if
the GM finally chooses the Philippines as the site, said Governor
of the Board of Investments Ofelia Bulaong.
</P>
<P>
A GM team is scheduled to arrive here next week to conclude
their talks with Philippine government officials.
</P>
<P>
"Supposedly, this will be the final leg in their decision
making process," said Bulaong.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a car plant either in the Philippines or
Thailand will make the host country a GM production base for car
exports to the region covered by the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
The GM plant is designed to produce 100,000 to 120,000 units
annually, of which 80 percent are geared for exports.
</P>
<P>
The project is in line with the company's policy to capture a
10-percent market share in the APEC region by the year 2005 when
the region's vehicle market is projected to reach 16 million
units.

<HEADLINE> French FM's Visit to Syria "Constructive" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The French Minister of Foreign
Affairs Herve de Charette wound up yesterday evening a visit to
Damascus. Before leaving Damascus, he told reporters that his
talks with Syrian officials were "constructive."
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Syria, de Charette held talks with
President Hafez Assad, as well as with his Syrian counterpart
Farouq el-Shara on the latest developments of the mounting Israeli
aggression against Lebanon and the possibility of coming to an
understanding to secure a ceasefire there.
</P>
<P>
He also conveyed a message from French President Jacques Chirac
to Syrian President Assad on the present state of affairs in
Lebanon and how France and Lebanon should cooperate to tackle it.
</P>
<P>
He also affirmed that France made an initiative intended to
secure a ceasefire in southern Lebanon, and would continue its
efforts in this direction, proceeding from the close ties that
link France with both Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
De Charette's recent visit to Syria came within the mediation
efforts he started with a visit to Israel with the aim of
containing the fighting taking place in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital, the
French mediation is going side by side with intensified American
contacts intended to bring about an understanding to end
military clashes in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The French mediation underlines the necessity of abiding by
the understanding accord concluded in July 1993, while the
American Administration and Israel think that any initiative
intended to halt the fight in Lebanon should include some
amendments to the July 1993 understanding accord.
</P>
<P>
The sources think that the Israeli leadership received support
from the U.S. when the latter prevented the U.N. Security Council
from adopting a fair resolution on the Israeli aggression against
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel thinks of Washington as the sole neutral mediator, while
France is seeking by its mediation to play some role in the Middle
 East peace process and to relax tension in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Though the French initiative met with no response from Israel,
France will continue its mediation efforts intended to secure a
ceasefire in southern Lebanon and to put an end to Israeli
attacks on it.

MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' coconut exports
continued to decline, falling by 23 percent in the first quarter
of 1996 compared with the same period of last year, the Philippine
Coconut Authority (PCA) said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the PCA, export earnings from coconut products
totaled 197.49 million US dollars in the first quarter of 1996 as
against 255.28 million US dollars earned in the previous
corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total volume of coconut exports suffered a
32-percent drop to 380,874 tons as against 560,270 tons.
</P>
<P>
PCA officials attributed the drop to three successive typhoons
that hit the country's coconut growing regions late last year.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Good Business Confidence in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Executives from Hong Kong's key
business sectors are more upbeat about the second quarter compared
with the previous quarter, according to results of a survey by
Knight-Ridder Financial News.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly business confidence report had a survey of more
than 400 firms involved in Hong Kong's four key business
sectors -- financial services, manufacturing, real estate and
retailing.
</P>
<P>
K.K. Chan, chief economist at Japan's Nomura Research
Institute, said that one reason for the brighter outlook is that
major uncertainties associated with Hong Kong's handover to China
on July 1, 1997, as well as the direction of interest rates, would
be resolved by the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The property sector was upbeat, with more respondents expecting
prices and take-up rates to rise over the quarter, partly because
of the pickup in business activity in some sectors.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers were another group whose responses indicated a
higher optimism, with all respondents in this sector saying they
were not worried about operating in Hong Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Christopher D. Howarth, director and company secretary of
Outboard Marine Corporation Asia Ltd, said that his company was
highly confident about Hong Kong's future. As a company with
operations in China, it does not view the handover of Hong Kong as
a threat.
</P>
<P>
The view of finance sector executives is little changed from
the previous quarter, although none of the respondents see
business declining in this quarter.
</P>
<P>
The mood in the retailing sector was the lowest, as only 20
percent of respondents think sales this quarter will be higher,
against 64 percent in the first quarter, the survey found.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Officials from China and the
World Bank vowed today to enhance cooperation and make WB-funded
projects in China produce more benefits.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation between China and the World Bank has been
successful over the past 15 years," Zhu Xian, a Chinese official
with the Ministry of Finance, said while attending a WB-sponsored
meeting in Tianjin to inspect the operation of WB-funded projects
in China.
</P>
<P>
In the future China will make better and more efficient
preparation for WB-funded projects, and the state will promote
contact and understanding between the bank and its Chinese
counterparts in charge of putting the projects into action, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
Hope, an official from the bank, also regarded cooperation
between the two sides as "encouraging", and the projects set a
good example for WB-funded schemes in other countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The bank will establish more contact with China's departments
and enterprises, and help China make a better use of the bank's
loans.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the bank will provide more loans and
technological assistance to China's less developed central and
western parts, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has become one of the important partners of the World
Bank. Since 1981 the bank has funded 157 projects in China with
contracted loans of 22.19 billion US dollars, about 13 billion of
which has arrived in China.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 28 Chinese provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions have used funds from the bank in agriculture, industry,
water conservation, energy, education and environmental
protection. A large number of them are key state projects which
help boost the national economy and improve people's life.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Workers to Say Good-bye to "Iron Rice Bowl" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese workers will say good-bye
to the "iron rice bowl", or the life-long job guarantee system,
within this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a meeting called by the Ministry of Labor on the
readjustment and supervision of labor relations held in Tunxi city
of East China's Anhui Province, the labor contract system, which
was initiated in the middle of the 1980s, will be fully
established across the country except for a few areas and under
special circumstances.
</P>
<P>
This means the end of the permanent job guarantee system, which
was initiated some 40-odd years ago.
</P>
<P>
About 100 million Chinese workers have signed labor contracts
with their employers, accounting for 80 percent of the total
workforce. And 13 provinces and cities have basically established
the labor contract system.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the current labor relations in China are
becoming more diversified and complicated, with an increasing
number of labor disputes arising, which are difficult to deal with.
</P>
<P>
The ministry noted that the problems of providing insurance to
workers in poorly managed enterprises and the settlement of
redundant workers will remain for a long period to come.
</P>
<P>
To solve these problems, the ministry has proposed implementing
the collective consultation and collective contract system so as
to better protect the legitimate rights and interests of workers
and ensure the healthy development of labor relations.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Labor Zhu Jiazhen said that it is imperative
to guide both the employees and employers to standardize their
behavior in accordance with the labor law, regulations and
contracts in order to cut labor disputes from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that efforts must be made to protect the legitimate
rights and interests of both the employees and employers through
the improvement of labor supervision, mediation and arbitration of
labor disputes.
</P>
<P>
At present, the labor contract signing work will be focused on
workers in township and privately-owned enterprises, self-employed
businessmen, and workers in government departments, institutions
and other social organizations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippines' 1996 Economy Starts Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' economy has got
off to a good start for 1996, as key indicators showed encouraging
signs of development in the first quarter, particularly in March.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, President Fidel Ramos
expressed optimism about the country's economy, which is boasting
a slowing down of inflation, a declining jobless rate and the
continued expansion of the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics showed a substantial fall in the
month-to-month inflation rate, which inched slightly by 0.4
percent in March compared with one percent in February.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the one-shot inflationary impact of the oil
price hike, the wage increase and the expanded value added tax has
tapered off in the country.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate dropped to 8.3 percent in January from
8.8 percent a year earlier, with 1.26 million new jobs created in
the past year, significantly above the targeted 1 million jobs per
year.
</P>
<P>
Exports continued to grow, surging by 24.4 percent in February
to reach 3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's top dollar earner was electronics and components,
which rose by 59.7 percent and made up 38.7 percent of the total
earnings of 399 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports of coconut oil amounted to 87 million US dollars and
those of woodcraft and furniture 65 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' imports totaled 2.2 billion US dollars in
January, up 20.4 from the same month of 1995.
</P>
<P>
A survey of key manufacturing enterprises shows that the
manufacturing sector continued to grow, with the value of the
production index going up by 17.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local economic analysts said growth in the manufacturing sector
was spurred by the ongoing expansion in production capacities in
anticipation of increased competition resulting from the pending
deregulation of the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange rate has remained stable at around 26
pesos to the US dollar since March 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of the Philippines has concluded bilateral
repurchase agreements with Indonesia and Singapore in a bid to
maintain the currency stability against speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
The positive development of the country's economy is also
reflected by the bullish trend in the Philippine stock market.
</P>
<P>
The March composite index finished 18.2 points higher than the
February index, closing at 2,900.75 points. It breached the
pivotal 3,000-point mark this week.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Concerned over Israeli Attacks on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
expressed deep concern over the continued attacks by Israel
against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a Foreign Ministry statement received
here today.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "The aggression launched by Israel on the
pretext of retaliatory strikes cannot be justified at all."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attacks have killed a number of people and forced
thousands of others to seek refuge in safer places, while causing
vast material damages to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia's stand remains the same, which is the
implementation of the United Nations Resolution No. 435 by
Israel," it added.
</P>
<P>
With that, the war between the two sides can be stopped
permanently, it added.

<HEADLINE> Proposed Ban on Tobacco Ads Cold shouldered in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's proposed ban on
tobacco advertising hit obstacle Tuesday when the draft bill
received a cool reception from the Executive Council (Exco),
local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Exco members felt the bill was being
rushed through too soon and a ban on direct advertising, followed
by indirect advertising, was extreme, today's South China Morning
Post said.
</P>
<P>
Anti-smoking and public health groups, which have lobbied for
years to get the ban in place, were aghast last night when told
the bill was under threat, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Anthony Hedley of Hong Kong University's Council on
Smoking and Health was quoted as saying "I would like to know to
what extent Exco members were exposed to and lobbied by the
tobacco industry."
</P>
<P>
The Tobacco Institute, which represents companies, has said it
may take the government to court, alleging contravention of
related laws.

<HEADLINE> Israel To Carry on All-round Offensive against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Despite intensive diplomatic
contacts designed to halt fighting, Israel has decided to continue
the Operation Grapes of Wrath against Hezbollah, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after Prime Minister Shimon Peres held
consultations with Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, Chief of the General
Staff, and other senior officers this morning.
</P>
<P>
Today is the seventh day of the operation launched by the
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from April 11, but the IDF and
Hezbollah have shown no signs of ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
A number of Katyusha barrages fell on Upper Galilee and
Galilee Panhandle, north Israel, while Israel mounted air and
artillery fire on the towns of Nabatiya and Sur as well as
villages north of the Israeli self-declared "security zone" in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The military has strongly asserted itself in going on with
the offensive. Giora Inbar, the IDF's top officer in Lebanon,
challenged the prime minister by saying that the
goals of the operation are progressing step by step in
accordance with the plan and the mandate given by the
political level.
</P>
<P>
"We won't allow a situation in which Peres holds us back
(when) we haven't yet finished the job," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Peres told reporters on a tour of the north that he wanted a
written understanding to emerge from diplomatic contacts to end
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
He called for patience saying that there are no guarantees
that the war will come to an end in several days, and he does not
want to raise false expectations.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ehud Barak met in Tel Aviv this morning
with U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indik to discuss a new
understanding to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials say that Israel is interested in an agreement
with Lebanon and indirectly with Syria, but not Hezbollah.

<HEADLINE> China's Most Expensive Stamp to Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A rare Chinese stamp, issued
exclusively for servicemen over 40 years ago, is expected go under
the auctioneer's hammer for at least half a million yuan on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Experts have predicted that the auction price for the blue
military postage stamp which was produced - but never issued - in
1953 will become China's most expensive stamp ever if it reaches
the expected 500,000 yuan ( about US$60,000).
</P>
<P>
A similar kind of stamp, which had chosen the army emblem of
the PLA as its main design, was sold at a recent auction for a
whopping 800,000 yuan (about US$96,000).
</P>
<P>
However the record price failed to win recognition because of
suspicions of cheating.
</P>
<P>
The blue military stamp is one of a three-piece set issued in
1953 to provide a free postal service for men from the armed
services. It was for the special use of naval servicemen, while
the other two, respectively yellow and purple in color, were
designed for use by the ground and air forces.
</P>
<P>
After the yellow and purple stamps had reached the troops,
however, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications found it
difficult to maintain their exclusive use by the soldiers, and
decided to stop the issue.
</P>
<P>
The blue navy stamp, therefore, never even made it onto an
envelope, let alone a postal box. But a tiny few of them found
their way into private hands through mysterious channels.
</P>
<P>
The stamp, highly valued by collectors, however, will remain
unpriced till the forthcoming auction.
</P>
<P>
It is one of some 240 items to be auctioned at the Fine Stamps
and Covers Category of the 1996 Guardian Spring Auction, which is
expecting to raise a total of 4.24 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A collection of most precious Chinese stamps and covers include
a selection of Dragon stamps issued in the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911), the most complete classic Chinese stamps, and a cover
bearing the earliest postmark ever used by the Wenzhou Customs in
east China's Zhejiang Province, which has rewritten the history of
Chinese postmarks.
</P>
<P>
More eye catching might be a stamp with the images of the late
chairman Mao Zedong and Lin Biao, named "Long Live the All-Round
Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution", which has a
sales estimate of 250,000 yuan, the second highest.
</P>
<P>
Guo Xueguang, head of stamps and covers department of the China
Guardian Company, called the stamp sale a first trial of domestic
auctioneers in line with international practices.
</P>
<P>
"More stamps and covers will be auctioned in the future, " he
said, adding that the majority will still be Chinese, because
domestic buyers still cannot afford or appreciate overseas
collections.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest auctioneers in China, Guardian divided its
spring auction into seven categories -- Chinese paintings and
calligraphy, jewelry and jade, rare books, curios, Chinese oil
paintings and sculptures, and the stamps and covers.
</P>
<P>
Some ten stamp auctions are held in China each year, with a
total transaction value of 800,000 to one million yuan. The buyers
are mostly stamp collectors and dealers.
</P>
<P>
China has 400,000 stamp dealers and 18 million registered stamp
collectors.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Develop 10 Industrial Estates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 industrial estates
will be developed in the Philippines' growth areas in
anticipation of shortage of industrial sites for new investors.
</P>
<P>
Gloria Santos, director for infrastructure division of the
Board of Investments (BOI), said today that these projects are
expected to be registered this year either with the BOI or with
the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA).
</P>
<P>
He said that the estimated 12 billion pesos (480 million US
dollars) development cost of the 10 industrial estates involving
3,000 hectares is based on the 400 pesos (16 US dollars)
development cost per square meter.
</P>
<P>
He expected a surge in industrial estate development as
investors were looking for new possible sites, particularly for
projects involving sugar plantation and mills, coconut plantation
and processing, packaging products and petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
The PEZA alone is pushing for the operation for at least 14
economic zones throughout the country this year in anticipation of
the projected shortage in export zones.

<HEADLINE> "China Threat" Fantasy: Russian Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Ambassador to China Igor
A. Rogachev described the "China threat theory" spread by some
people as "an unfounded statement" in a recent interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Rogachev, a veteran diplomat known as a "China hand", said that
China's economic growth and social stability have promoted
security and co-operation in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that a powerful China would safeguard peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region instead of "posing a threat"
to its neighbors or other countries.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador spoke highly of the achievements that China has
made since it adopted the reform and opening-up policies. China
has scored great progress in the fields of industry, agriculture,
communications, and science and technology, and the country has
become one of the nations with the fastest economic growth in the
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China has unavoidably met with some
difficulties in its development process, such as the problems in
economic structure, energy shortage, economic gap between inland
and coastal areas, weak agricultural foundation, population
pressure and anti-corruption struggle.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador noted that there are many "experienced economic
experts" among Chinese senior officials and said he thought that
they would find ways to overcome the above-mentioned difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Rogachev also told Xinhua that he had seriously studied China's
Ninth Five-Year Plan and its long-term goals for the year 2010,
adopted not long ago by China's National People's Congress. "We
have no doubt that the Chinese people will realize these goals as
a result of their strenuous efforts," he said.

<HEADLINE> RMAF Jet Crashes, Pilot Pulled out Unhurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A Royal Malaysian Air Force
(RMAF) F-5E jet fighter crashed today at Kuantan RMAF base, and
the pilot was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
A statement released here by the Malaysian Defense Ministry
said the F-5E fighter crashed at the end of the runway when it
caught fire and rammed into the safety barrier net.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old pilot, Lt. Saiful Johar Abdul Latip, was pulled
out of the burning plane by RMAF rescue unit members. He was
under observation at the base's medical center although he did not
suffer any injuries, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the incident occurred at 2:33 p.m. local
time (0633 GMT) while the plane was getting ready for take-off.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Saiful Johar reportedly alerted the control tower that he
could not proceed with his mission, and the tower personnel
managed to raise the safety net just in time to stop the plane.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force did not disclose the cause of the incident or
weather the jet carried any weapons but said an inquiry board had
been set up.
</P>
<P>
The US-made supersonic Northrop F-5E was to take part in an
exercise code-named "Jagguh" (Champion). The 17-day exercise,
scheduled to end on Saturday, is involving live firing with
rockets and ammunition at targets.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 F-5E jets are still being flown by the RMAF, which
began using them in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Today's crash is the second one in just a week. On Monday, an
RMAF Aermacchi MB-339 jet trainer crashed into the South China Sea
and two pilots managed to eject to safety.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares
Boueiz arrived here today to attend an emergency meeting of the
Arab League (AL) foreign minister ministers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is due to be held at the AL headquarters later
today.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival in Cairo, the Lebanese official told reporters
that an international move was being made on the repeated Israeli
attacks on Lebanon, and that there were several initiatives in
this connection.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed U.S. initiative still involves some loopholes.
This initiative offers a new mechanism which is feared by
Lebanon to be an alternative to the UN Security Council
Resolution 425, and to the peace process," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister pointed out that the emergency
meeting is of crucial importance, as it will put forward the
cause of Lebanon to all Arab states, and will make clear the
Israeli attacks on Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
On whether the Lebanese government has any intention to
dissolve the Hezbollah (Party of God) organization, Boueiz
said: "Lebanon is a democratic country. Hezbollah, like any other
political party, can be dissolved only on conditions."
</P>
<P>
"So long as part of Lebanese territory is occupied by Israel,
resistance is legal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on why the Lebanese army fails to counter
the Israeli attacks, Boueiz said: "The Lebanese army is doing its
duty within its humble potentialities, compared with the Israeli
army and its updated arsenal."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 17 (Xinhua) -- France has decided to take some
measures to ease the ordeal of the Lebanon, part of which is under
severe Israeli bombardments and shelling.
</P>
<P>
This move was announced by French Foreign Minister Herve De
Charette here Tuesday night after a three-hour meeting with
Lebanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said he would continue his peace mission in the
Middle East, which was entrusted to him by French President
Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
De Charette, who arrived in Beirut from Damascus Tuesday night
and soon entered into talks with the Lebanese leaders, said that
France totally understood "pains and ordeals Lebanon is
suffering."
</P>
<P>
He announced that France had decided to take some measures to
ease the pains, including sending humanitarian assistances to
Lebanon, and helping Lebanon repair some installations wrecked in
the Israeli air raids in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The meeting started at 8:45 p.m. (1745 GMT) in the
Presidential Palace with the attendance of Lebanese House Speaker
Nabih Berri, Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz and French Ambassador
to Lebanon Jean-Pierre Lafon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri, who returned home
after a four-day trip to Syria, Egypt, France, Morocco and Saudi
Arabia, joined the meeting at 10:05 p.m. (19:05 GMT).
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following the meeting, the French foreign
minister announced that France would put forward in the next few

of State Warren Christopher to coordinate the efforts to ease the
tension in south Lebanon. He said that he had also contacted
France's European partners and the Iranian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Berri accused the Jewish state of "attempting to exert
pressure upon us by cutting all humanitarian means until no
nutritions arriving, or by cutting the roads, out of the
consideration that this will force Lebanon to bend and to yield."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz underlined that there were not French or American plans
but an international concern for a halt to the deterioration of
situation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's "Voice of Lebanon" radio quoted Well-informed sources
reporting that the U.S. proposal contains the following
points: stopping military operations and violence, especially
Katyusha rocket attacks at northern Israel; curbing the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah or Party of God; deploying the Lebanese
troops in parts of south Lebanon to safeguard the security; Syria
making a written guarantee on an implementation of this agreement.

at about 4:00 a.m. today on its way back home.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Seek Military Assistance from Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares
Boueiz said here today that Lebanon would possibly ask for
"military assistances" from Syria and other Arab countries to
confront the current Israeli aggressions, which have been
continuing since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure for Cairo to participate in an urgent
meeting of the Arab League (AL), the Lebanese foreign minister
announced that "there is an intention to ask for military
assistances from Syria or other Arab brotherly countries to
confront the Israeli aggressions."
</P>
<P>
The AL council meeting is to be held later today at a request
of Lebanon in view of the current crisis in this country.

<P>
Talking to reporters at the Beirut International Airport, the
Lebanese foreign minister announced lebanon's refusal of a U.S.
proposal on a ceasefire in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the refusal "resulted from Lebanon's fear that
this proposal would become a mechanism replacing the (U.N.
Security Council) resolution 425," which calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Richard Johns conveyed the U.S. proposal to
the Lebanese foreign minister Tuesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Russia-China Co-operation Bolsters World Stability: Rogachev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia and China are conducting
good co-operation on a number of major international issues, which
plays an important role in maintaining world peace and stability,
Russian Ambassador to China Igor A. Rogachev said in a recent
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China, as permanent members of the UN Security
Council and countries possessing nuclear weapons, exert major
influences on international affairs, Rogachev said, adding that
the two countries maintain frequent consultations and exchanges of
information in many organs of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"There are also regular political dialogues between Moscow and
Beijing, in which the two sides discuss regional and international
issues of common concern. I can say that there are no
international issues about which we have not exchanged opinions,"
the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Rogachev voiced his satisfaction about Russia-China ties over
the past few years. He revealed that the entourage of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, who is expected to visit China from April
24 to 26, will include the Russian foreign minister and other
senior officials. The two sides are to sign a series of important
documents and agreements concerning politics, economy and other
fields, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The border agreement which will be signed in Shanghai by
Russia, China and three other neighboring countries will also be
of great significance, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on bilateral economic and trade ties, Rogachev noted
that the bilateral trade volume hit 5.5 billion US dollars-worth
last year after a decline in 1994. The two sides have realized
that barter does not accord with the demands of modern trade and
has begun to change to cash trade, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also adopted some new forms of co-operation,
such as joint production, mutual investment and technology
investment. In addition, they are trying to establish free trade
zones, banks and arbitration organs in their border areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador held that Russia-China trade ties, holding large
potential, would see great progress in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the fact that there exist no political barriers to
the growth of Russia-China ties.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Russia-China border issues, Rogachev said that
Russian President Yeltsin issued an order not long ago, saying
explicitly that Russia would carry out its commitments according
to the border agreement signed by the two countries in May
1991. The Russian government will not budge from this point, the
ambassador stressed.

finister pointed out that France had a suggestion in this regard

<HEADLINE> Australian Wheat Price Expected to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian wheat price is
expected to rise by 10 percent when the next harvest hits market.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Wheat Board (AWB), which monopolies the
country's wheat exports, is to lift the estimate of the wheat
price from the current 200 Australian dollars (158 US dollars) per
ton to 220 Australian dollars (174 US dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest ever estimate of the wheat price made by
the AWB early in the year.
</P>
<P>
The next Australian wheat harvest is expected to hit the market
around December. The world grain stock is expected to drop to the
lowest level in history when wheat harvest of the North Hemisphere
is available in June.
</P>
<P>
In the futures market, the Australian wheat price has already
been pushed up to 245 Australian dollars (193.55 US dollars) per
ton.

<P>
The American wheat price has also reached a 25-year high of 220
US dollars a ton.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan IEC Asked To Extend Voters' Register </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Interim Electoral Commission
(IEC) of Uganda has been asked to find a way to enable people who
failed to pick up their voter's cards to use their votes in the
forthcoming presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The requirement, according to the local daily "The New Vision"
here today, was made by jaberi Bidandi Ssali of Yoweri Museveni
campaign task force at a meeting of the Consultative
Committee for Presidential Campaigns (CCPC) held yesterday at the IEC
headquarters in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Ssali said so long as would-be voters are on the register,
they should not be penalized for failing to pick up their cards.
</P>
<P>
The law requires a person to be registered as a voter, having
his or her name on the voter's register and possess a valid
voter's card.
</P>
<P>
Ssali pointed out that because people are voting for the first
time in the presidential elections in Uganda, some concessions
should be made without undermining the integrity of the system.
</P>
<P>
He observed that more than half of Uganda's eligible voters
may not have a say in who should be president if the IEC does not
take immediate action to avail voters' cards to those people who
registered but never picked up cards.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Lifts Ban On Nigerian Pilgrims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The suspension of further airlift
of Nigerian pilgrims to Saudi Arabia announced about a week ago
on health grounds has been lifted by the Saudi authorities,
according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the airlift of pilgrims to the Holy Land resumed
last night.
</P>
<P>
Eight days ago,the Saudi government announced the ban on
Nigerian pilgrims from performing this year's holy pilgrimage to
Mecca as a result of cases of epidemic of cerebro-spinal
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
The restriction was later extended to other West African
countries of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso for the same cause.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, Nigeria has sent an eight-member
delegation to Saudi Arabia. Now the team's mission was
successful, said Alhaji Ado Bayero, the leader of the delegation,
after briefing the head of state General Sani Abacha in the
capital of Abuja yesterday.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that about 21,000 intending pilgrims in the
country are expecting to be airlifted to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Before the suspension was announced, some 3,000 Nigerian
pilgrims had arrived in the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
Currently, they are performing their hajj rites like any other
pilgrims, Bayero said.

<HEADLINE> Russians Show Growing Interest in Touring China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China International Travel
Service Head Office (CITSHO), the country's largest travel agency,
is scheduled to receive a group of Russian sightseers at the end
of this month, thus ending its history of catering to
shopping-oriented Russian tourists only.
</P>
<P>
This is perhaps not only a major turning point for the agency,
but also for China's tourism industry as a whole, analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Russian tourist arrivals to
China topped 489,000 in 1995, making Russia the fourth-largest
source country after Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United
States. However, most of these Russians came to buy commodities
which they could sell back home, and many of them were too busy to
go sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
For example, China Comfort Travel Service Head Office, which
pioneered the Russian market, received over 170 chartered tourist
planes from Russia bringing in over 70,000 tourists in 1995. But
only around 600 were sightseers.
</P>
<P>
"For various reasons we've not adequately tapped the great
potential of the Russian sightseeing market. But I believe the
prospects for the market are bright," said Li Huiyang, executive
deputy director of the Second European Sales Dept. of CITSHO, in
an interview with Xinhua. He was just back from an international
tourism fair in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Li's remarks coincided with a poll conducted by the Russian
International and Social Affairs Research Center from March 19 to
April 5, which showed that 75 percent of the respondents were keen
to visit China.

<TEXT>
<P>
Li said that another optimistic sign is that every month so
far this year his department has received a group composed of
Russian primary and middle school students who have shown strong
interest in Chinese culture and education.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that more and more Russians will come in the next two
years. Now we're busy training Russian-speaking guides", he said.
</P>
<P>
The increasing Russian tourist arrivals in recent years have
paved the way for further expansion of the market, Chinese market
analysts have pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Russians who came to China to do business have cultivated
their interest in the country, and many of them are returning as
tourists. A large number of travellers catered to by the China
Comfort Travel Service Head Office belong to this category, said
Dong Ruping, the assistant general manager of the agency.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is allowing five Beijing-based travel
agencies to offer free-visa arrangements to organized Russian tour
groups. All of them are geared up for further market expansion.
</P>
<P>
The China National Tourism Administration predicts that the
annual tourist arrivals from Russia from now on could reach
550,000 in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"We always attach great importance to developing the tourism
source markets in neighboring countries, including Russia," said
Bai Zhiqiang, a spokesman for the administration's marketing
dept.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Citrus Exports To Rise This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Southern African citrus exports
are expected to grow at least five percent this year to 44
million cartons worth 500 million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of Outspan International, a company
coordinating the exports, John Stanbury said here today that
shipments could actually rise to 50 million cartons, boosting
sales to 556 million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a record 41.7 million cartons were exported to 60

Early indications were that the northern hemisphere citrus
season might end early, which will open the market for southern

HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Law Students
Association on Tuesday condemned the destruction of property and
looting of food by the students of the University of Zimbabwe on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 rioting students protested against a 33 percent rise

affairs offices, a linic and supermarket and broke into dining
halls to loot food.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Tuesday, leader of the association Joannes
Mhlanga urged the university authorities to take disciplinary
action against the Students Representative Council for allegedly
inciting the violence.
</P>
<P>
''We condemn the looting and destruction of property that has
taken place. This should not be condoned and we urge the
university administration to take disciplinary action against
people who perpetrated the demonstration which led to the
destruction,'' he said.

<P>
Two students were arrested over the incident and three

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Steps up Exploitation of Wind Energy Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The government of northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is planning to invest
huge amounts of capital to build a group of power plants with
total capacity of 600,000 kw by taking advantage of its abundant
wind energy resources.
</P>
<P>
According to an official in charge of the region's energy
resources, the region has nine areas of strong wind, totalling
150,000 sq km, which are sufficient for producing a total
installed generating capacity of 150 million kw and an annual
electricity output of 800 billion kwh.
</P>
<P>
In line with the regional wind power development plan, priority
will be given to building or expanding five wind-power stations in
the suburbs of this capital of Xinjiang, by the turn of the
century. In addition, 5,000 wind-driven generators will be set up
in remote farming and pastoral areas, so as to bring the
wind-driven generating capacity in the region to a total of
135,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile by the year 2010 Xinjiang will build a group of wind
power stations in the areas of Tacheng, Karamay and the Alataw
Pass in the western part of the Junggar Basin, including the
development of 8,000 small wind-driven generators, which are
expected to enhance the region's wind-driven generating capacity
to 600,000 kw and produce an annual electricity output of 2.04
billion kwh.
</P>
<P>
These figures will represent 5.6 percent and four percent,
respectively, of the region's total generating capacity and annual
electricity output by that time.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the region started the development of
wind-power stations in the late 1980s by taking advantage of three
million US dollars given gratis by the government of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
By 1995 Xinjiang had developed a total wind-driven generating
capacity of 30,000 kw with an annual electricity output of 45
million kwh.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Seeks to Sell 3 Million Cars Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Nissan Motor Co., the second
largest automaker in Japan, plans to sell 3 million vehicles
globally for the current business year to regain profitability.
</P>
<P>
"We'll turn a profit if we sell 1.2 million vehicles at home
and 1.8 million overseas," Kyodo News Service quoted Nissan
President Yoshifumi Tsuji as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tsuji noted that the company will lose out in terms of price
competition unless it reduces costs by selling a total of 3
million vehicles throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The major automaker posted a pretax loss of 61 billion yen
(roughly 564.8 million U.S. dollars) in fiscal 1994, and has
predicted it would break even for the 1995 business year.
</P>
<P>
The business results for fiscal 1995 will be released in
May. During the fiscal year which ended March 31, Nissan sold
about 1.12 million vehicles in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Tsuji said that domestic car sales during the year fell short
of the projection of 20,000 to 30,000 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Nissan's domestic market share grew by 0.7 percentage point in
fiscal 1995 from the previous year to 21.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Final Status Talks on West Bank to Begin in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official
said here late Tuesday night that negotiations with the
Palestinians on final status of the West Bank will begin as
scheduled on May 4, in accordance with the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio today quoted the official as saying that the
talks would start on time, thereby resuming Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks halted after the wave of suicide bus bombings in
February and March.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, the final status talks are
to begin on May 4, and conclude in May 1999. However,
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said earlier this month
the final status agreement would be brought to a national
referendum before implemented.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Peres and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat will announce the
resumption of peace talks when they meet Thursday at the
Erez Crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it will be the first meeting between
Peres and Arafat since the suicide bombing attacks which
killed at least 60 people and wounded more than 150 others.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the suicide bombing attacks by Hamas, Israel
halted all negotiations with the PNA, and has imposed a total
closure on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Peres, Arafat is expected to demand a lift
of the closure, which has barred tens of thousands of Palestinian
workers from returning to their jobs inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Another Key issue at their meeting is whether Israel will
redeploy its troops from the West Bank town of Hebron before the
Knesset (Israel's parliament) elections, scheduled to be held on
May 29.
</P>
<P>
Israel has postponed its withdrawal from Hebron, which was
originally scheduled to be completed on March 28.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that Israel would not pull back from Hebron until
after the Palestinian National Council (PNC) changes the clause in
the Palestinian Covenant, which calls for the destruction of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
In addition to that, Peres demand the PNA arrest all Hamas
fugitives such as Mohammed Dief, head of Izzadin Kassam, the
military wing of Hamas.

ZHENGZHOU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Ports of entry have given Henan
Province a helping hand in competing with coastal and border
areas, or those near rivers in developing foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The province now has seven ports of entry for land transport,
putting it first among China's inland provinces.
</P>
<P>
Last year, highways in Zhengzhou, the provincial capital,
handled a total of 2,700 TEUs of import and export containers, as
well as more than 6,800 tons of cargo.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a new highway port of entry in Zhengzhou,
involving a total investment of 270 million yuan, has been
accelerated. After completion, it will be the largest
state-of-the-art road port in China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Local port authorities told Xinhua that the procedures at these
ports have been greatly simplified, with customs, safety
inspections, and quarantine checks being completed on the spot.
</P>
<P>
They say that a port network, mainly including the four land
transport hubs of Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Shangqiu, and Nanyang, is
expected to take shape next year.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Specialized Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Developing specialized
agriculture will be one of China's top tasks over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
"We have gathered large amounts of funds for departments at
every level to this end," said an official with the Ministry of
Finance.
</P>
<P>
Last year the first group of 22 pilot specialized agricultural
projects received 177 million yuan in investment, of which 83
million came from the central government.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is expected to invest more widely in specialized
agriculture, he said. "We'll not only aid individual farmers but
will help state-own agricultural concerns upgrade their
operational mechanism and get better returns."
</P>
<P>
In addition to farming and animal husbandry, China will develop
aquatic cultivation into an independent industry so as to make
better use of its rich water resources.
</P>
<P>
Local departments have been advised that the specialised
projects must have ready domestic and overseas markets and rich
natural sources, and apply advanced management and technology,
said the official.
</P>
<P>

<P>
HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Polish Minister for International
Economic Cooperation Jacek Buchacz will arrive in Zimbabwe on
April 24 for a three-day visit to discuss ways of increasing
economic and trade relations with the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
A high-rank official of the Polish Embassy in Harare said on

Zimbabwean government ministers as well as local businessmen keen
to trade with Poland.
</P>
<P>
Buchacz's visit, the first by a polish government minister in
the past several years, comes in the wake of reports that Warsaw
had submitted a draft investment protection agreement for
consideration by the Zimbabwean authorities.
</P>
<P>
The current two-way trade between Zimbabwe and Poland exceeds
22 million US Dollars annually, with the balance tilted in
Zimbabwe's favor, mainly due to the high volume of tobacco
exports.

<HEADLINE> Provincial Leader Helps Blind Boy Resume Schooling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Yi Xueqing, a 17-year-old blind
boy, will never forget November 16, 1994, when he was informed
that he could return to the Taiyuan School for the Blind in this
capital of north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Hu Fuguo, a senior provincial leader, had donated 1,000 yuan to
pay the tuition fees for the boy.
</P>
<P>
Yi lives in Changle Village, Longju Township, on the outskirts
of Yuncheng City in southern Shanxi. His mother died when he was
ten and his father has to support him and his four sisters by
farming.
</P>
<P>
Yi often says, "Though I am blind, I want to become a person
useful to society."
</P>
<P>
Supported by his family, in 1991 he entered the Taiyuan School
for the Blind, the only school with a nine-year course for blind
children in Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
When he returned home for the summer vacation in 1994 his
father told him: "My boy, I am terribly sorry, but I really cannot
afford to pay for your tuition any longer. You'd better come back
and tend the sheep."
</P>
<P>
The boy thereupon decided to teach himself. He wrote to his
teachers, asking them to help him with his studies and mail
textbooks to him. He also asked them to permit him to take the
school's final exams.
</P>
<P>
Three months had passed since Yi Xueqing returned home. Then,
suddenly, on November 16, 1994, the school informed him that he
could resume his studies immediately.
</P>
<P>
The change in the boy's fortunes came about on October 22,
1994, the 36th anniversary of the founding of the Taiyuan School
for the Blind. Hu Fuguo, secretary of the Shanxi Provincial
Committee of the Communist Party of China, came to the school to
attend a ceremony to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Tears streamed down Hu's cheeks as he watched a drama performed
by blind children concerning Yi Xueqing's dropping out of the
school. He asked Principal Sun Jinyan: "Who is this boy? Where is
he now? Please tell me his name and address. I am going to help
him resume his studies."
</P>
<P>
A few days later he sent 1,000 yuan to the school to pay Yi's
tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Yi returned to his teachers and classmates. At a
ceremony to mark the 37th anniversary of the founding of the
school in 1995 he sang a song titled "Returning to the Campus",
which goes: "As I return to the campus with spring in the
air ... a warmth is stirring in my heart and I have too many words
of gratitude to say ... I will never forget the Party's loving
kindness.... I will always bear in mind Secretary Hu's care for
me. today I study happily at school ... I will certainly live up
to your expectations, work hard, make progress every day and
acquire skills to win honor for the motherland!"
</P>
<P>
Patting Yi on his shoulder, Hu Fuguo told him: "You are a very
promising child. You will certainly be able to finish your
studies. Whenever you encounter any difficulty, just let me know
and I will do all I can to help you."
</P>
<P>
"I have no worries now. The rest of my tuition fees have been
paid for by `Project Hope' (a project undertaken nationwide to
finance the schooling of poor children) and my living expenses are
borne by the school," Yi said.
</P>
<P>
Before the Mid-Autumn Festival (the 15th day of the eighth
lunar month) Hu sent 100 yuan to Yi. While in hospital, he
inquired from Principal Sun Jinyan about how the blind children
were getting on with their studies.
</P>
<P>
On learning that the school's teaching conditions had improved
substantially and that Yi Xueqing was one of the brightest
students in his class, Hu said, "Very good! I resolutely support
you!"

<P>
JINAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Had it not been for China's
reforms, Guan Qinlu, a 29-year-old graduate in the coastal city of
Qingdao, would never have found himself competing for a government
position by taking part in a public service exam.
</P>
<P>
But, the government of Qingdao City, a coastal resort in east
China's Shandong Province, has decided to find a method of getting
young, competent officials.
</P>
<P>
"China's officials used to be selected in a semi-public way,
but with the shift from a planned economy to the present market
economy, a fairer and more public selection method is being
tried," Hu Yanshen, director of the Examination Committee,
explained.
</P>
<P>
More than half the applicants are below the age of 35, and 22
percent of the applicants have graduate degrees.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the city government predicts that with
the development of the socialist market economy, new methods that
can help promote young and competent officials will be developed
and used across the country.

<HEADLINE> France Pledges to Help Ease Lebanon's Ordeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 17 (Xinhua) -- France has decided to take some
measures to ease the ordeal of the Lebanon, part of which is under
severe Israeli bombardments and shelling.
</P>
<P>
This move was announced by French Foreign Minister Herve De
Charette here Tuesday night after a three-hour meeting with
Lebanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said he would continue his peace mission in the
Middle East, which was entrusted to him by French President
Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
De Charette, who arrived in Beirut from Damascus Tuesday night
and soon entered into talks with the Lebanese leaders, said that
France totally understood "pains and ordeals Lebanon is
suffering."
</P>
<P>
He announced that France had decided to take some measures to
ease the pains, including sending humanitarian assistances to
Lebanon, and helping Lebanon repair some installations wrecked in
the Israeli air raids in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The meeting started at 8:45 p.m. (1745 GMT) in the
Presidential Palace with the attendance of Lebanese House Speaker
Nabih Berri, Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz and French Ambassador
to Lebanon Jean-Pierre Lafon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri, who returned home
after a four-day trip to Syria, Egypt, France, Morocco and Saudi
Arabia, joined the meeting at 10:05 p.m. (19:05 GMT).
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following the meeting, the French foreign
minister announced that France would put forward in the next few
hours "certain suggestions" to the parties concerned in light of
the outcome of his trip in the region.
</P>
<P>
De Charette noted France will work for a solution to the
crisises, saying that urgent measures must be taken to facilitate
the return of peace and to put an end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He announced that he would continue his mission and wound go
back to Tel Aviv at Wednesday morning to brief Israeli officials
on his discussions in Damascus and Beirut, and to look into the
French proposal.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said that he had made a contact with U.S. Secretary
of State Warren Christopher to coordinate the efforts to ease the
tension in south Lebanon. He said that he had also contacted
France's European partners and the Iranian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Berri accused the Jewish state of "attempting to exert
pressure upon us by cutting all humanitarian means until no
nutritions arriving, or by cutting the roads, out of the
consideration that this will force Lebanon to bend and to yield."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz underlined that there were not French or American plans
but an international concern for a halt to the deterioration of
situation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's "Voice of Lebanon" radio quoted Well-informed sources
reporting that the U.S. proposal contains the following
points: stopping military operations and violence, especially
Katyusha rocket attacks at northern Israel; curbing the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah or Party of God; deploying the Lebanese
troops in parts of south Lebanon to safeguard the security; Syria
making a written guarantee on an implementation of this agreement.

CHONGQING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 college
graduates from the Three Gorges area have found jobs in the
coastal provinces of Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong and Zhejiang,
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The move is the result of local government efforts in these
provinces to respond to the State Council's call on supporting
settlement of people from the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
Due to population density and slow economic development,
college graduates find it difficult finding jobs in the gorges
area.
</P>
<P>
In the coastal provinces most college graduates from the gorges
area are provided jobs at urban work units which have better
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The provinces have also allocated funds to support education in

<HEADLINE> Flow of Transients Made Orderly (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's plan for the
"comprehensive management of the migrant rural population", which
was started last year, has been effective in controlling the
random flow of rural surplus laborers into the booming cities, and
has helped maintain the nation's overall social stability.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing and Shanghai cities, and Zhejiang and Hubei
provinces, where the scheme is being better implemented, "orderly
migration of such people has been basically achieved," the
"Legal Daily" reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of rural people on the move, reaching
nearly 30 million last year, has been blamed by the media and the
public as one of the factors resulting in the rising urban crime
rates.
</P>
<P>
The scheme was jointly started by the Central Committee for
Comprehensive Management of Public Security, the Public Security
Ministry and the Labor Ministry at a national conference in July
1995.
</P>
<P>
The Public Security Ministry issued two rules on rural people
renting rooms in urban areas, and on applying for temporary
residence permits last year.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 provinces, autonomous regions and major cities have
made local regulations on controlling transients, and a dozen
provinces have drawn up rules on renting out accommodation to
rural people, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Public security bureaus nationwide have helped to establish
specialized agencies to deal with migrant workers in most urban
neighborhood committees, streets, villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that Beijing, which has a total of 384 street and
township divisions, has set up 365 leading groups on managing
migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has 32,000 people employed to do this job, and Hubei
Province has 14,000 registration centers for migrant laborers,
and another 14,000 stations to maintain public order in places
with large population of migrants.

<P>
In addition to intensified management work, public security
departments have launched special crackdowns on illegal dwellings
and recreational centers where migrants gather and which are
thought to be hotbeds of crime.
</P>
<P>
A large number of criminal cases have been cracked there, the
"Legal Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
A complete framework for managing migrant workers, ranging from
application, registration, issuing residential cards to
confirmation, consultation and charging fees, has been basically
formed.
</P>
<P>
Jilin, Zhejiang, Hubei and Hunan provinces have gone a step
further to establish a system of keeping track of the movements of
migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
The Public Security Ministry plans to implement a unified
registration system for transients, and has started to develop a
computerized system on transient data.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Labor Ministry promotes the orderly
migration of rural surplus labors by means of improving the labor
market.
</P>
<P>
A basic trans-regional employment system based on labor demand
and supply, a nationwide labor market data system and service
networks across the country have been established.
</P>
<P>
These will be further improved this year to control the
trans-provincial migration scale at 30 million people.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public
Security is the coordinator for various departments on matters
relating to orderly migration of rural laborers.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Cases Increase 3 Percent in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of cancer overall
has increased by three percent a year since 1989 in Australia,
there were an estimated 70,000 cases in the country last year.
</P>
<P>
A study by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
reveals that the most common causes of cancer death remain lung
and bowel cancer in men, and breast and bowel cancer in women.
</P>
<P>
While prostate cancer, with the highest incidence rate, has
overtaken lung cancer as the most common life-threatening cancer
for men with the number of new diagnosed cases estimated to have
increased 2.3 times in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, there were 15,448 new cases of
prostate cancer diagnosed last year, more than double the 6,730
cases diagnosed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Though the incidence of prostate cancer has risen dramatically,
the number of deaths it causes is estimated to have risen only
slightly from 2,142 in 1991 to 2,670 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The reason for this trend was believed to be improved detection
rates brought about by the use of the relatively new
prostate-specific antigen tests.
</P>
<P>
The study says that prostate cancer now makes up 18 percent of
all new life-threatening cancers in men, followed by lung cancer
and bowel cancer (15 percent respectively) and melanoma skin
cancer (10 percent).
</P>
<P>
Breast cancer is by far the most common cancer in women, making
up 26 percent of all new cases, followed by bowel cancer (15
percent) and melanoma skin cancer (10 percent).
</P>
<P>
The report notes that although smoking is still one of the
primary causes of all cancers, but notably the incidence of lung
cancer in men is estimated to have been in steady decline since
1992, reflecting declining smoking rates over the past few years.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- 160 rebels of the West Nile Bank
Front (WNBF) have surrendered since last month to the Uganda
People's Defense Forces (UPDF) and local government in Arua
district, northwestern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said over 50 guns were captured.
</P>
<P>
The WNBF rebels entered Uganda through Zaire last month, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
UPDF officials were quoted as saying that some young people
had been lured to Sudan to fight as a mercenary army and promised
over 500 US Dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
The officials said, "many have realized that they were being
fooled. They have never seen a Shilling since they went there."
</P>
<P>
WNBF rebels, led by Juma Oris, first surfaced in May, 1995 in
northern Uganda with an aim to topple the current Ugandan
government and to reinstall former president Idi Amin who was
toppled in 1979.
</P>
<P>
WNBF of Oris, former Amin's aide, has 1000 men who now based
in southern Sudan.

<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang said here today that it is illegal and
invalid for Viet Nam to empower foreign oil companies to explore
oil in the disputed area of the south China sea.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the Viet Nam's recent action of
empowering an American oil company to prospect oil at the disputed
area of the south China sea, Shen reiterated China's indisputable
rights over the Nansha islands and the adjacent waters.
</P>
<P>
"Viet Nam's approval of foreign companies for oil exploration
in the south China sea is illegal and invalid, and infringes upon
China's sovereignty over its territory and maritime rights and

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Co-operation Will Develop Tumen River Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen
co-operation with the Russian Federation in developing the lower
reaches of the Tumen River in order to benefit people in the
Northeast Asia region.
</P>
<P>
Ding Shisheng, deputy secretary-general of the Jilin provincial
government and director of the office in charge of the development
of the Tumen River area, said that China plans to open
international train services from this provincial capital, to
Vladivostok, via Hunchun and Yanji after the joining of the
Chinese and Russian railway systems.
</P>
<P>
At the proposal of Chinese experts, the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) began, in 1991, to promote the
development of the Tumen River delta, an area bordering on China,
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Russia, into a
transportation, industrial, commercial and banking center.
</P>
<P>
Since last year the Russian government has called on related
departments to support the joining of the two railway systems, and
encouraged Chinese investment in jointly building ports in the
delta.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw China open a container shipping route from
Hunchun to Japan and the Republic of Korea via Russian ports, and
export 10,000 tons of cargo via Zorubino and Vladivostok.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has demanded its localities to reduce
charges, put through the railway to the Chinese border, and build
a highway to make it more convenient for China to use its ports.
</P>
<P>
To better develop the Tumen River area, China has opened
Hunchun wider to the outside world, Russia opened Vladivostok, and
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has designated its Rajin
and Chongin cities as free economic and trade zones.

<HEADLINE> Contagious Disease In Tanzania Kills Cattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Food and Agricultural
Organization representative has advised Tanzania to make great
efforts to eradicate a contagious cattle disease which is
reported to have killed 17,000 heads of cattle cattle in the
country in less than two years.
</P>
<P>
FAO representative E. Patrick Alleyne gave the advice here
yesterday while opening a two-day workshop on the disease known
as Contagious Bovine Pleural Pneumonia (CBPP).
</P>
<P>
Alleyne said calculations indicated that 17,000 heads of
cattle died from CBPP between September 1994 and June 1995 valued
at about 1.5 million U.S.Dollars, apart from loss of calves and
milk.
</P>
<P>
The disease has spread from Kenya and Uganda into northern
Tanzania and eventually to the south of central railway line.
</P>
<P>
The disease could affect 90 percent of cattle population on
the invaded areas and it could kill 50 percent of the infected
cattle, Alleyne said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted a worse consequence for the already declining
meat and milk supply in the East African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
He said the FAO, in collaboration with OAU's African Bureau of
Animal Resources and the International Office for Epizootus,is
engaged in a project to evaluate the situation.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Co-operation Growing in Shanxi Coal Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April (Xinhua) -- The Shanxi Province Energy
Efficiency program, the second funded by the Overseas Development
Administration of the British Department of Trade and Industry, is
expected to start in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua learned at a ongoing seminar on clean coal technology
that the British government successfully implemented the Taiyuan
Environmental and Energy Efficiency Demonstration between 1992 and
1993.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in the two programs is two million British
Pounds.
</P>
<P>
A British delegation to the seminar is seeking wider
co-operation with this, China's main coal producer in week-long
on-the-spot studies.
</P>
<P>
This north China province was listed by the State Council as a
major energy resources and heavy chemical industrial base in the
early 1980s. The local coal industry and coal-generating power
industry are not only pillar industries for Shanxi, they also play
an important role in the country's overall economic development.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi is rich in coal resources, and consumption of raw coal
accounts for 96.19 percent of its total consumption of
non-renewable energy resources.
</P>
<P>
But backward coal-processing techniques have resulted in
serious pollution of the local environment.
</P>
<P>
The Shanxi provincial government has paid close attention to
tackling environmental pollution resulting from the coal industry,
and is seeking technological co-operation with foreign countries
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The province has put forward a group of co-operation projects
which include building a factory which will process coal for
industrial and residential use, developing new-type coke ovens,
urban utilization of coke oven gas and importing high-efficiency
combustion technology.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-Related Taxes Boost China's Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-related taxes accounted
for 10.4 percent of China's industrial and commercial taxes in
1995, emerging as a major source of China's revenues.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years foreign-related taxes have grown
between 50 percent and 85.2 percent annually, much higher than the
growth of industrial and commercial taxes.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, 120,000 foreign-funded firms had operated
in China. In the past 17 years foreign-related taxes had totalled
180 billion yuan, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Huaicheng, deputy director of the State Administration of
Taxation (SAT), urged that more efforts be made to regulate
taxation of representative offices of foreign firms, foreign
contractors and foreign citizens, who have often been found
evading taxes, and more measures should be taken to crack down on
major tax evasion cases.
</P>
<P>
SAT has also required local tax administrations to strictly
control tax exemption, reduction and rebates and establish and
upgrade systems of tax reduction, exemption, rebate and
declaration because the number of foreign-funded firms is
increasing rapidly and the preferential income tax policies for
many of these enterprises will soon expire.

<HEADLINE> Colonial Sign Removed From Entertainment Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The business sign of an
entertainment center in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province was removed because its name was linked to colonialism.
</P>
<P>
"Formosa" is a foreign name of Taiwan, which was given by
Holland colonialists in the 16th century. But China has never
claimed the name or used it.
</P>
<P>
The word was used as the business sign when the entertainment
center was set up two years ago. Local residents and a number of
members of the Political Consultative Committee of the city
immediately attacked the use of such a word.
</P>
<P>
The 1.8-meter high and 1.5 meter wide Chinese characters
derived from "Formosa" have now been removed from the wall of the
entertainment center.
</P>
<P>
A new name featuring traditional Chinese culture will be given
to the center soon.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Election manifestos of India's
parties may turn out largely to be castles in the air as none of
the contesters is expected to win a majority of the 543 elective
seats in the lower house in late April and May.
</P>
<P>
Despite their optimistic claims in public, leaders of both the
ruling Congress party and the biggest opposition Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) have reportedly admitted in private that the country
was heading for a hung parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party headed by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao
vowed a direct assault on poverty in its manifesto, with a promise
of social security measures for people living below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
With no less attention on the country's economic issues, the
BJP's manifesto outlined a bold economic agenda, including an exit
policy, placing emphasis on economic reforms rather than populist
slogans.
</P>
<P>
For the coalition of leftist parties, known as "the Third
Force," the manifestos reflect more the political diversity than a
consolidated ally.
</P>
<P>
Of the three, only the BJP has the manifesto of a majority
government, which does not necessarily mean, however, that the BJP
is confident of a majority government and Congress is not.

<TEXT>
<P>
Observers here believed that the next government's policies
would be guided by socio-political compulsions rather than any
particular manifesto.
</P>
<P>
Congress' undercurrent of new emphasis seems to be on the need
for election slogans that would not repel the Third Force parties,
who talked of similar anti-poverty measures in their manifestos.
</P>
<P>
While Congress is hoping for the Third Force to back it in
forming the central government, the BJP is under no illusion that
it will ever get the leftist support.
</P>
<P>
According to political analysts here, the BJP can only look for
support from the regional parties if it crosses the 200-seat mark,
which in itself is difficult to achieve anyway.
</P>
<P>
For Congress, winning less than even 150 seats would force it
to mobilize its support management team to court support from
other parties so as to stop the communal forces of the BJP from
coming into power.
</P>
<P>
All political parties in India have earnestly come out with
their election manifestos to woo voters with a plethora of
promises, yet surveys by psephologists forecast a grim picture of
a hung parliament.
</P>
<P>
A lukewarm response to the promises seems to be prevailing in
the country as the polling dates are drawing near.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Win 70 Games in a Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls beat
Milwaukee Bucks 86-80 in Tuesday night to set a new record of 70
wins in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls beat the lowly Milwaukee Bucks 86-80, but didn't
exactly look like the most dominating team in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
The win made Chicago 70-9, breaking the 1971-72 Los Angeles
Lakers' record of 69 wins in a single season.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls shot just 39 percent, didn't get a spectacular game
from any of their superstars and needed a scoreless final four
minutes from the Bucks to get it done.
</P>
<P>
``We didn't really play our kind of basketball,'' said Michael
Jordan, who had 22 points. ``Somehow, our defense kind of got hot
and we were able to hold them down.''
</P>
<P>
Some of the Bulls have already called themselves the greatest
team in NBA history, a boast that's sure to be debated. They'd get
a good argument from anyone using Tuesday night's performance to
judge.
</P>
<P>
It's been a season almost beyond comparison for the Bulls, a
run of success unlike any that's been seen in the NBA's 49-year
history. They won their first 37 home games, setting a mark for
most consecutive victories at the start of a season and most
spanning two seasons (44 straight).
</P>
<P>
The possibility of breaking the Lakers' 24-year-old mark became
a near certainty as the victories piled up through the
winter. With three games remaining, the Bulls can set an even
higher standard of regular-season excellence.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang Leading Trade with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- With its 3,045-kilometer border
with the Russian Federation, Heilongjiang now ranks first in the
country in trade with its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
A survey has shown that border trade between the northeastern
Chinese province and Russia amounted to 2.6 billion US dollars
last year. In 1987, it was less than 100 million US dollars. The
border trade totalled eight billion US dollars between 1987 and
1995. The figure in the first three months of this year was twice
as much as that during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zongzhang, deputy governor of the province, explained that
there are 19 Chinese and Russian cities in the border area, and
the number of category one ports in Heilongjiang has grown from
three in 1987 to 23 at present.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation between Heilongjiang and Russia is mutually
beneficial," he said, "We want raw materials and machinery from
Russia, which needs China's light industrial goods, textiles,
electric appliances, and foodstuffs." The former trading of
chemical fertilizers and steel products for garments, shoes, and
food is being replaced by trade in machinery, electrical
appliances, chemical raw materials, heavy industrial products,
automobiles, airplanes, and high-tech industrial products.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang began to pay greater attention to making its
markets in the border area more orderly by training managers in
international conventions and improving the quality of export
goods, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the volume of border trade has grown steadily, and
trade has changed from simple sub-standard methods to cash trade,
and economic and technical cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Electronics-Machinery China's Top Export Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Electronics and machinery
replaced textile goods as the largest export categories for the
first time in the history of China's external trade in 1995, the
"Economic Information Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was led by a rapid and sustained development of the
electronics and machinery industries over the past decade, the
paper stated.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that the export value of electronic and
machinery products in 1995 posted a 37.1 percent rise at 43.9
billion US dollars-worth. They made up 29.5 percent of the
country's total trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 percent of the exports were advanced machinery and
instruments with high added value while the export of metal
products which require much labor and raw materials shrank to 11.9
percent, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to traditional markets, China has edged its way
into Africa, South America and member countries of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations with electronics and machinery
products.

<HEADLINE> Mobile Phone Prices in China Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China has brought the cost of
using a mobile phone down to an affordable level, to deal with the
country's low telephone density.
</P>
<P>
The cellular phone will no longer be a symbol of the new rich,
but a matter of necessity for the growing white-collar population,
according to the "East China Information Daily".
</P>
<P>
The price-cutting was first triggered by a move by Unicom
Corp. to challenge the monopoly of the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications in Shanghai, which cut the subscription fee to
2,500 yuan, and per-minute charge fell to 0.2 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Following suit, the ministry lowered subscription rates to a
similar level, and reduced the retail price of a phone by 1,400
yuan.
</P>
<P>
In Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, the price war
between Unicom and the ministry brought the price of a digital
cellular phone down to 10,000 yuan, from 21,000 yuan a year ago.
</P>
<P>
When the price of a cellular phone fell to 10,000 yuan, no
higher than that of a Japanese color television, it triggered
panic buying among white-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the price-cutting will continue. A rule in
the electronics industry is that every doubling of output brings
about a 30-percent drop in the price. Mobile phones are no
exception. The price is expected to be as low as 100 US dollars by
the end of the century, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
China has 3.3 million to 3.5 million cellular phone users, and
will set up a country-wide digital mobile telecommunications
network by the end of the century. A big surge of mobile phone
buying will occur in the not-too-distant future, according to the
paper.

MANAGUA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua had booked berths in
five events at this summer's Atlanta Olympic Games, Nicaragua's
Sports and Youth Association announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua, with a tiny population of only four million, has
pinned its Olympic medal hope in baseball, the most frenzied
sports of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan baseball squad, the runner-up of the Pan
American Games in Mar del Plata, Argentina in March, 1995, showed
its superiority again by winning the first Pan Pacific Games in
Colombia last June.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua also finished third in the continental baseball
tourney in Cuba last October.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Orlando Vasquez, the country's top weightlifter,
will vie for the title in the men's 54-kg category competitions in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Walter Soza will compete in Atlanta swimming pool, in the men's
200-meter freestyle and 200-meter individual medley.
</P>
<P>
The other two events in which Nicaragua had gained Olympic
tickets were shooting and judo.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Province in east China
plans to spend about four years demarcating its peripheral and
interior borders for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Throughout Chinese history, there was little record on the
demarcation of borders between provinces, cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has joint land borders stretching more than 1,470 km
with Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, and the
municipality of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Inside Zhejiang over 10,000 borders between cities, counties
and prefectures wait to be delimited. Most of the lines just
follow conventional demarcations.
</P>
<P>
The demarcation of border lines will boost administrative
management and help maintain social stability and economic growth,
according to Liu Xirong, vice-governor of Zhejiang.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Non-Governmental Exchanges with Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- While the situation in Africa has
become more relaxed over recent years, contacts and exchanges
between the non-governmental friendship organizations of China and
African nations have been growing.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, non-governmental exchanges in economy, culture
and other fields between China and Africa have also been
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Chinese People's Association
for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC), Sino-African
non-governmental contacts have helped consolidate the traditional
friendship between China and Africa on the one hand, and opened up
new links to promote official diplomatic ties on the other.
</P>
<P>
In the past few decades China has established bilateral
friendship associations with many African nations and maintained
friendly exchanges with those countries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the CPAFFC alone has received 37 delegations
from North Africa, over 40 from French-speaking African countries
and several dozen from the English-speaking nations.
</P>
<P>
Last September, when President Ahmed El-Bashir of the Sudan
visited China the China-Sudan Friendship Association was
established in Beijing. The president attended the founding
ceremony of the association.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-African friendship organizations have hosted various
types of activities to mark the independence days of African
countries and anniversaries of establishment of diplomatic
relations between China and African nations.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the CPAFFC sent a group of martial arts experts and
conjurers to Namibia when the country celebrated its fifth
independence anniversary. The group also went to Zimbabwe to join
the celebrations marking that country's 15th independence day.
</P>
<P>
During the tour Namibian President Sam Nujoma watched the show
and senior officials of Zimbabwe met with the performers to
congratulate them on their successful visit.
</P>
<P>
To have non-governmental contacts with countries which have no
diplomatic ties with China is one of the major characteristics of
Sino-African exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, some local government and press
delegations from South Africa and Malawi have visited China,
gaining more knowledge about this country. Such visits have
widened the channels of exchanges between these countries and
China.
</P>
<P>
After many years of promotion, Chinese provinces or cities have
set up sistership ties in every corner of the African
continent. Last November, Shanghai and Windhoek in Namibia became
sister cities, and earlier this year China's Shanxi Province and
The Midlands of Zimbabwe became sister provinces.
</P>
<P>
The economic and cultural exchanges and co-operation between
these sister cities and provinces have enhanced the friendship
between China and African nations, and helped promote the growth
of state-to-state relations as well.
</P>
<P>
The CPAFFC official said such non-governmental exchanges with
African countries will be further strengthened this year.
</P>
<P>
The CPAFFC plans to send delegations to Cameroon, Guinea, Togo
and Mauritius this year. Meanwhile, exchanges with countries like
South Africa and Malawi will continue in order to promote the
development of official ties.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of youth in China's
capital city have proved that they have hearts of gold.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has established a thriving youth volunteer team to
provide loving-heart services for those in need of help.
</P>
<P>
The team, composed of over 1,000 young people aged between 16
and 18, have launched their volunteer service for the old, the
poor, and for sick patients during their so-called probationary
period leading to their adulthoods.
</P>
<P>
They will serve other people in six major parks in Beijing each
weekend, help set up 18 loving-heart bases in all local counties
and districts, and organize 100 pairs of one-to-one groups, and
offer free services in 163 local old folks' homes.
</P>
<P>
The young people will each carry a volunteer card and one
volunteer service manual at hand, and when they serve the
designated people, those helped are asked to sign the card.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of a national drive, sponsored by the Chinese
Communist Youth League's Central Committee, to help youth serve
society.

<HEADLINE> Outstanding Rural Firms Given Triple A Credit Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 non-state-run
enterprises in east China's Jiangsu Province have been given the
Triple A credit rating, the highest of the three credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
The 1,331 companies were chosen from 11,000 non-state-run ones,
most of them run by villages or townships.
</P>
<P>
The number of those receiving the rating was a third greater
than last year, indicating that the quality of rural industry in
Jiangsu has improved a great deal, said a provincial government
official.
</P>
<P>
On average, these enterprises' business increased by 42.6
percent to 121 million yuan last year, with profits up by 21.2
percent at 7.3 million yuan, and total volume of assets by 54.9
percent, at 50.6 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province's village and township enterprises are a growing
force in Jiangsu's economic development, having generated 500
billion yuan in revenues in 1995, up 30 percent from 1994. This
accounted for two-thirds of the provincial industrial output.
</P>
<P>
The industrial enterprises in rural areas saw their total
industrial output value and pre-tax profits increase by 30
percent.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Expanding Cooperation with Neighboring Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Economic, cultural, and scientific
cooperation between the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and
neighboring Central Asian countries has been growing since the
1990s, when China began to open its border areas wider.
</P>
<P>
The multi-ethnic region has become a pioneer in cooperating
with neighboring countries. A survey has shown that imports and
exports between Xinjiang and Central Asian countries rose from
tens of million US dollars' worth in the late 1980s to more than
100 million in 1992, and 695 million last year.
</P>
<P>
This accounted for about a half of the region's foreign trade,
while the variety of goods increased from daily necessities to
machinery, electrical appliances, chemicals, chemical fertilizers,
and steel products.
</P>
<P>
A local official says that the traditional barter trade is
being replaced with cash trade.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is cooperating with Russia in education and technical
exchanges in more than 20 fields, including metallurgy, geology,
petro-chemicals, micro-electronics, and new energy.
</P>
<P>
It has successfully cooperated with Kazakhstan in prospecting,
in holding science and technology exhibitions, and in arranging
training courses on the cultivation of higher quality wheat.
</P>
<P>
The region has sent equestrians to be trained in Kirghizia and
has invited instructors from Kazakhstan to help train skaters and
other athletes.

``I've been working hard,'' Ivankov, the 1994 all-around world

<HEADLINE> India Reluctant to Lower Import Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- India is likely to seek a
reprieve from further lowering tariff and non-tariff barriers on
the imports of consumer goods at the next round of talks with the
World Trade Organization (WTO) to be held later this year, an
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
India would not lower quantitative curbs as per WTO guidelines
until a considerable improvement is achieved in its foreign
exchange position. As part of its commitment to WTO, the Indian
government has already put some consumer and electronic goods on
open import license list in the revised export import policy, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO, along with the US and some European countries have
been pressuring India to open up its markets.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry is against the removal of restrictions on
consumer goods import as this could jeopardize attempts to attract
large-scale foreign direct investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
If such curbs are lifted, the foreign manufacturers might
prefer to export the products from their overseas plants by taking
advantage of lower interest rates and input costs, the official
added.

NEW DELHI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- India's Commerce Ministry has
initiated changes in its diamond import and export norms allowing
trade in rough diamonds, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
India is now mainly an importer of roughs and exporter of cut
and polished diamond stones. It is the first time that India
allows Indian companies to import, stock, export and sell rough
diamonds locally against a license.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the government's decision to permit trade in
rough diamonds is to capture part of 6-7 billion US dollar global
diamond trade, over 50 percent of which is handled by Antwerp,
Holland. The other major rough diamond trading center is in
London, exporters here said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Investors Confident of Investing in Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Taiwan business executives are
full of confidence in investing in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Xu Junda, chairman of the Fuzhou-based Hechong Group, and Li
Xizheng, general manager of the Fuzhou-based Antong Group, agreed
that over the past few years the mainland has improved its
investment environment and has enjoyed social stability.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Taiwan investors' legitimate rights and
interests have been well protected, and that their businesses in
the mainland have been expanding production steadily.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989 Xu has built three textile companies in the Fujian
provincial capital of Fuzhou, and is building the Chengzhan
Knitwear Industry Company in Fuzhou at a total cost of 30 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new company is scheduled to go into operation later this
year, he said, adding that it will supply products to cotton yarn
mills operated by Taiwan business people in the mainland, as well
as to mills in Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
"I think economic exchanges across the Taiwan Straits are
conducive to both the mainland and Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Personal safety and property of Taiwan investors are more
secure in the mainland than in other parts of the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Li Xizheng said, "I have a better understanding of mainland's
policies than some shareholders in Taiwan. Recently some
shareholders in Taiwan were worried about investing in the
mainland. I told them that there are no risks at all. Our
production, livelihood and recreation here have been going on as
usual."
</P>
<P>
His Antong Group has invested 80 million US dollars in the
mainland, and will have invested another 40 million dollars by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The group plans to build 100 supermarkets in Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
"I think Fuzhou city leaders have given top priority to
Taiwan-funded companies and are doing their utmost to protect our
rights and interests," he said.

XI'AN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Water-shortage Shaanxi Province is
to invest one billion yuan in the next three years to build a
"Sweet Dew Project", to provide clean drinking water to people and
animals in its arid areas.
</P>
<P>
As the province receives little rainfall, 4.1 million people in
the four mountainous areas are suffering from water shortages,
which have retarded economic growth there.
</P>
<P>
The "Sweet Dew Project", jointly organized by the provincial
planning commission, water resources and financial departments and
the anti-poverty office, aims to improve living and production
conditions, and help local people to step out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, the provincial government will assist the
four mountainous areas to build water cells, wells and pumping
stations. Dry land cultivation technology will be spread to a
large extent.
</P>
<P>
Government funds allocated for the project in 1996 will be 90
million yuan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tried to Block Hand-over of Canal to Panama: Noriega </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. presidents Ronald
Reagan and George Bush tried to halt the hand-over of the Panama
Canal to the Panamanian government, Panama's former military
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega alleged on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview in the United States, where he is
currently imprisoned, the former general claimed that the Bush and
Reagan administrations had planned not to hand over the canal and
to keep U.S. military bases in the canal zone beyond the year
2000, in contravention of the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties.
</P>
<P>
However, the administration of President Bill Clinton has
respected the treaties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaties, the U.S. government would turn over the
81-kilometer canal to Panama and withdraw all its forces from the
country by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The United States has administered the canal, which shortens
the original sea route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by
over 10,000 kilometers, since 1914. More than 10,000 U.S. troops
are now stationed in 10 military bases in the canal zone.
</P>
<P>
Noriega was ousted in December 1989 when 27,000 U.S. troops
invaded Panama. He was taken to the United States where he was
tried in Miami and sentenced to 40 years of imprisonment on
charges of drug trafficking and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, which was reported in the press here, Noriega
also confirmed that he had collaborated with the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency and complained that his trial was full of
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
He alleged that his defence counsel was not informed of a deal
between Colombia's Cali drug cartel and prosecutors to provide
evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled that Bush had requested in televised
statements that he be sentenced immediately.

<HEADLINE> Mobile Clinic Benefits Chinese Cataract Sufferers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Some farmers in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province have had their sight restored, thanks to eye
operations done in the first mobile clinic in China, a donation of
a Hong Kong association for the blind and an Asian foundation for
the prevention of blindness.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the Hong Kong business people, I can see everything
clearly now," said Peng Hengjing, a man in his seventies, who was
overjoyed at having recovered his lost eyesight. Peng was one of
75 common folk in the province helped by the clinic.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are more than 100,000 cataract
sufferers in the province, and only 30 percent who have had eye
operations.
</P>
<P>
The patients may have a greater possibility of recovering their
lost eyesight in future if a mobile clinic can be sent near them,
in the view of Chenliang Yueming, general secretary of the
foundation and the association.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, she began collecting donations for her dream, which
came true when she was given three million HK dollars from He
Yingjie, a businessman with the Hong Kong Tobacco Company.
</P>
<P>
The 12-m-long, 2.5-m wide clinic, which weighs 14.8 tons, was
put together in Hong Kong last year. It has an examination room,
an operation room, and even a lobby, as well as its own power
generator, water supply, air conditioning, and light system. It is
equipped with a lift to move patients after they have had an
operation.
</P>
<P>
The clinic was presented to China last December. During a
43-day probation period, 284 people in Shaanxi Province and South
China's Guangdong Province had operations in it. There were no
problems with the operations and no bad results.
</P>
<P>
The good thing is that the operations only cost patients half
what they would pay for similar treatment in a hospital, and
poorer patients can be given free treatment.
</P>
<P>
The province has also set up a medical group, which plans to
conduct 1,500 to 2,000 artificial lens implant operations, using
two million yuan (about 241,000 US dollars) in funds.

HAIKOU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Money from all corners of the

southernmost China's Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years the city has actually used nearly

Foreign-funded enterprises are doing business in the fields

<HEADLINE> EBRD Renews Support for Reform in Central, Eastern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- An annual meeting of the European
Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) ended here today
with renewed commitment to support reform in the central and east
European countries.
</P>
<P>
"The EBRD now has the essential resources to meet the growing
demand for investment and to assist the deepening of the reform
process in central and east European countries," EBRD President
Jacques de Larosiere told the closing session of the two-day
meeting.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, member countries and institutions of the EBRD
unanimously agreed to increase the bank's capital from 10 billion
ECU (13 billion U.S. dollars) to 20 billion ECU (26 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Larosiere said the EBRD in the future will invest more in the
financial sector in central and eastern Europe; expand cooperation
with medium and small enterprises; give more support to the
post-privatization funds in the region and strengthen research on
environmental projects.
</P>

The president added that there are three principles for the
EBRD to choose projects in the future: wise bank policy,
supportive fund raising and accelerating transition.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the EBRD decided to accept Bosnia-Herzegovina
as its 60th member. But the bank made no decision on the sum of
investment in the republic badly in need of aid for reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD's next annual meeting will be held in London in April

<HEADLINE> Former Bangladesh Ruling Party Demands Earlier Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The former ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has demanded for holding the next
parliamentary elections by May while questioning the neutrality of
the present caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
The BNP chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia, addressing a huge rally
here Tuesday, said that "I call upon the chief adviser (to the
caretaker government) to arrange the elections by May and chief
election commissioner to announce the election schedule
immediately."
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the caretaker government
preferred to hold the general elections in mid-June, which was
supported by former mainstream opposition parties -- mainly the
Awami (people's) League (AL), the Jatiya (national) Party (JP) and
the Jammat-e-Islami.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda, who was also ex-prime minister, also expressed her
dissatisfaction over delay in announcing the date of the polls,
saying the former opposition parties "first wanted the polls in
May."
</P>
<P>
"We told the president that the BNP was ready for polls in
May," said Khaleda, who resigned from the post of the prime
minister on March 30 along with the dissolution of the 12-day 6th
parliament elected by the BNP on February 15 despite all
opposition parties' boycott.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fact that some BNP activists were arrested
and false cases were lodged against them recently, the BNP Chief
said:
</P>
<P>
"This is not called neutrality. A neutral government must take
action against all terrorists and illegal arms possessors
irrespective of their party affiliation."
</P>
<P>
She also warned that if the caretaker government failed to act
impartially her party will withdraw its cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's rally, thousands of party activists and people
gathered here to shout their demands.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda has addressed four BNP rallies so far since she quit
power more than two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Refuse to Arrest Karadzic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Serb political and military
leaders wanted for war crimes will never be sacrificed for the
sake of economic aid, a senior Bosnian Serb vowed today.
</P>
<P>
Radovan Karadic, self-styled president of the Bosnian Serb
Republic and Ratko Mladic, the Serb military leader, have both
been indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal in the
Hague for crimes carried out during the four-year war in the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But in a radio interview, Bosnian Serb parliamentary speaker
Momcilo Krajisnik rejected the West's demand for the arrest of the
two leaders and their handover to the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik told Radio Obrenovac of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia that both men were innocent and accused the West of
trying to force them to stand down using the carrot of financial
aid.
</P>
<P>
He accused the international community of conditioning the
Serbs participation in last weekend's Donors Conference in
Brussels to raise money for reconstruction with the arrest and
handover of Karadzic and Mladic.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serbs boycotted the conference due to the organizers'
refusal to allow them separate representation. The Serbs rejected
a request to attend as part of a joint delegation with the
Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik accused the West of discriminating against Bosnian
Serbs by demanding a joint team because, under the Dayton peace
agreement, there is no central government in Bosnia until the
general elections scheduled for September.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Employees of Ecuador's supreme and
provincial electoral courts started an indefinite strike today
despite the looming general elections.
</P>
<P>
The strike, aimed to push the Finance Ministry for a salary
increase, took place only three days from the scheduled April 19
elections at various levels of the country.
</P>
<P>
Patricio Sampertegui, president of the Association of Supreme
Electoral Court Employees, said 3 billion sucres, or about 1
million U.S. dollars, would be needed to increase the salaries of
the personnel of all the provincial electoral bodies this year.
</P>
<P>
This amount, he said, was approved last year by the National
Congress Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Minister Ivan Andrade said his ministry could
not pay out the fund because it doesn't have the money in the
fiscal treasury.
</P>
<P>
The government proposes an increase of 35 percent salaries
while the demands of the strikers range up to 150 percent, he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Industry Takes Favorable Turn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's industrial production
has taken a turn for the better, growing by more than five percent
in 1995, Hungarian Minister of Industry and Commerce Danoi Imre
said today.
</P>
<P>
This growth rate is expected to be sustained in the next few
years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's industrial sector had been declining since 1990, with
industrial output in 1993 accounting for only half that in 1989.
</P>
<P>
But in 1995, industrial productivity rose by 12 percent and
industrial exports by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The machinery industry staged the most dramatic recovery, with
output increasing 20 percent and exports 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the upturn to foreign investment and
the privatization drive in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that private enterprise, which accounted for more
than 60 percent of total industrial output in 1995, plays an
crucial role in Hungarian industry.
</P>
<P>
But he also pointed out that uneven development is still the
main problem hindering Hungary's industrial growth.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Urges Donors to Honour Aid Pledges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's central bank governor on
Tuesday urged international donors to honour their pledges of
financial aid for the country's reconstruction efforts, reports
reaching Zagreb say.
</P>
<P>
"Judging by words and promises, the international community
seems to like us, but we expect deeds," said governor Kasim
Omicevic.
</P>
<P>
"Only then we will see how much they like," he said.
</P>
<P>
At a Donors Conference in Brussels last weekend, more than 50
nations pledged a total of 1.23 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 to
help the re-building of war-torn Bosnia. The meeting was called
after last December's Donors Conference only managed to raise 600
million dollars of the 1.8 billion dollars needed for urgent
reconstruction work in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Omicevic, who was in the Bulgarian capital Sofia for the
annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, said providing jobs for the millions of Bosnians
displaced by the war was the government's top priority.
</P>
<P>
"We have to find new jobs for our people," he told delegates.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Bosnia has to go through two
transitions: one from a planned economy to a market economy with a
dominant private sector and the other from a war-time economy to a
peace-time economy.

<HEADLINE> Spain Bans Imports of Egyptian Potatoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Spain, following the footsteps of
other European countries, announced today a ban on imports of
potatoes from Egypt where a fast-spreading virus has infected the
crop.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the virus has infected not only Egyptian
potatoes and other root vegetables, but also crops which are
planted among or alongside them, such as garlic and carrots,
Ministry of Agriculture officials said.
</P>
<P>
Vegetable farms attacked by the virus have to be closed for at
least five years before resuming production, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has a preferential deal with the Europe Union (EU) to
supply 110,000 tons of potatoes, which threatens to spread the
disease across Europe.
</P>
<P>
So far the virus has been discovered but controlled in some
European countries, including the Netherlands and Spain, which
have virtually banned imports of Egyptian potatoes since early
April.
</P>
<P>
France and Finland, alarmed by the spread of the virus, last
week decided to close their borders to Egyptian potatoes.
</P>
<P>
EU institutions in charge of plant quarantine are now
considering whether to impose a partial or total ban on potato
imports from Egypt.

At a press conference in Pretoria, Manuel said: "Panic
decisions on exchange controls will not work. It is imperative
that we keep a cool head at times like these," he said.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said the government would remain committed to the
gradual lifting of foreign exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
Rand, which had been weak for quite a long time, yesterday hit
a new record low of 4.2200 against the dollar in the financial
market.
</P>
<P>
However, Manuel said the volatility of the Rand should be seen
in broad perspective.
</P>
<P>
There had been significantly shifts in the global economic
environment, with the U.S. Dollar stronger than it had been in a
long time. The U.S. interest rates were also rising.
</P>
<P>
The market was responding these factors, said the minister,
adding it was to all of those circumstances that the Rand was
reacting.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Manuel said the government's response had to be
in terms of the total configuration, relaxing exchange controls
would be done through careful monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the minister said he believed the Rand was still
marginally undervalued against the U.S. Dollar, and predicted it
would strengthen at some point.
</P>
<P>
"The currency will find its level in a response to two things:
its purchasing power parity and an evaluation of confidence by the
market," said Manuel.

LAGOS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The US Information Service (USIS)
in Lagos today denied a newspaper report that the US government
had rejected the nomination of Alhaji Hasan Adamu as Nigeria's
new ambassador to Washington.
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the local newspaper
"This Day" reported in its April 13 edition that the American had
rejected Alhaji Hassan's nomination.
</P>
<P>
Local press earlier this month reported that the Nigerian
Foreign Ministry had confirmed that Alhaji Adamu had been

</P>
<P>
But the USIS said in a statement that the Nigerian government
had not submitted a nomination to the US government as
replacement for Ambassador Zubair Kazaur.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Zubair was brought back home by the Nigerian government
last November in Retaliation for the recall of the US Ambassador

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
said today that it was alarmed at the recent escalation of conflict
in the Middle East, urging all parties for self-restriction.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to both sides to respond positively to the
international mediatory efforts to get the peace process back on
track," said Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the radical Moslem resistance group
Hezbollah attacks against Israel and intensified revenge attacks
by the Israeli troops on villages in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said the South African government does not agree with the
policy of collective responsibility and punishment that seems to
form the basis for attacks between Israel and Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Innocent civilians in Israel and Lebanon suffer because of
the "indiscriminate attacks and reprisals", he added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister said South Africa is strongly
opposed to violence of this nature, saying that the escalation of
violence would play into the hands of those forces seeking to
disrupt the peace process in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Georgia, China Agree to Enhance Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TBILISI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China and Georgia agreed today to
strengthen bilateral cooperation in all fields, particularly in
economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during the talks held here between
Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Georgian
Foreign Minister Irakly Menagarishvili.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here today for a one-day visit, said economic
and trade cooperation is a major base of bilateral relations and
there is potential in this respect.
</P>
<P>
He said China is ready to work with Georgia for more ways and
means of cooperation and both countries should encourage their
enterprises to boost their business relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian also said China values its relations with Georgia,
respects Georgia's sovereignty and independence, supports it in
safeguarding territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Georgia has tried to reconquer its western separatist Abkhazia
region, where a self-styled republic was proclaimed in April 1992.
</P>
<P>
Qian said both countries have witnessed the smooth development
of bilateral relations since diplomatic ties were established in
June 1992. Georgia declared independence amid the breakup of the
Soviet Union in late 1991.
</P>
<P>
There are no conflicts of interests between the two countries
and both countries share similar or identical views on many major
international issues, he added.
</P>
<P>
Menagarishvili said Georgia is gratified at and proud of having
such a loyal friend as China. Georgia highly values China's role
in international affairs and appreciates China's foreign policies
of treating all countries equally in the world, big or small, and
non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Georgia's commitment to its "one China" policy
and believed Qian's visit ushers in a new dawn in bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> Major New Gas Field Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The discovery of China's second
largest offshore natural-gas field, Dongfang 1-1, was announced
yesterday by the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC),
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Gong Zaisheng, CNOOC's chief geologist, said Dongfang 1-1,
second only to Ya 13-1 that now provides three billion cubic
metres of gas to Hong Kong, could contain more than 100 billion
cubic meters of gas.
</P>
<P>
The supply could ensure reserves for the country's planned
large chemical fertilizer plant in Hainan province.
</P>
<P>
With confirmed reserves of 80 billion cubic metres, the gas
field located in the western part of the South China Sea could
ensure a stable supply for at least 20 years to help the Hainan
fertilizer plant annually produce 2.5 million tons of urea and 1.5
million tons of synthetic ammonia. The plant is to be built
pending government approval. Such an output would be one-tenth of
China's total.
</P>
<P>
In areas southeast of Dongfang, CNOOC has discovered
medium-sized and small gas fields. In Ledong 22-1, reserves are
estimated at 20 billion cubic meters; and in Ledong 15-1, 18
billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Total resources in this area, called Ledong, and another area
called Lingtou, would be 100 billion cubic meters, Gong said.
</P>
<P>
In the Bohai Sea, CNOOC discovered a major oil field,
Qinhuangdao 32-6, where reserves are estimated at 200 million
tons. The number of oil fields that each contain 200 million tons
or more now totals three. The other two are Suizhong, also in
Bohai, and Liuhua in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil in Qinhuangdao 32-6, in a structure covering 67
square kilometers, is buried in concentrated reservoirs and is of
good quality, Gong said.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging results have also been seen in exploration in the
western part of the South China Sea, where some 20 million tons of
crude oil have been verified in Weizhou 12-1 oilfield.
</P>
<P>
With this discovery, development of several medium-size and
small oilfields around Weizhou 12-1 are possible, as costs can be
cut.
</P>
<P>
In seas where water depth is hundreds of meters, a production
system would cost 300 million U.S. dollars. Only when output will
exceed input should an oilfield be developed.
</P>
<P>
With these discoveries, CNOOC is confident that annual
production will be kept above 10 million tons of oil and 8 billion
cubic meters of gas by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, additional reserves should be confirmed to ensure that
output does not decline after 2000, CNOOC executives said.

<HEADLINE> Poverty in Latin America, Caribbean Worse Than in 1980s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Poverty levels in Latin American
and Caribbean countries are now higher than they were in the
1980s, and economic growth needs to rise by two thirds if the
situation is to improve, a U.N. report has warned.
</P>
<P>
Annual growth needs to increase to some six percent from the
average 3.6 percent achieved in the early 1990s to make any real
progress in reducing poverty and unemployment, the report says.
</P>
<P>
But the average investment of 28 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) that such a target will require is "not yet within
our reach," the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean (CEPAL) told the region's governments at a session of
the commission.
</P>
<P>
Regional economic growth over the last few years has not been
enough to lead to significant reductions in poverty or
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The level of GDP per capita in 1995 was higher than that of
1980 in only nine of the region's 30 countries and only Chile,
Colombia, Uruguay, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic witnessed an
increase of more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Growth in most economic sectors of the region during the past
five years has been "respectable," but well below past performance
and inadequate from social and technical perspectives, the report
said.

MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia said today that more
efforts must be made to ease the mounting tensions on the Korean
peninsula, the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman as
saying that Russia could play a more positive role in stabilizing
the situation on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Russia agreed that the armistice agreement
signed by South Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

out-of-date.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the armistice should not be abandoned until a
new peace accord is reached between all parties involved.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Russia noticed the peace proposal put
forward by U.S. President Bill Clinton and his South Korean
counterpart, Kim Young-sam, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, South Korea and the U.S. called on the DPRK
and China to join a four-way talks aimed at a permanent peace on

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Accuser Goes Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- LaDonna August, the woman who
filed a sexual battery complaint against world heavyweight
champion Mike Tyson last week, went public with her charges at a
press conference in Gary, Indiana on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
August, a 25-year-old beautician who had been unidentified
until Tuesday, sat surrounded by bodyguards as her lawyers
described her version of events at the Clique nightclub in
Chicago on April 7.
</P>
<P>
"It was a confrontation between my client and Mr. Tyson," said
Charles Graddick, one of the four lawyers who accompanied August
to the news conference. "According to her, some inappropriate
comments and statements were made, followed immediately by
inappropriate touching, fondling, which included a suckling if
you will on the left side of the face."
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who was convicted in 1992 of raping a beauty pageant
contestant in Indianapolis the previous year, has remained at his
home on Southfield, Ohio, while the investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
He served three years of a six-year sentence in an Indiana
prison, and is still on probation.
</P>
<P>
No formal charges have been made against Tyson, who has made no
comment on the case. Chicago police said the fighter had made
himself available for questioning.
</P>
<P>
According to his co-manager John Horne, Tyson believes he did
nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
Graddick said August was told she could get her coat when she
was lured into a private room of the nightclub where the incident
took place.
</P>
<P>
He said that August rode with friends the 30 miles (48km) from
Chicago to Gary before going to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
Horne has said August tried for much of the evening to meet
Tyson, and when she did so it was in the presence of Chicago
police.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Tyson was convicted of raping Desiree Washington, an
18-year-old contestant in the Miss Black America beauty pageant
the previous year at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
He was released from jail in March of 1995, and on March 16 of
this year the former undisputed world champion recaptured the
World boxing Council heavyweight title with a third-round
knockout of Briton Frank Bruno.

<HEADLINE> Official Throws Spotlight On Rural Medical Care System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Peng Peiyun has
called for efforts to be made to improve the cooperative medical
system in rural areas to facilitate the establishment of a market
economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Inspecting east China's Jiangsu Province, Peng said, "Rural
residents constitute the overwhelming majority of China's
population. Medical care for all is a basic requirement posed by
farmers."
</P>
<P>
She said that doing a job of medical care in rural areas is
vital to the implementation of the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan
that starts this year, and the attainment of the long-range
objective for the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
According to Peng, a medical care and disease-prevention
network at village, township and county levels, with rural doctors
and the rural medical care insurance system, serve as "three
pillars" for rural public health work.
</P>
<P>
"I think we should explore different forms of cooperative
medical care systems suited to different areas," she told local
officials.
</P>
<P>
She praised Jiangsu Province for improving the rural
cooperative medical care system over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The system has been introduced in 64 percent of all villages in
Jiangsu, one of the most developed areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun noted that to make the system a success, both
collectives and individuals must share the financial burden.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in Jiangsu, Peng visited clinics and hospitals
in Jiangyin, Zhangjiagang and Wuxian.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Choose Taxis As the Way to Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's rickshaws were once the
way to travel. Now tourists see the sights from the comfort of
pedal-power pedicabs.
</P>
<P>
But for the Chinese hailing a taxi has become the thing to do
as a growing fleet of cabs take to city streets.
</P>
<P>
A conference here Tuesday was told that each Chinese person
takes an average 4.5 cab journeys a year -- hailing one of the
half a million taxis plying for hire in cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Some one million cab drivers work in more than 600 cities
across the country.
</P>
<P>
China's fleet of 500,000 cabs is more than seven times the
number licensed just a decade ago. The cabs make a staggering 5.5
billion passenger journeys every year.
</P>
<P>
The details were released at a national meeting on urban cab
driving in Zhengzhou, capital city of central China's Henan
province.
</P>
<P>
Cab driving is a relatively new industry in China, coming into
service a decade ago. The number of cab driving companies has
increased to nearly 10,000.
</P>
<P>
The taxi trade annually turns in six billion yuan
(about 723 million U.S. dollars) in taxes and profits in total.
</P>
<P>
The taxi trade is considered to have helped alleviate
public transportation shortages in Chinese cities, as well as
providing more job opportunities and making more profits.
</P>
<P>
Beijing tops the list for the city with most cabs -- having
60,000 cabs, Shanghai, the second, has 36,000, and Tianjin is
third with 26,000.
</P>
<P>
Beijing also has 4,400 buses which transport 8.5 million
passengers every day.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Heads Field for Queens Club Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras will defend his
Queens Club grass-court title in June, facing a tough challenge of
three-time titlist Boris Becker and clay-court specialist Thomas
Muster, according to the organizers here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 700,000-U.S.-Dollar tournament is one of the biggest
pre-Wimbledon grass-court events and takes place June 10-16, two
weeks before the Grand Slam championship at the All-England Club.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Michael Stich and Sweden's Stefan Edberg, two more
players who have won at Queens and Wimbledon, also are in the
56-player draw, as well as the lefthander Goran Ivanisevic of
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Muster, who has just lost the world No. 1 ranking to Sampras
and defends his French Open title next month, has had virtually no
success on grass and finds the surface alien to his back-court
game.

Tuesday and will miss the rest of the Dutch domestic soccer
season, according to the club on Tuesday.

He will reportedly be sidelined for up to six weeks recovering
from the cartilage injury which he sustained over the weekend.

ROME, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf, returning after an
eight-year absence, will top the strongest ever women's field at
the Italian Open which begins on May 6, according to the
organizers here on Tuesday.

Graf, who now holds a joint number one ranking with Seles, will
clash alongside with Conchita Martinez, Arantxa Scanchez Vicario,
Gabriela Sabatini and Anke Huber.

of the more recent teen-age sensations, Martina Hingis, is already
committed.

in the men's edition of the clay court classic that opens at the
Foro Italico a week later.

<HEADLINE> Bordeaux Beats Slavia to Gain Finals of UEFA Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Didier Tholot scored a goal a
minute into the second half to pace host Bordeaux to a 1-0 victory
over Slavia of Prague in the the second leg of the UEFA Cup
semifinals Tuesday that put the French team in the finals May 1
and 15.
</P>
<P>
Bordeaux would have the return match at home on May 15.
</P>
<P>
Bordeaux won the first leg 1-0 in the Czech Republic two weeks
ago on an early goal by Christophe Dugarry.
</P>
<P>
Tholot scored just after the teams came back after intermission.
 He almost got another when he was called for offside on a free
kick and Zidane had a goal that was disallowed just minutes before
the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
Both teams scored huge upsets in the quarterfinals, when
Bordeaux eliminated Italian powerhouse AC Milan with a 3-0 victory
at home and Slavia got past AC Roma with a last-minute overtime
winner in Rome.
</P>
<P>
France has two more chances in European Cups over the next two
days. Nantes faces Juventus of Turin in the Champions League
semifinal Wednesday and Paris-St. Germain takes on La Corona
Deportivo Thursday in the Cupwinners semifinal, its fourth
European Cup semifinal in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
Previously France has had just six finalists in European
competitions and only one winner _ Marseille in the Champions Cup
in 1993. But the glory of that victory was taken off in the
aftermath of the bribing scandal in the French league.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Hispanic media in the
United States announced today a voter registration campaign to
sign up at least a million new voters in time for the November
elections.
</P>
<P>
The bilingual campaign is being headed by the Washington-based
National Association of Hispanic Publications (NAHP), and New
York-based Univision, the country's largest Spanish-language
television network.
</P>
<P>
"Hispanics have been significantly alarmed over anti-Hispanic
efforts that have overtaken this country," said Andres Tobar,
executive director of the association representing 150 Hispanic
newspapers and magazines nationwide, with a readership of more
than five million.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that this is unfair. We feel that the only way that
we can respond effectively is through registering to vote," Tobar
said.
</P>
<P>
Hispanics make up 11 percent of the U.S. population, or 27
million.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 million Latino adults in the United States are
citizens of the country, and about 6 million of them are
registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, about 4.2 million Hispanics voted, according to NAHP.
</P>
<P>
Some Hispanic professional and advocacy groups have already
launched their own voter drives.

<HEADLINE> More New Zealanders Waiting for Surgeries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Waiting lists in New Zealand
hospitals have increased 50 percent since the Government
restructured the health system in 1993.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by the opposition Labor Party last night.
</P>
<P>
Labor health spokeswoman Lianne Dalziel said the figures,
obtained from crown health enterprises, show 93,930 people are on
surgical waiting lists, up from 62,000 in 1993, when the
restructuring began with an eye to raising the efficiency of the
public hospitals.
</P>
<P>
She said the Government should start a blitz on the lists to
ensure that all people, regardless of financial means, have access
to decent health care.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing increases in acute admissions to hospital
because people can't afford primary health care," she said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jim Bolger has indicated the Government will
pump more money into the health system to stop hospitals delaying
non-urgent surgery because of funding problems.

<HEADLINE> Stocks on Wall Street Edge Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks moved higher
today, boosted by technology issues after a strong earnings report
by Intel, the world's biggest chip maker, eased worries about
sluggishness in the industry.
</P>
<P>
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose to a record
close, gaining 12.60 to 1,123.04, on the surprisingly strong
earnings report by Intel.
</P>
<P>
Intel reported Monday evening that it earned 894 million U.S.
dollars, or 1.02 U.S. dollars per share, in the first quarter,
higher than analyst forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.10 to 5,620.02.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 9 to 7, with
1,331 up, 1,034 down and 766 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 451.52 million shares, much more than
346.24 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 1.08 to 346.28. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.51 to 645.00.
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose
3.20 to 579.31.
</P>
<P>
Eastman Kodak led the Dow industrials higher after reporting
that its first-quarter profit rose 4.6 percent, exceeding Wall
Street forecasts. The company also announced plans to buy back up
to 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of its stock.
</P>
<P>
Chase Manhattan, Citicorp, Banc One and Wells Fargo also
reported strong first-quarter profit gains, boosted by interest
income from domestic investments and loans in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
But bank stocks fell as investors took gains on Monday's
advance in the financial sector.

<HEADLINE> UN, Iraq Expect to Reach Deal on Oil-For-Food Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators of the U.N.
and Iraq in oil-for-food talks expected to reach a deal during the
current round of negotiation, according to diplomats here.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari said that he would stay
in New York as long as it took to finalize an agreement during
the current round of talks.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said that the U.N. side was
optimistic about the talks though she did not specify the progress
at the noon news briefing today.
</P>
<P>
She noted that there were still differences on the money
distribution. According to Security Council Resolution 986, Iraq
is allowed to export oil worth 1 billion dollars every three
months to import food and medicine. Thirty percent of the fund
will go to the compensation fund and 130-150 million dollars would
go to northern Iraq to distribute food and medicine free among
Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said that giving food and medicine to the Kurds for free
would violate U.N. conditions for "equitable distribution."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi chief negotiator also accused unspecified countries,
presumably the United States and Britain, of seeking to block a
deal by pressuring the United Nations to renege on terms to which
it had already agreed.
</P>
<P>
But, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright said that the U.S.
wanted a deal to justify the sanctions regime.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials noted that an agreement would defuse pressure
from developing countries and other U.N. members who felt the
sanctions made Iraqi people suffer unfairly.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after it
invaded Kuwait in August 1990. As the long time sanctions have
crippled the Iraqi economy and the country has run short supply of
food and medicine for years, about 500,000 Iraqi children under
age of five have died of malnutrition, flue, bronchitis and other
common diseases.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 986 last April,
allowing Iraq to export oil worth 1 billion dollars for three
months to purchase food and medicine. Iraqi authorities had not
accepted U.N. terms until three months ago.
</P>
<P>
The two sides began negotiations in February. At present, they
are holding the third round of talks, which started on April 8.

<HEADLINE> 300 Terrorists Killed in Algeria in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Algerian security forces
supported by army units killed 300 terrorists in March in raids
launched in the Province of Tlemsan, some 500 kilometers west of
the Algerian capital city of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
According to today's local French-language newspaper Le Matin,
the combing of that area was prompted by information divulged by
four young repentant dissidents who had left the terrorist
organizations, leading to defining the hideouts and strongholds of
the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that hundreds of citizens in Tlemsan and
neighboring areas expressed relief that the security campaigns had
restored law and order, leading to the forming of self-defense
groups to maintain peace and security.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Algerian security forces backed by
army units are combing the Province of Madiya, some 90 kilometers
west of Algers, in search of the French clerics who have been
abducted for 20 days in the vicinity of the province. However, no
trace of them has been found so far.

<HEADLINE> Specific Conditions, Basis of Public Administration: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Public administration,
instead of following a universal model, should be established and
developed on the basis of specific conditions and needs of the
state concerned, Chinese Ambassador Wang Xuexian said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the current session of the United Nations General
Assembly on public administration and development, Wang said that
public administration was closely related to the tradition,
culture and polity of the state concerned.
</P>
<P>
"A particular system of public administration is always shaped
by the specific conditions of the state concerned. The
international community should respect the choices made by a
country in consideration of its specific circumstances," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The success or failure of public administration also had to be
judged by the people of the countries concerned in the light of
their specific conditions and needs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no universal model whose success can be guaranteed
everywhere," he added.
</P>
<P>
Exchange of information among states was always helpful, but
such an exchange must be conducted on the basis of
non-interference in the internal affairs of others, and on the
basis of respect for diversity in the field of public
administration, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations' role in the area had always been to
facilitate exchanges of information and experience, and provide
technical support for capacity building, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It should be emphasized that the strengthening of the UN's
activities in this area should not be achieved at the expense of
its existing role in other areas. In particular, the UN's programs
and activities in the field of economic and social development,
environmental protection, as well as other areas which are of
special concern of the developing countries, should not suffer
negative consequences as a result," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations General Assembly started to discuss public
administration Monday. Officials from various regions have shared
aspects of their national experience in enhancing and streamlining
public administration, aimed at making it more responsive to the
needs of their people. The meeting on public administration will
close Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
reiterated today that the Yemeni leadership, government and people
stand by their brothers in Lebanon and Syria in confronting the
Israeli aggression which the Israeli authorities are exploiting
for election purposes at the expense of the Arab people in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
President Saleh made this declaration in the course of a
telephone conversation with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad. The

President Saleh said that the Yemeni people stand with all
their potentials and hearts by the side of their brothers in
facing this aggression.
</P>

balanced peace that would guarantee the restoration of the
legitimate Arab rights and the termination of Israeli occupation
of Arab lands in Palestine, Syria's Golan Heights and south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that true peace is that which guarantees security and
stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
On his part, President al-Assad expressed his thanks and
appreciation to the Yemeni President for the genuine Yemeni
support.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Extradites Former Azeri Defense Chief to Baku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian authorities moved
former Azerbaijani Defense Minister Ragim Gaziyev who was detained
in Moscow Sunday, to the Azerbaijani capital of Baku earlier
today, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Moscow had extradited Gaziyev, who has been
charged in Azerbaijan with plotting coups in October 1994 and
March 1995, under a legal cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan's Supreme Court in May 1995 sentenced Gaziyev in
absence to the death penalty on charges of surrendering
Azerbaijan's towns of Lacha and Shusha to Armenian forces of
Azerbaijan's breakaway enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
Gazyev, who together with a group of high-ranking military
officers found shelter in Moscow, has also been charged with other
crimes, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Russian authorities have also taken in custody
former Azerbaijani President Ayaz Mutalibov on the request of
Baku.
</P>
<P>
Mutalibov, detained in Moscow last Thursday but moved into one
of Moscow's hospitals later because of a heart attack, has been
charged in Azerbaijan with bids to stage the coups.

<HEADLINE> US Concerned About Reported Russian Military Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States has watched
construction of a vast military complex in the area of the
southern Ural Mountains of Russia, but the U.S. government could
not exactly speculate its purpose, U.S. Navy and Pentagon
officials said today.
</P>
<P>
They were commenting on a New York Times report today alleging
that Russian is building a mammoth underground military facility
in the Ural Mountains. The paper quoted unidentified U.S.
officials as saying that the project could be anything from an
underground nuclear command post to a weapons production plant.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Navy Capt. Michael Doubleday told a Pentagon briefing that
the reported Russian military project "has been observed by the
Pentagon and others" for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have asked Russians about the project, but "they
have not provided, at this point, any kind of description of
exactly what this facility is," Doubleday added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the project might violate agreements under which the
United States is helping the Russians dismantle some of its
nuclear weapons, the Navy officer replied, "We know that the
Russians, like we, are engaged in some military modernization
programs, and we certainly believe that they have the right to do
that; so do we."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokesman Glyn Davies today
said that the Russian project concerns U.S. officials but is not a
priority issue in Russian-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility that the issue would be raised
during the forthcoming summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow later this week.
