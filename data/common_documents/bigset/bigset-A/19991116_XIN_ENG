<HEADLINE> Ivanov Sees Anti-Russia Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Monday that an anti-Russian campaign has gained
momentum under the pretext of events in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"An anti-Russian campaign is strengthening and attempts are
being made to use events in Chechnya as a foundation for it,"
Ivanov said at a press conference after meeting the ambassadors of
the seven major industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement came amid mounting pressure from the West on
Russia to ease its military operation against rebels in the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
The military campaign was launched about seven months ago
following Chechen rebel incursions into neighboring Daghestan and
a series of terrorist bombings that killed over 300 people in
Moscow and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
Russian authorities have accused Chechen warlords Shamil
Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian native known only by his last
name, of masterminding the attacks.
</P>
<P>
It was widely reported that Western leaders would exert more
pressure on Russia during the upcoming summit of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), scheduled for
November 18-19 in Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin said Monday President Boris Yeltsin will lead the
Russian delegation to the summit.
</P>
<P>
"If someone tries to revise the agenda of the OSCE summit in
Istanbul and play the Chechen card, such states will assume
responsibility for the way this meeting will proceed," Ivanov
warned.

LUSAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police have offered a
reward of 10 million kwacha (about 4,000 U.S. dollars) for the
information leading to the arrest of two suspects involved in the
killing of Wezi Kaunda, son of former Zambian president Kenneth
Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman Monday urged Zambians to cooperate with
police to arrest the two because they are dangerous criminals,
Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation television reported.
</P>
<P>
After Wezi, 48, was shot outside his Lusaka residence on
November 3 and died in hospital on the following day, two suspects
have been arrested while two others are still at large.
</P>
<P>
According to the police spokesman, three Scotland Yard
investigators arrived in the country last Saturday to complement
Zambian police investigations on the murder of Wezi, who was very
active in the opposition United National Independence Party led by
his father.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Say Germany's Nazi Slave Labor Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 15 (Xinhua)-Lawyers representing the Nazi slave
labor victims Monday raised new demand to German government and
business, saying the German side's offer "fully unsatisfying."
</P>
<P>
German lawyer Michael Witti and his U.S. colleague Edward Fagan
told a press briefing in Berlin that the German side should pay at
least 10 billion marks, two thirds coming from the business, to
achieve a compromise in coming negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"That should be at least ten billion marks," said Witti.
</P>
<P>
The Munich-based lawyer quoted Scholars' studies that the Nazi
regime had earned 16.23 billion reichsmarks from slave labors, and
the sum, with interests adding, would account for today's 180.5
billion marks.
</P>
<P>
Fagan said the new round talks scheduled to begin this Tuesday
would "possibly end without any positive results," if German side
could not further raise its offer.
</P>
<P>
By now the stands of two sides are "far apart," Fagan stressed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this day, German government agreed to raise its
contribution to the compensation fund by 50 per cent to 3 billion
marks, echoing the demand of its mediator Otto Graf Lambsdorff.
</P>
<P>
Lambsdorff urged German government and business to raise their
offer by one billion marks each on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The German side had in previous rounds offered a 6-billion-mark
compensation fund, 4 billion from some 30 leading German companies
and 2 billion from the government. But victims' lawyers rejected
the offer.
</P>
<P>
Fagan said between 400 to 500 German firms, which had deployed
slave labors in Nazi regime, should take part in the fund.
</P>
<P>
German concerns, including Daimler Benz, Volkswagen and
Siemens, deployed tens of thousands of slave labors in Nazi
regime. According to deferent statistics, today between 700,000 to
over 2 million people, including survivors and victims' relatives,
are demanding compensation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mideast Coordinator Arrives in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Middle East Special
Coordinator Dennis Ross arrived in Israel Monday, the first since
the Oslo tripartite summit earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Ross planned to hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
Monday night to discuss the final-status negotiation developments,
but now he may have to face with the standoff between the two
leaders first.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat held a secret meeting in the Tel Aviv area
Sunday night, but failed to resolve a dispute over what areas of
the West Bank are to be turned over to the Palestinians, which
delayed the second-stage Israeli troops withdrawal from the West
Bank scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian officials demanded the transfer of areas more
densely populated than Israel had proposed.
</P>
<P>
At the Oslo summit in Norway on November 1-2, Barak and Arafat
promised U.S. President Bill Clinton to work hard for peace and
Ross also pledged to visit the Middle East frequently for
mediation.
</P>
<P>
During the planned second stage land transfer, 2 percent of
West Bank land will be turned from joint into full Palestinian
control and 3 percent from sole Israeli rule to Palestinian civil
administration.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Consumer Price Rises by 0.7 Percent in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Consumer Price
Index (CPI) rose by 0.7 percent in October, bringing the annual
inflation rate in the first 10 months to 2 percent, the Central
Bureau of Statistics (CBS) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The CPI increase, as expected by most economists, was mainly
due to the seasonal price rise in clothing and footwears, which
jumped by 9 percent in October and contributed 0.4 percent to the
general index, the CBS said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the latest figure, economists expected the annual
inflation rate for this year to be 2.9 percent, the lowest in 31
years and well below the government's target of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
They said, however, that the Bank of Israel is unlikely to
lower the interest rate despite the record low inflation figure.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli currency shekel, which may devalue before the end
of the year as investors might seek shelters in dollars over fears
about the Y2K computer bug, could be harmed by the lowering of the
interest rate, they said.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate stands at 11.5 percent after a half
percentage cut in August.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel announced Sunday that he
would step down early next year, 18 months before his second
five-year term expires.
</P>
<P>
The tight monetary policy Frenkel adopted has helped slash
Israel's inflation from a double-digit figure to the current
record low level. Investors expected that his successor would not
make dramatic changes to his policy, at least in a short period.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Monday asked Elhanan Helfman, a
professor of economics at both the U.S. Harvard University and the
country's Tel Aviv University, to replace Frenkel as the next
governor of the central bank, and is waiting for his reply,
Barak's office said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) - European Stock Markets mostly
closed higher on Monday supported by further merger talk in the
telecom and banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 ended up 0.34 percent, or 22 points, at
6533.6 amid strong rallies in a handful of telecoms such as
Orange, Cable and Wireless and BT, which all benefited from talk
of further sector consolidation.
</P>
<P>
"There is definitely more to come," one broker said. "Vodafone
will line up a higher offer... and that will inevitably spark
copycat moves elsewhere."
</P>
<P>
Tech stocks also continued to push higher as Nasdaq's seemingly
inexorable rise continued, with several of the leaders enjoying a
further re-rating.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, shares closed higher buoyed by buying in
Mannesmann and Deutsche Telekom shares. The DAX closed at 5859.29,
up 68.24 points.
</P>
<P>
Mannesmann closed 17.70 euros higher at 203.00 amid gathering
speculation that Vodafone AirTouch will follow up its offer of
43.7 of its own shares for one of Mannesmann's with a full-scale
hostile bid.

In Paris, the CAC 40 rose 36.62 points, or 0.71 percent, to

shrugged off the hesitant mood on Wall Street.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Creates Permanent Secretariat for Joint Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The three members of
the Bosnia and Herzegovina Joint Presidency Monday announced the
creation of a Permanent Secretariat for the Joint Presidency in
a bid to promote the peace process in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was contained in the "New York Declaration"
released by the Joint Presidency after they briefed the Security
Council on the current situation in the country at the
invitation of the 15-nation Council.
</P>
<P>
The Permanent Secretariat "will be responsible to the
Presidency as a single institution representing the aspirations of
all people of Bosnia and Herzegovina," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The three presidents also "agreed that the Secretariat will
be composed initially of at least five people from each
constituent group, who will be co-located in a single building
of the Presidency, and who will be assigned on a full-time basis
to, and work exclusively for, the Joint Presidency," said the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for the three presidency members to hold
the meeting with the Security Council since its 1995
establishment. The meeting also took place on the eve of the
fourth anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords, which guide the
peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretariat will provide continuity for the work of the
Presidency by developing working papers, ensuring that decisions
of the Presidency are properly staffed and implemented, and
serving as a liaison with the Council of Ministers," the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The presidency "ageed further to provide the Secretariat with
sufficient resources and personnel to carry out its mandate by
March 1," the declaration said.
</P>

In November 1995, concerned parties signed the Dayton Peace
Accords in Dayton, Ohio State of the United States.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hails Start of Cyprus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday welcomed the
start of talks on Cyprus between Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in New York next
month.
</P>
<P>
"This is a positive development, but the continuation of
dialogue must be safeguarded," Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said at a press briefing Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said
Monday the fact that Clerides has responded positively to U.N.
chief Kofi Annan's invitation for talks with Denktash illustrated
his positive will for negotiations of substance, the semi-official
Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus were now waiting to see the response from the
Turkish Cypriot side, so that after 25 years a resolution of the
Cyprus problem could get under way, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Annan announced Sunday night that both Clerides and Denktash
had accepted his invitation for talks in New York next month to
prepare the ground for meaningful negotiations leading to a
comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when the
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece, a major supporter of Cyprus, has signed with the island
republic a joint defense pact.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Clerides and Defense Minister Socrates
Hasikos will be in Athens this month to have talks with their
Greek counterparts on the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> Economics Professor Asked as Israeli Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Monday asked Elhanan Helfman, a professor of economics at
Harvard University and Tel Aviv University, to replace Jacob
Frenkel as the next governor of the central bank, Barak's office
said.
</P>
<P>
Helfman, who is currently at Harvard University, has yet to
respond to the request, Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
Barak picked up Helfman as the first choice for the next
governor of the Bank of Israel after Frenkel announced Sunday
night that he would step down early next year, 18 months ahead of
the expiration of his second five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel said he decided to resign because he had already
achieved all his policy goals he set for himself when he took the
job in 1991, especially in driving down the inflation and in
opening up the financial market.
</P>
<P>
His surprise move was seen by some as being taken over dispute
with entrepreneurs and politicians on his tight monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
His policy of keeping a high interest rate has helped slash the
inflation rate from the doubt-digit figure eight years ago to 3
percent this year, the lowest since late 1960s. But it has also
been blamed for a three-year economic recession and high
unemployment, which stands at 8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
He has been under mounting pressure from within the coalition
of Barak to lower the interest rate, which remains at 11.5 percent
after a half-percentage cut in August, to boost the sluggish
economy.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that he was at odds with Finance
Minister Avraham Shohat, who urged him to lower the interest rate
in tandem with the declining inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Both the Tel Aviv stock market and the Israeli currency shekel
declined slightly Monday in a relatively mild reaction to
Frenkel's resignation. The benchmark Maof Index of 25 companies
fell 0.46 percent to close at 427.18 points, and the Tel Aviv 100
index was 0.32 percent down to 434.82 points.
</P>
<P>
After sharply dropping to 4.29 against the dollar at the
opening of the foreign currency market, the shekel went up to
close at 4.236 Monday, compared with 4.208 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some economists have predicted that the stock market and the
foreign exchange market would be jolted by Frenkel's resignation
and Barak's failure to appoint a successor immediately. Barak
announced his choice after the markets closed.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the surprising mild market reaction to
investors' belief that the next central bank chief would follow up
Frenkel's line of keeping a tight monetary policy, which had
created a stable investment environment and supported the shekel.
</P>
<P>
Barak said Sunday night that he is also an advocate of a "tight
financial and monetary policy."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel's Channel One Television Monday,
Frenkel called Helfman, who is described by local media as a
supporter of Frenkel's monetary policy, as an "excellent candidate"
to succeed him.

TEHRAN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian senior military

world over the past 50 years through its economic, military and
cultural policies.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)
Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi said that the U.S. administration
has never observed mutual respect in its diplomatic, economic and
military relations with the developing countries, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. always seeks hegemony in its relations with the
Muslim countries in the Middle East, he said, adding that the
U.S. follows its hegemonic policy in a way that the regional
states can not do something against the U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC commander said that the U.S. policy is detrimental to
the interests of the regional governments, citing that it has
vetoed all the U.N. resolutions against Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S., by developing a sense of insecurity in the Middle
East and making use of the status quo in Iraq, justifies its
military presence in the region, escalates arms race to sell more
advanced arms and even receives the cost of its military presence
in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that none of the regional countries would enjoy
economic progress in light of their relations with the U.S. and
almost all the states see the U.S. as symbol of intervention and
hegemony.

<HEADLINE> Mitchell "Confident" of N.Irish Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator George Mitchell
said Monday he was "increasingly confident" that Northern
Ireland's political parties could resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the parties now understand each other's
concerns and requirements far better than before and are committed
to resolving the current impasse," he told reporters in Belfast.
"I am increasingly confident that a way will be found to do so."
</P>
<P>
The British province's rival parties had agreed that guerrilla
disarmament and the establishment of a home-rule administration
should proceed "as quickly as possible," the former U.S. senator
said.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell has been seeking compromise in the bitter row between
the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Sinn Fein, the
Irish Republican Army's political ally, that has halted the Good
Friday accord in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
Unionists have refused to share power with Sinn Fein until the
IRA begins to disarm as proof that its long war against British
rule is over. Sinn Fein says the UUP has set a condition that is
not in the accord.
</P>
<P>
An independent body monitoring disarmament, headed by former
Canadian army general John de Chastelain, Monday released its
assessment for the parties to examine.
</P>
<P>
De Chastelain's report says disarmament is "a voluntary act and
cannot be imposed." It urges guerrilla groups to promptly appoint
go-betweens with his commission to speed the process.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said his party was "encouraged by
Mitchell's positive assessment."
</P>
<P>
"We share his increasing confidence that the review process has
the potential to achieve a resolution of the current impasse in
the peace process," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Senior UUP negotiator Sir Reg Empey also welcomed Mitchell's
statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the UUP recognized "difficulties faced by the
leadership of Sinn Fein/IRA" but urged republicans to make a firm
commitment to disarmament, or "decommissioning," so that the new
power-sharing executive could go forward.
</P>
<P>
"If unionism is to deliver an inclusive executive,
republicanism must deliver decommissioning," he said. "Both sides
must demonstrate in word and deed their commitment to these issues
respectively if the agreement is to work."
</P>
<P>
The veil of secrecy that has shrouded the talks will be lifted
Tuesday when the parties make public their positions on the issues
that have been under discussion, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
He expected to issue his final report on the peace process
"after these further steps are taken" but did not set a date.
</P>
<P>
Peter Mandelson, Britain's secretary for Northern Ireland, told
reporters, "Only those who are opposed to peace will condemn the
process before it is completed."
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who has backed Mitchell's
efforts along with his British counterpart, Tony Blair, said
Mitchell's statement was "clearly very encouraging."
</P>
<P>
Hopes of progress rose late last week over a new formula
thought to include an IRA concession that a senior figure would
act as a link to de Chastelain's disarmament body.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Schools Urged to Beef Up Anti-drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Health
Ministry has called on domestic educational institutions to pay
more attention to anti- drug education among students.
</P>
<P>
The secondary schools should incorporate regular anti-drug
lessons into their educations programs, Abraham Gebregiorgis, a
narcotics expert with the ministry, told a seminar here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Abraham said that youngsters constitute the greater portion of
drug users in Ethiopia, calling for tightened control on the use
and trafficking of narcotics before the problem would assume
precarious dimensions.
</P>
<P>
The increasing trend of drug addiction by young students is
responsible for deteriorating school discipline, he said, noting
that such a social evil may ultimately deter from the goals set
with the new national educations and training policy.
</P>
<P>
It is largely incumbent upon educational institutions to fight
against the ever-increasing trend of students' drug addiction
while parents and the society at large are expected to play roles
in curbing the problem, the expert said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Government Pledges to Sustain Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has pledged to sustain the current policies of reform, with a view
to achieve a more sustainable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The government will focus on further tax reforms to broaden the
tax base and improve the composition of expenditure through the
medium term expenditure framework, Permanent Secretary in the
Ministry of Finance Raphael Mollel said in Dar es Salaam Monday.
</P>
<P>
Focus will also be placed on completion of the remaining
programs of structural reforms, including divestiture of major
state enterprises and promotion of private investment, Mollel said
at the opening of a three-day Tanzania-Germany annual consultation
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He told the German delegation that Tanzania's economic
performance during the 1998/99 fiscal year and the first quarter
of 1999/2000 continued to be generally positive despite a few
setbacks.
</P>
<P>
"The government continued with strict controls of fiscal
expenditures through a cash management system that kept
expenditure within the envelope of revenues and external aid,
permitting the government to repay substantial amounts of domestic
debts," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The official said that fiscal consolidation has been the main
instrument of macro-economic adjustment, which in turn has
improved the investment environment and helped gaining support
from donors and international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Mollel said any debt relief measures will bear positive impact
on the people's lives and welcomed the German government's
contribution to the debt buy-back scheme.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that German could further consider taking
part in deeper measures aimed at resolving the debt problem.
</P>
<P>
Burdened with a heavy debt of some eight billion U.S. dollars,
the east African country's health and education services have been
deteriorating as 30 percent of the revenue has been used for debt
servicing.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls for More Trade, Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has called on member states of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to increase trade and attract
more investment for the economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the call in his statement read by Vice-President
Christon Tembo at the official opening of the 8th COMESA Council
of Ministers in Lusaka Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of the COMESA is to improve the living
standards of the people in the region, the president noted.
</P>
<P>
"To attain this objective, we need to maintain economic growth
at reasonable levels," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Considering that economic growth would best be attained
through increased investment, we are convinced that increased
trade, between our states, would serve to increase and attract the
necessary investment, " Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said the investment-friendly policies should
provide an enabling environment for the private sector both within
and from outside the region to increase investment and provide
increased employment for the people.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA has over the past 16 years made tremendous progress
in liberalizing trade , facilitating communications and building
institutions, Chiluba said, adding that the challenge for the
future is to build on these achievements.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, COMESA Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha
said if the region is to reduce poverty by half and keep pace with
population growth, approximately 150 billion U.S. dollars will be
required for investment in the short to medium term.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the investment will be for the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of concern that in more than three-quarters of
our member states, food deficit continues to be a perennial
problem, " he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the major contributions of a free trade area in the
region will be in the field of food security, he added.

<HEADLINE> Improved Security Helps Somali Town Have </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The town of Qoryoley, some
80 kilometers south of capital Mogadishu, has a local
administration of its own for the first time since the downfall of
the late regime in Somalia almost nine years ago, reports reaching

</P>
<P>
Visiting British Queen Elizabeth II officially inaugurated the
exhibition where about 60 British and Mozambican companies are

Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism, Oldemiro Baloi, said at
the inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Baloi said that Portuguese-speaking Mozambique, which joined

<HEADLINE> Federal Forces Expand Security Zones in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Federal troops Monday
continued their campaign of establishing "sanitary zones" in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya, making more artillery and air
raids on rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
The attacks targeted militant groupings, equipment and storage
facilities near Chernorechye, Alkhan-Yurt, Alkhan-Kala, Kuary,
Gikalovsky, Alleroi, Shali, Avtury, Nokhchi-Keloi, Dai, Bamut,
Benoi-Yurt, Gekhi, Tsa-Vedeno and Gudermes, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, attacks on Grozny, the regional capital of Grozny,
were less intensive Monday than those in the previous days,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry said that 10-15 percent of
Grozny's residents, mostly men, remain in the city and that rebels
there continued the build-up of resistance facilities in
anticipation of federal offensives
</P>
<P>
Federal forces, wary of the rebels' plans to lure them into
downtown Grozny and then surround them in a trap, are
strengthening their movement to fully surround the city.
</P>
<P>
However, "the intensity of clashes has nearly doubled" as
federal troops approached Grozny," Interfax quoted the federal
forces' headquarters in the North Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Bandits are resorting to old tactics and raising the number of
ambushes. They are testing the federal forces' strength," the
headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 192 federal soldiers have been killed and 482
wounded in the current anti-terrorist operation, it said.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the military campaign about seven weeks ago
following Chechen rebels' armed incursion into neighboring
Daghestan and a spate of apartment building explosions that killed
over 300 people in Moscow and two other cities.

PARIS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
will talk with cultural personalities Tuesday on the protection of
cultural diversity in the forthcoming round of World Trade
Organization (WTO) talks.
</P>
<P>
The press service of the Elysee presidential palace said that
Chirac will receive movie producers, conductors, actors, writers,
composers, interpreters and other professionals in cultural
fields.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that a mobilization of intellectuals and
personalities would be "a demonstration of force" because they
represent the capacity to defend the country's point of view on
cultural diversity.
</P>
<P>
Chirac has indicated several times that he would defend with
great determination the interests of France in the trade talks to
be opened in November in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
He has also warned against "standardization" of cultures which
would result in "a decline of civilizations" and "a sterilized
monoculture."
</P>
<P>
The French president has also warned against merchandising
cultural creation by putting them under the law of the market.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has given its executive body, the European
Commission, a mandate to negotiate in the WTO talks on
guaranteeing its member states the free choice of their own
cultural policies.

BAGHDAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 9,000 Iraqis died in
October of different diseases and malnutrition as a result of the
continuation of the United Nations sanctions, the Iraqi Health
Ministry has said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released on Monday by the ministry indicated that
6,122 children under the age of five died of diarrhea, pneumonia,
respiratory infections and malnutrition last month, while only 272
children of the same age group died in the corresponding month in
1989.
</P>

The statistics showed that 2,918 elderly people died of
malignant neoplasms, diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases,
compared with 439 deaths registered in October, 1989.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed harsh economic sanctions on Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which touched off the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claims that more than 1.2 million Iraqi citizens, most of
whom children, died of various otherwise-curable diseases and

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians will issue a
national currency within one or two years to replace Israeli
shekels, a senior Palestinian official said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a currency will enable the Palestinian monetary
agencies to play a role in curbing inflation and unemployment,
encouraging investment and promoting financial surveillance, Fouad
Hamdi Bassisso, head of the Palestinian Monetary Authority, told
Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
But Bassisso said the currency's debut depends on how the
Palestinian economy develops and how the peace talks between the
Palestinians and Israel progress.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official was in Cairo to attend an Arab League
seminar on the Palestinian monetary system, which was held on last
Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bassisso admitted that the road for building a Palestinian
monetary system is not expected to be easy. "But we will not
hesitate to pursue the process," he said.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the cooperation between the Central Bank of
Egypt and the Palestinian monetary agencies.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding was signed two years ago by the
Central Bank of Egypt and the Palestinian agencies for providing
Egyptian expertise to the Palestinian National Authority, Bassisso
said.

<HEADLINE> 52 Agricultural Contracts Blocked by U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Agriculture Ministry on
Monday said that the U.N. Sanctions Committee had suspended 52 of
its agricultural contracts signed with foreign countries under the
sixth phase of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
A source at the ministry said U.S. and British representatives
at the Sanctions Committee put on hold 52 of the 140 contracts the
ministry signed with companies of France, Austria, Vietnam, Egypt,
China, Germany, Belarus, the United Arab Emirates, India, Spain,
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Italy and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
These blocked contracts were for the purchases of veterinary
medicines and appliances, pesticides, sprinkler irrigation
systems, electricity generators, tractors, pumps, protein fodder,
seeds, diesel engines, spare parts for the harvesters and soya
beans, the source added
</P>
<P>
The sixth phase of the oil-for-food deal ending later this
month allocated 145 million U.S. dollars for the agricultural
sector, said the source, without mentioning how much the blocked
contracts are worth.
</P>
<P>
Only two of the 13 contracts for equipment for fighting drought
have been approved by the U.S. and British envoys.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to sell limited
amount of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys in the
Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its contracts,
arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to alleviate the
sufferings of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> General Blasts NATO for Anti-Moscow Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian general Monday
attacked NATO's eastward expansion as a challenge to Moscow's
national security.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the General Staff, said the
inclusion of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO has
already "sharply changed the balance of forces on the continent,
tipping it in favor of the broadened alliance," the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The zone of NATO's responsibility widened 650-750 kilometers to
the east, thereby substantially curtailing the period of strategic
warning for the Russian Federation, Kvashnin said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia is against "returning to the times of the
Cold War" and has since cut its troops deployed in the western
direction by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moscow froze its ties with NATO when the transatlantic alliance
started its bombing campaign against Yugoslavia last March against
Russia's staunch opposition.
</P>
<P>
Kvashnin said further relations with NATO would depend "on
NATO's sincere intentions to restore relations with Russia and its
readiness to reckon with its views on European security and the
forms of its achievement."
</P>
<P>
"We still think that there is no alternative to cooperation
with NATO and hope for renewing our equal and constructive
relations with it," he said. "But that should not only boil down
to discussions and exchange of information in an illusion of all
is well in the cause of European security."
</P>
<P>
Kvashnin said NATO's new strategic concept "provides for the
expansion of the geography of the possible use of armed force far
beyond the zone of its responsibility."
</P>
<P>
"Not only the growing military-political activity in the former
Soviet Union but the evident attempts to declare these regions a
sphere of NATO security interests are alarming," he said.
</P>
<P>
There was "growing readiness to use armed force in its direct,
most crude form at different levels," Kvashnin warned.
</P>
<P>
"The examples of Kosovo and Iraq are only the first forerunners
of such readiness. One may expect that other territories,
including former Soviet territories, will not be an exception,"
Kvashnin said.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO has undertaken energetic efforts to improve
its arms systems to guarantee its military-technical superiority.
</P>
<P>
Kvashnin also criticized the Untied States for its attempts to
revise key military agreements, efforts that harm Russia's
national security interests.
</P>
<P>
"Attempts at revising key treaties and agreements in the sphere
of the strategic offensive weapons and anti-missile defense
directly contradict Russia's national interests and security,"
Kvashnin said.
</P>
<P>
"The latest events demonstrate that the United States has
almost resolved the issue of deploying an anti-aircraft system
banned by the ABM Treaty," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that U.S. President Bill Clinton's signing of a
pertinent law elevated this task "to the rank of U.S. state
policy."
</P>
<P>
Although the decision will officially be finalized in 2000,
"there are no weighty grounds to expect the United States will
give up the idea of establishing its national anti-aircraft
system."
</P>
<P>
"In other words, we can say today that the deployment process
has become irrevocable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Russian "would have to take retaliating steps and
raise the effectiveness of our strategic nuclear forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that "the process of further reducing
strategic offensive weapons would be suspended or even halted."

<HEADLINE> Legal Framework Urged for Internet Economy: Experts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Internet, undergoing
skyrocketing development, has produced a spate of challenging
issues while working its way into China's economy, culture, media
and society. In response, China must establish a legal framework
to deal with the Web-related problems of the future, experts said
today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Qiren, a professor with the China Center for Economic
Research (CCER) of Beijing University, made the remark at the
meeting on China's Future in the Internet held at the prestigious
school.
</P>
<P>
The Internet has changed China's traditional communication mode
into something shapeless and as yet undefined, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet has brought us new ways of communication, trading,
and even a new lifestyle," Zhou said. "People will feel it is
difficult to manage the Internet with traditional thinking."
</P>
<P>
China linked itself to the Internet only five years ago. The
number of netizens in China, however, has nearly doubled every
year. According to estimates from the Ministry of Information
Industry, the number of people having access to the Internet will
hit 4.5 million by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The World Intellectual Property Organization noted in an
earlier press release that by the year 2005, China will have the
most netizens in the world, taking the place of the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics quoted by Zhou, the Asian-Pacific
Region will witness the most rapid growth of e-commerce in the
21st century. China, following India, will become the country to
most quickly develop e-commerce, with a growth rate of 243 percent.
And China will receive 3.8 billion U.S. dollars of e-commerce
income in 2003.

<TEXT>
<P>
Harry H. Huang, Nasdaq-Amex Chief Representative in the China
Region, noted at today's meeting that the Internet was converting
the current currency economy into an Internet one. Citing stock
trading as an example, he said that 80 percent of the world's
stock trading is done via Internet.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that the Internet has created a multi-dimensional
space that has given birth to countless business opportunities. "
And one can never miss the boat," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vigorous Internet economy, however, has also had some
strong negative impact. The traditional industries sometimes feel
pressed to accept the new trading method, and the situation will
probably intensify if some solutions are not found, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Zhou said it is imperative to map out a sound legal basis
for regulating Internet growth.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that it is now even more necessary for China to
establish legal guidelines for activities of all involved in the
Internet economy.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Asked to Stop Fighting in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon on Monday officially
asked Palestinian guerrillas to stop military activities against
the Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We call on our Palestinian brothers to stop military
activities in south Lebanon because this is not in the interest of
Lebanon," Prime Minister Salim Hoss said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said his government does not support any kind of military
action in south Lebanon except those staged by the Lebanese
resistance movement, "which is doing its job very well."
</P>
<P>
Late in October, the Syrian-based Palestinian Islamic Jihad,
which is strongly opposed to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
peace moves with Israel, returned to the last active Arab-Israeli
front line in south Lebanon after many years of absence.
</P>
<P>
It also announced that two of its fighters had been killed in
recent attacks on Israeli troops in the border zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli occupation troops out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Hoss' remarks reflected the public fear that the Palestinian
action will trigger another large-scale Israeli military action
against Lebanon like the two previous ones in 1978 and 1982.

China Indignant at Remarks by Japanese Official
</P>
<P>
China today expressed strong indignation at the "wanton
remarks" made in Taiwan by Governor of Metropolitan Tokyo Ishihara
Shintaro, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi said.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the Ishihara's so-called "visit of
condolence" to Taiwan, Sun said that the Japanese official's
wanton reference to Taiwan as "a state" has again exposed his anti-
China nature and ulterior motives of undermining China's
reunification cause.

<HEADLINE> EU Supports Peace Efforts in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
expressed its support Monday to the implementation of the Lusaka
cease-fire agreement and the peace process in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The EU will provide up to 1.2 million euro for the
implementation of the agreement, said a statement released here by
the Finnish government, which is holding the rotating presidency
of the EU.
</P>
<P>
It said the fund will cover part of the expenditure of the
Joint Military Commission (JMC) set up under the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement. The EU has previously provided 2.65 million euro for
the peace process in Congo through the Southern African
Development Community, which led to the signing of the Lusaka
agreement by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the EU's support will enable the JMC, whose
function is to monitor the fulfillment of the cease-fire, to
deploy its observers in the Democratic Republic of Congo during a
period of six months.
</P>
<P>
"The EU considers the Lusaka agreement crucial for the
restoration of peace and stability in the DRC and the entire Great
Lakes region. The EU has been concerned of the violations of the
Lusaka agreement and the slow pace of the implementation of the
agreement," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It urges all parties involved to assure full and rapid
implementation of the agreement in good cooperation with the
United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
It added that when peace is restored, the EU will be ready to
consider long-term support to the national reconstruction and
democratization in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Abandons Plutonium Export to Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Department of Energy
has decided to abandon the proposed export of weapon-grade
plutonium to Canada, The Globe And Mail of Canada reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Energy Department was quoted as saying in a statement
Friday it has "determined that adequate reactor capacity is
available in the United States."
</P>
<P>
Ever since Canada put forward its proposal for the import of
U.S. plutonium in 1994, the country has been in controversy with
the U.S. Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
Under the Canadian plan, the plutonium would be burned at
reactors owned by Ontario Power Generation Inc.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Energy Department considers the plan to be more
costly than at U.S. civilian reactor, according to the Canadian
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
With the U.S. no longer interested in Canada's proposal, Russia
is the only country left for Canada to proceed with its scheme to
import plutonium from nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. and Russia have a similar surplus of up to 33
tons of plutonium to make about 5,000 bombs.

PARIS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Transport
Jean-Claude Gayssot began a 48-hour visit to Angola Monday to
seek possible opportunities of investment, especially in civil
aviation and railways, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by the heads of the French Civil Aviation bureau
and the Air France air company, Gayssot will visit a railway line
in the province of Benguela in southern Angola, which needs
reconstruction after being paralyzed by the civil war since 1975.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted the French embassy in Luanda as saying that the
visit is aimed at consolidating cooperation in the field of
transport, in particular in the sectors of civil aviation and
railways.
</P>
<P>
About 100 French enterprise leaders visited Angola in November
1997 and some of them have identified their cooperation partners
in the fields of portable water, telecommunications, engineering
studies, support services to oil industry, food-processing,
railways and insurance.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Backs Turkish Cypriot Leader on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will continue to support
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on the Cyprus issue, a
Foreign Ministry statement said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Denktash announced that he would
attend "proximity talks" in New York, the United States, on
December 3 with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Turkey completely supports and shares the
sensitivities and position put forward by Denktash earlier in the
day about indirect talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Turkish Cypriot side "do have the constructive
position and common views which are based on today's realities
and the experiences in the past concerning the way for finding a
just and lasting compromise on the island," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that "it is clear that a new common life on the island
can be possible only on the basis of sovereign equality. As a
guarantor country and the motherland, Turkey will continue to give
Mr. Rauf Denktash the powerful support within the framework
support of our common views."
</P>
<P>
The state said Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side stressed
that current atmosphere is not suitable for direct talks on
Cyprus, adding that "the basis for negotiation should be prepared
for a comprehensive initiative for a lasting solution through the
talks with the mediator."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Direct negotiations between the two sides on the island have
not been held in the past two years because of preconditions set
by Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side for the recognition of the
breakaway republic in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Sunday in New York, United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the acceptance by the two
sides for the "proximity talks."

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Calls for Tightened Sanctions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, South Africa, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth
governments urged Monday the international community to fully
support the implementation of the United Nations sanctions on the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The just-ended Commonwealth summit said in a communique that
the Commonwealth leaders expressed their grave concern over the
continuing suffering of the people of Angola and accused the UNITA
for the breakdown of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The leaders urged for immediate humanitarian assistance to the
country, especially for the displaced.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the leaders of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) attending the Durban summit,
SADC leaders have agreed to speed up their assistance program to
the Angolan government in its fight against Jonas Savimbi's rebel
movement UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The SADC leaders met in George in the Western Cape some 1,000
kilometers away from the summit venue and held a
two-and-a-half-hour meeting on Angola and other regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed that they should do more to help the Angolan
 government.
</P>
<P>
A real and dynamic co-ordinated program should be put in place
to deal with the Angolan government's humanitarian request, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said not enough has been done to help the
government of President (Jose) Eduardo dos Santos against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Angolan government has not invited the SADC to send
troops to the country in fighting against the rebels.

<HEADLINE> More Crocodiles Processed in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 19,000 crocodiles
were processed for their meat and skins at two Niloticus ranches
in Kariba, north Zimbabwe, this year, Innscor company revealed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of crocodiles processed represents a 40-percent
increase compared with that in the previous year, said the group
company which comprises several fast food outlets and restaurants
in Zimbabwe and other southern African countries.
</P>
<P>
"As the world market for crocodile skins continues to improve,
a further 40-percent increase in the number of skins is forecast
for the coming year," Innscor said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Crocodiles were previously bred for their skins that were being
used in the manufacture of bags, shoes and belts.
</P>
<P>
Crocodile farmers are now also capitalizing on the rising
demand for crocodile tail meat which is a delicacy in some markets
in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Meat exports account for 20 percent of turnover for the
company. The abattoir has the added advantage of reducing the
company's dependence on a single product," the company said.
</P>
<P>
Crocodile exports and prices are expected to rise in the next
few years on the back of improved Asian economies, the company
said.

<HEADLINE> Africa Needs Proven Technologies in Fight Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 15 (Xinhua) -- African governments are failing
to effectively deal with the HIV/AIDS pandemic partly because of
the absence of proven technologies and methods that work in an
African context, the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The problem was being compounded by the lack of resources which
were being allocated in the fight against the pandemic, the
Zimbabwe News Agency quoted the USAID as saying.
</P>
<P>
"While new technologies are showing promises, they all require
more resources in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS," said the
U.S. agency.
</P>
<P>
It said the governments in the southern African region needed
to be seized with the immense gravity of the pandemic as it
seriously affected the national human capital base.
</P>
<P>
The agency said U.S. ambassadors and USAID mission directors in
the region were discussing policy issues related to voluntary
counseling, testing and mother-to-child HIV transmission, in an
effort to develop a regional strategy in the fight against
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Last month, seven U.S. ambassadors, nine USAID mission
directors and several technical directors from the region met in
Harare to discuss ways of tackling the HIV/AIDS problem
effectively.
</P>
<P>
The southern African region was said to have the highest AIDS
cases in Africa.

KATHMANDU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Nepal Electricity Authority
(NEA) has decided to increase the electricity tariff by 25 percent
for industrial and business clients and by 30 percent for general
clients effective from November 17.
</P>
<P>
NEA said in a press release issued Monday that the increase of

recent years.
</P>
<P>
NEA is under pressures from foreign donors to hike the
electricity tariff immediately so as to mobilize resources
required for construction of electrification projects, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
Only 15 percent of the 22 million population in Nepal have
access to electricity service so far. NEA is striving to expand
electricity service to more people, especially those in rural
areas.

<HEADLINE> UAE Fully Backs Palestinian Rights: PLO Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Abu Mazen, secretary
general of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, said here on
Monday that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) fully supports the
Palestinian people's legal rights to set up an independent state.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely pleased with the visit to be paid by Sheikh
Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, minister of information and
culture, to the Palestinian territories," the official told the
Emirates News Agency (WAM).
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's visit Sunday is an embodiment of the UAE's support
to the nascent Palestinian state, he added. Abdullah will be the
first UAE official to visit the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Abdullah will lay the foundation stone for a
50 million-U.S.-dollar construction project funded by UAE
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
The Zayed City project will be implemented in two phases in
three years at Bet Lahya, north of Gaza. It will contribute in a
big way toward solving a number of Palestinian economic and social
difficulties, WAM said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, currently in Bahrain, said on Monday that the visit
is to familiarize himself with the situation there. He also urged
all the Arabs to give both moral and material support to the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace talks are at a critical stage which
requires all Arab and Islamic countries to extend the necessary
political backing to the Palestinians, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the final status talks will be meaningless unless
the Jerusalem issue is put at the center of negotiations and a
solution is reached to the satisfaction of the Arab and Islamic
world.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Abudllah led an Arab campaign in September against Walt
Disney over an Israeli exhibit which depicted Jerusalem as the
Jewish state's capital.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazen arrived in the UAE earlier in the day. He had a
discussion with Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sheikh
Hamdan Bin Zayed Al Nahyan on bilateral relations and the latest
developments in the Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Inventories Rise While Sales Fall in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stockpiles of goods on
shelves and backlots increased in September, but sales fell for
the first time since the beginning of the year, the Commerce
Department reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that total business inventories rose by 0.4
percent, the biggest increase since a 0.5 percent gain in March,
to 1.12 trillion dollars. In August, total business inventories
grew by 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, however, sales fell by 0.2 percent in September,
following a strong 1.2 percent gain the month before. The only
other time this year that sales dropped was in January, when they
declined by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
This brought the inventory-to-sales ratio to 1.33, meaning it
would take 1.33 months to exhaust inventories at the September
sales pace.
</P>
<P>
In a manufacturing survey by Dun &AMP; Bradstreet last week,
executives reported no evidence of an unusual buildup of business
inventories in anticipation of any supply problems related to the
Y2K computer bug. Y2K refers to possible Year 2000 breakdowns of
computer systems that can't distinguish between 2000 and 1900.
</P>
<P>
U.S. robust consumer and business spending and a strong buildup
in inventories held by businesses boosted the nation's GDP growth
of a big 4.8 percent rate in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Businesses, confident that consumers will keep spending,
increased their stockpiles in the third quarter, following a
slowdown in inventory building in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Institution Sees Stronger Export in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Export Development
Corporation (EDC) Monday forecast a growth of at least 6 percent
in the country's export sales in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The forecast highlights include a 7 percent increase in
Canada's exports to the U.S. and another 7 percent to Japan and
other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"And the growth should be achievable for exporters in all
regions of Canada," said EDC chief economist Stephen Poloz in a
release of export forecast.
</P>
<P>
Stronger world economic growth, firmer commodity prices and
continued economic expansion of the U.S. are all contributing to
the predicted growth of Canadian exports, according to EDC.
</P>
<P>
Export growth in 1999 will be about 12 percent, driven almost
entirely by strong U.S. demand, the EDC release said, adding two
thirds of the increased sales are due to automotive and parts
exports.
</P>
<P>
The institution, however, sees the country less reliant on the
U.S. next year with the recoveries in Asia and Latin American, as
well as with the improved economies in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Exports account for about 43 percent of Canada's output,
generating one third of the country's employment.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Raps Declaration of Breakaway State in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government, political
parties and students organizations condemned on Monday the
declaration of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic in northern
Cyprus 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided as the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-controlled south since 1974 when
Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots, backed by Turkey, declared in 1983 a
breakaway republic, now recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The peace process on the island has been stalled since
1997. The Turkish Cypriots have conditioned the resumption of the
peace talks on the recognition of the breakaway republic, a
request rejected by the Cypriot government and world community.
</P>
<P>
Police and the United Nations Peace-keeping Forces had taken
strict security measures on the day to avert possible incidents.
</P>
<P>
Culture Minister Ouranios Ioannides, in his message to the
students, said "the illegal regime (in north Cyprus) is a crime
against the U.N. charter and every principle of law."
</P>
<P>
He said Monday's anniversary "should make our determination
stronger in resisting" the Turkish occupation forces. Turkey still
stations 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Ruling Democratic Rally party called on the international
community to "take practical measures which will lead to a just
and viable solution to the Cyprus issue."
</P>
<P>
Opposition left-wing AKEL party condemned the "crime against
Cyprus" and pledged determination to continue the struggle until
justice prevails.
</P>
<P>
In its message, Socialist EDEK party stressed the need to
exert effective pressure on Turkey to allow substantial prospects
for a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
It said the unilateral declaration of the breakaway state in
northern Cyprus is part of Turkey's expansionist actions against
Cyprus.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United States
President Bill Clinton on Monday hoped that upcoming talks on the
Cyprus issue will bring about lasting peace and security for the
Cyprus people.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed the hope at a brief press conference in the
presidential palace in Ankara after he held official talks with
his Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
After inter-delegational talks, Clinton briefed about the
Cyprus issue over which he discussed with Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Ankara late Sunday night for a five-day
official visit to Turkey as well as to attend the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe summit to be held in Istanbul
on November 18-19.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was hopeful about the upcoming indirect talks
on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash are expected to attend the "proximity talks"
scheduled to be held in New York, the United States, on December 3.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry issued a statement Monday, saying
Turkey completely supports and shares the sensitivities and
position put forward by Denktash earlier in the day about indirect
talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side stressed
that current atmosphere is not suitable for direct talks on
Cyprus, adding "the basis for negotiation should be prepared for a
comprehensive initiative for a lasting solution through the talks
with the mediator."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Direct negotiations between the two sides on the island have
not been held in the past two years because of preconditions set
by Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side for the recognition of the
breakaway republic in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Sunday in New York, United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the acceptance by the two

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Turkey Becomes Engine of Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United States
President Bill Clinton said here on Monday that Turkey has become
"an engine of regional growth."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived here late Sunday night for a five-day
official visit and to attend the summit of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation of Europe on November 18-19, made the
remarks in his speech at the Turkish Grand National Assembly
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he believes Turkey's future will be critical to
shaping the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"On the edge of a new millennium, we have a rare opportunity to
reflect upon our journey -- two nations that started in very
different places, with a shared commitment to democracy, who now
must forge a partnership relevant to the new era."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Turkey managed to set up a bridge between Europe
and Asia as well as between the East and the West.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the U.S. have an annual trade volume of 6 billion
U.S. dollars, including big joint projects, especially in energy
sector.
</P>
<P>
On the Turkish-Greek ties, Clinton said that Ankara and Athens
must work hard to reduce tension in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
"A second way to shape the future lies in reducing tension in
the Aegean -- something that will requires hard work by both
Turkey and Greece."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have been rivals over a wide range of
disputes such as territory and the Cyprus issue. Their tense
relations saw signs of easing up after they extended assistance to
each other when both countries were separately hit by earthquakes
in recent months.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Mannesmann Rejects Take-over Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Mannemann AG, Germany's largest
mobile phone service provider, Monday formally rejected as
"unattractive" the 150-billion-mark takeover offer by worldwide
No.1 in the branch, the British Vodafone Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
The company based in Dueselldorff was preparing for its defense
strategy in world's biggest corporate hostile takeover battle.
</P>
<P>
The decision of Mannesmann president Klaus Esser came following
his meeting with Vodafone CEO Chris Gent Sunday evening in
Dueselldorff.
</P>
<P>
Gent offered to exchange 43.7 of its shares for each of
Mannesmann's 367.9 million shares.
</P>
<P>
But Mannesmann said the offer was "wholly inadequate and not in
the best interests of the company and its shareholders."
</P>
<P>
"Mannesmann believes that the value of this proposal is
extremely unattractive for shareholders," the company said in a
faxed news release Monday, adding, "Mannesmann does not consider a
merger with Vodafone AirTouch as strategically attractive."
</P>
<P>
Analysts in the branch said the British giant would on this
Tuesday announce a hostile takeover through purchasing Mannesmann
shares in open market to achieve a majority in stake. But
Mannesmann is confident.
</P>
<P>
"We have apparently better strategy in telecommunication branch
with greater growth and profit projection," said Mannesmann
spokesman Manfred Sohnlein Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully confident that shareholders hoping for value
rising will adhere to Mannesmann," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mannesmann's domestic wireless network, the D2, is already the
biggest in Germany. With Omnitel and SFR, respective the No. 2
mobile companies in Italy and France, it has become the largest
one in European continent.
</P>
<P>
Vodafone Airtouch, the largest mobile network carrier in the
world with over 30 million clients, has been a long-year
co-operator with Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
But the co-operation has become competition after Mannesmann
offered 66 billion marks earlier this month and entered Vodafone's
backyard, the British market.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Speeds Aid to Turkey's Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Calling the earthquake
that hit Turkey on Friday night "a calamity for Turkey's
children," the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has rushed
tents, blankets, sleeping bags and wood stoves into the affected
area, but cautioned that physical relief is just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, UNICEF delivered about 500,000 U.S. dollars
of relief items, including 100 large tents, 565 wood-burning
stoves, 6,500 blankets and sleeping bags and 10 generators, a
UNICEF news release said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF had staff on the ground within two hours and a rapid
assessment mission is underway in the affected areas. Some of the
UNICEF supplies are being used to set up emergency medical
centers.
</P>
<P>
"The first priority is to meet emergency needs, and that's
where we are focusing resources right now," said UNICEF Executive
Director Carol Bellamy. "But it is heartbreaking, really
heartbreaking, to imagine the emotional trauma that the children
of these quakes must be going through. That's where our agencies
will be focused in the long-term."
</P>
<P>
Friday's tremor came 10 weeks after the devastating August 17
earthquake that affected more than 1 million people and generated
numerous sizable after-shocks.
</P>
<P>
"You don't get used to it after the second or third times,"
said Ingrid Leth, a UNICEF child psychologist. "This kind of
trauma can really be worse the second time around because it
creates an almost constant tension about what might happen next.
In that sense this quake is especially tragic."
</P>
<P>
UNICEF's ability to respond so quickly to Friday's quake is
due, in large part, to its ongoing recovery program in the earlier
quake zone, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the earlier quake, UNICEF helped develop local
capacity to respond to such disasters. Over the weekend, for
instance, local teams that UNICEF had trained back in September in
tent-assembly were able to move in within hours to set up tents as
medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF's long-term relief effort in the Turkey quake zone is
focused on restoring schools and helping children and their
families address lingering psychosocial impacts. The keystone of
that effort has been a national training program that has reached
nearly 6,000 teachers, providing them with the ability to
recognize and address many of the pyschosocial issues among
youngsters in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
For many children, classrooms are the heated tents that have
been provided by UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has a team of 26 working in the newly-affected quake
areas, in addition to staff in the previous quake zone. The group
includes specialists in education, pyschosocial counselling, water
and sanitation, and health.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF, the only United Nations organization dedicated
exclusively to children, works for child protection, survival and
development within the framework of the Convention on the Rights
of the Child, which was adopted by the General Assembly on
November 20, 1989.

<HEADLINE> Chad Angered by Withdrawal of Elf and Shell Oil Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chad is angered by the
withdrawal of the French and Dutch oil groups of Elf and Shell
from the project of sending oil from the basin of Doba in southern
Chad to the Atlantic through Cameroon, according to reports from
N'Djamena on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chadian President Idriss Deby said on the national radio on
Monday that Elf and Shell withdrew at a critical moment, because
it was only two weeks away from a decision to be made by the World
Bank on financing the project.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Chad would seek single an agreement with the
Exxon oil group of the United States and the World Bank to realize
this project.
</P>
<P>
The projected pipeline was expected to be 1,050 kilometers
long, and would have been financed by the World Bank and joinly
developed by Elf, Shell, Exxion and the governments of Chad and
Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between the Chadian government and the northern
nomad people, who are supported by Libya, is believed to be the
reason for the withdrawal of Elf and Shell.

<HEADLINE> Greek Protest Organizers Vow to March to U.S. Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The organizers of protests
against U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Greece vowed Monday
to march to the U.S. embassy in Athens Friday to demonstrate their
opposition to U.S. and NATO policies.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the youth organizations of ruling
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), the Democratic Social
Movement, the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and the Coalition of
Left and Progress have reached agreement Monday on the staging of
demonstrations during Clinton's visit to Greece on November 19-20,
the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
While calling on the Greek youth to exercise its inalienable
right to protest the savagery of the new world order initiated by
the U.S., the groups demanded an end to imperialistic
interventions in the Balkans, in the wider region and in the
entire world.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that nuclear weapons and military bases leave
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The organizers also urged those residents along the route which
Clinton will take from the Athens airport into the city to hang
from their buildings flags depicting the characteristic "target"
used in protests by Serbs during Nato'S Bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The protests against Clinton's visit will take place in more
than 30 cities throughout Greece Friday, and the major ones will
be staged in Athens and the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government Monday held a meeting to examine the
security measures for the protection of Clinton, who will arrive
in Athens Friday to meet with Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos, Prime Minister Costas Simitis and main opposition
New Democracy (ND) leader Costas Karamanlis.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank

Turkish private sector banks to support Turkish purchases of U.S.
goods and services at a time when President Bill Clinton is paying
a state visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important and timely action that will help Turkish

U.S. goods and services through these pre-approved banks," said
Ex-Im Bank Chairman James Harmon. "The facility also will assist
Turkey in buying the capital goods and other products it needs
to build infrastructure, and further increase the trade between

Turkey. 44 of the 47 transactions, and 108 million U.S dollars of
the financing, supported small and medium-sized Turkish
businesses' purchases.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Hails New Bank Law as Boon for Consumers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. new law eliminating
barriers that separated banks, investment firms and insurance
companies for more than 60 years will be a boon for consumers,
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that financial regulators at the federal and
state level will now have to cooperate more closely and be
especially alert to deal with "tensions" created by overlapping
jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan hailed the new law, signed by President Bill Clinton
last Friday, as offering the prospect of a wider array of
financial services plus one-stop shopping for consumers.
</P>
<P>
He said that "It is clear that the consumer will benefit from
the wider permissible scope of activities by, and the more equal
competition among, financial entities." "Management now will be
given greatly enhanced flexibility to determine the best way to
deliver its services to the market place and the market will judge
the correctness of that choice," Greenspan added.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which supporters had tried to get through
Congress for more than two decades, eliminates the barriers
imposed by the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited
banks, investment firms and insurance companies from engaging in
each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
The new law opens the way for creation of financial
supermarkets that sell loans, investments and insurance all under
one roof. Proponents say the changes will save consumers 15
billion dollars a year, offering them greater choice and
convenience and spurring competition.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan tried to allay concerns about how the Fed will handle
its new regulatory powers to oversee bank-holding companies that
expand into selling securities or insurance.
</P>
<P>
He said the Fed's main concern is to safeguard the safety of
the corporation's banking operation. On issues of insurance and
securities sales, the Fed will defer to other regulators, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Greenspan conceded there will be an adjustment period
as regulators at the federal and state level learn to administer
the new law.
</P>
<P>
"The Congress has placed real and effective limits on the
Federal Reserve's authority to supervise and regulate" under the
new law, Greenspan said.

<P>
OTTAWA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada views positively the
signing of the Sino-U.S. agreement Monday on China's admission to
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Trade department spokesman Andre Lemay has said his country is
pleased with the deal after marathon talks, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
"We think it is a positive development, we think this is good,"

Last Friday, Canadian International Trade Minister Pierre
Pettigrew told an international relations group in Montreal that
Canada will promote the the entry of China into WTO at an upcoming

<HEADLINE> WTO Agreement Significant to China, U.S.: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The "win-win" bilateral
agreement signed by China and the United States on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO) has significance for both
sides, experts said here today.
</P>
<P>
The deal, concluded on Monday, has cleared the biggest obstacle
facing China's entry into the WTO and therefore will greatly
accelerate the entry process, said Prof. Xue Yongjiu, director of
the Beijing-based WTO Research Institute, in an interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement signed between China and the U.S. after 13 years
of negotiations is far more important than a normal trade deal,"
he said. "The deal with the U.S., which represents the developed
countries, will have a positive impact on upcoming negotiations
with other major WTO members. It will help accelerate the process.
"
</P>
<P>
The senior professor said that as the deal will enable China to
enter the WTO sooner, help China develop its socialist market
economy, give more impetus to the reform and opening process, and
help build a social mode that is open, fair and competitive.
</P>
<P>
The deal will help Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations to
develop on a full scale, said Sun Weiyan, a professor with the
University of International Business and Economics, who has
studied international business and trade for years.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will allow more overseas investment, including

help strengthen the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Trade and economic relations are an important part of state-to-

relations will improve as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
PORT LOUIS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting top Chinese
legislator Li Peng Tuesday attended the ceremony to hand over to
the Mauritian government a recreation center built with Chinese
aid for senior citizens and disabled people.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Li exchanged hand-over documents with
Mauritian Acting Prime Minister Rajkeswur Purryag, to the loud
applause of 200 representatives of senior citizens from across the
Indian Ocean island country.
</P>
<P>
The center, located at Pointe-aux-Sables, a seaside village in
the northwest of the island, is a complex of two-story houses
linked by corridors and facilitated by bedrooms to house 160
people, a multi- functional hall, a parking lot as well as
basketball and volleyball grounds.
</P>
<P>
Ved Prakash Bundhun, Minister of Social Security, National
Solidarity and Senior Citizens Welfare, expressed thanks to Li for
China's financial aid and construction team, calling the center,
the first of its kind for senior citizens on the island, up to
international standards.

opens to the public.
</P>
<P>
"We thank China for providing the aid," he said.
</P>

<P>
MOSCOW, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia Tuesday expressed
perplexity over the shift of accent in a document by the European
Union on events in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The document, adopted recently by the EU Council of Foreign
Ministers, "applies the criteria of international humanitarian law
to the situation in Chechnya, which is strictly Russia's internal
affair," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is wrong from a judicial point of view. Moreover, it's
hardly circumspect, given the hopes of a criminal enclave in
Chechnya for receiving political indulgence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman disputed EU doubts over "Russia's adherence to
humanitarian principles."
</P>
<P>
This "contradicts the realities of the past few days.
Assistance was efficiently distributed both in liberated districts
and in temporary settlement areas for the relocated people,"
Rakhmanin said, referring to refugees fleeing the republic
following a federal offensive against rebels there.

<HEADLINE> Subclan Clash Kills 5 in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 16 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were
killed and four others wounded when gunmen opened fire in the busy
Manopolio market of North Mogadishu, Somalia, late Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses at the market, three gunmen using
AK-47 entered the market from the southern end, attacking a store
owned by businessmen belonging to the Rer Matan clan.
</P>
<P>
Then, the gunmen opened fire at two businessmen selling food in
the market, killing them on the spot, they said.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen then seemed to have lost control and spread more
rounds in the area, killing two more people and wounding four
others including a woman.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen in the market rushed out with guns, but the
perpetrators had escaped without being punished.
</P>
<P>
However, the businessmen took their revenge soon after when a
vehicle carrying some gunmen passed through the market and a round
of bullets were discharged involuntarily from one of the gunmen on
board the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen belonging to the businessmen in the market who were
still out with their guns in bewilderment returned fire, killing
one of the occupants of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attack is not known. However, people in the
market belonging to the same clan as that of the perpetrators of
the attack said the gunmen were taking revenge against the Rer
Matan people, who two days ago killed one of their men near
Issaley bend, about 35 kilometers northeast of the capital
Mogadishu. The revenge takers belong to the Issa Harti subclan of
Abgal clan.
</P>
<P>
Both the Rer Matan and Issa Harti belong to the main Abgal
clan of faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Vows to Develop Irrigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will facilitate
irrigation development and management by encouraging substantial
investments in the sector, said President Olusegun Obasanjo in the
country's capital Abuja on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The president, who was represented by Vice President Atiku
Abubakar, made the remarks while addressing an international
seminar on the performance of small and medium scale irrigation
schemes in Africa, The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"In our effort to diversify the economy, we believe that
agriculture is the key to finding lasting alternatives to our
dependence on oil revenue, " he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that Nigerians cry of food crisis during the
rainy season and also complain about drought in the dry season,
describing the scenarios as a huge irony.
</P>
<P>
The only way to solve this, he stressed, is to harness the
nation's technology with a view to taking advantage of both
seasons.
</P>
<P>
"Surely, we must endeavor to devise appropriate technologies
for the control of our environment. Well-developed irrigation
policies and schemes would not only minimize our misadventure with
flooding but also channel its adverse consequences to good use
during and after flooding seasons", he said.
</P>
<P>
To check flooding which has ravaged most parts of the country,
he said, the government has resolved not to allow the execution
of any irrigation project without an Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) approval.
</P>
<P>
The EIA would help strike a balance between economically viable
 irrigation projects and the protection of the environment, he
said.

HONG KONG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) could be worth several hundred million U.
S. dollars in annual exports for Australia over the next five
years, Chairman of the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong,
Matthew Cheng, said today.
</P>
<P>
"Exports of Australian farm goods such as lamb, wool, wheat and
cotton should be boosted, as will manufactured goods including
processed foods and machinery," said Cheng, adding that "access
for service providers in industries such as finance, education and
telecommunications should also improve."
</P>
<P>
China and the United States on Monday signed an agreement which
paves the way for China to enter the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Australia-China two-way trade is now worth 50 billion HK
dollars (6.41 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A 1997 study by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in
Canberra estimated that WTO membership for China would lead to a
boost to the Australian economy of roughly 1.8 percent of gross
national product (GNP).

<HEADLINE> China Curbs Rampant Illegal Fishing Along Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China's recent crackdown on
illegal fishing activities involving electric shock devices,
explosives and poisoning along the Yangtze River has dealt a heavy
blow to illegal fishermen, whose long unchecked activities have
now been greatly curbed, the Ministry of Agriculture said today.
</P>
<P>
During the action, more than 1,000 illegal fishing cases were
investigated and 1,298 electrical devices seized. Some 41 of the 1,
313 illegal fishermen have been convicted and will go to jail.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Fishery Bureau under the Agriculture Ministry
of Agriculture, the enforcement activity includes fishery and
public security departments in seven provinces and two
municipalities along China's longest river, including Jiangsu,
Anhui, Hubei, Sichuan, Shanghai and Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze, rich in aquatic resources, is home to many
endangered water animals and fish, and its freshwater fishing
output accounts for 60 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, rampant illegal fishing has diminished the
aquatic resources and damaged the ecological environment along the
river, with some species of fish on the verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhengguo, director of the Yangtze River Fishery Resources
Office under the Agriculture Ministry, said that of all illegal
fishing activities, fishing with electric devices is the most
destructive.
</P>
<P>
"Wherever the electric prod is used, fish, big or small, are
doomed, and even if some survive, they basically lose their
reproductive ability," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Has New Police Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Director Panfilo Lacson
formally assumed the top post of the Philippine National Police
(PNP) on Tuesday from Deputy Director General Edmundo Larroza who
retired upon reaching the age of 56.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada presided over at the turn
over ceremonies at the parade grounds of Camp Crame, the
headquarters of the PNP.
</P>
<P>
Lacson was appointed Monday as PNP chief by Estrada, who told
Lacson that he expects him to perform his best in his new post as
PNP chief and meet the high expectation of various sectors of
society in his leadership.
</P>
<P>
In appointing Lacson, Estrada said he took into consideration
the opinion and sentiments of a wide cross section of the people
who have clamored for reform in the police organization.
</P>
<P>
Upon assuming his new post, Lacson issued a series of
directives aimed at cleaning the PNP rank and file of wayward
policemen.
</P>
<P>
He ordered all PNP personnel using carnapped vehicles to return
in one week to the proper owners. Those who failed to return the
vehicles within the prescribed time frame will face summary
dismissal from service, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 51-year old new PNP chief also ordered that henceforth no
PNP personnel must play golf during office hours.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Lacson warned unscrupulous policemen who stop
vehicles for imaginary traffic violation with an evil purpose of
collecting money from hapless drivers. He said there will be no
mercy for these abusive traffic policemen.
</P>
<P>
The new chief called the 110,000-strong PNP personnel to render
faithfully to serve the country and vowed to instill discipline,
honesty and integrity in the PNP to "earn the respect of the
people".
</P>
<P>
Lacson, who was head of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime
Task Force before his elevation to PNP chief, also vowed to go
after criminals as he enjoined the entire PNP force to work hard
to protect the citizenry.

<HEADLINE> Manila, MILF Negotiators Hammer out Code of Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Peace negotiators of the
Philippine government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) are now working out a code of conduct to ensure that
sporadic clashes would not happen.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Rolando Zamora said Tuesday that the code
of conduct would prevent some field commanders of the MILF from
becoming "too aggressive" while peace talks between the government
and the rebels are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
"We are talking peace with the MILF, but some of their
commanders become aggressive. This affects unarmed civilians and
even schools. That's why we are working out a code of conduct,"
Zamora said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
But he also made it clear the government remains on top of the
situation, and that the code of conduct is in line with the
"development first policy of President Joseph Estrada for
Mindanao".
</P>
<P>
The president, he noted, had vowed to develop Mindanao into the
country's next food basket and rescue its people from poverty
through agricultural modernization and the massive infusion of
government resources into the island.
</P>
<P>
"Before we resort to guns and violence, we must exhaust all
peaceful means first. We don't gain anything from the deaths of
fellow Filipinos. So we look at their legitimate grievances and
map out a plan of action to address these grievances," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, government and MILF troops engaged in an encounter
in Maguindanao province in Mindanao, with the MILF taking several
residents hostage and eventually releasing them.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF opened formal peace negotiations in
Maguindanao on October 25 and expects to resume them later this
month.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the government forged a formal peace talks with the
Moro National Liberation Front headed by Nur Misuari, who is now
governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Stresses Role of UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen stressed today that despite an international situation
which has undergone profound changes at the turn of the century,
relevant U.N. principles are not yet out-of-date and should be
followed.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks in a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan this evening, according to sources from the Chinese
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He noted both the opportunities and challenges encountered by
the United Nations (U.N.), and said that China values and supports
the U.N. in playing its due role in international issues,
according to its charter principles.
</P>
<P>
"Any acts to bypass and disregard the U.N. will go nowhere," he
warned, saying that history has proved that all countries around
the world need the U.N. and the role of the U.N. is irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
China, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, will
continue to safeguard the prestige of the U.N. and the authority
of the Security Council, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian welcomed Annan on his third visit to China and praised
Annan's efforts as the U.N. secretary-general to help highlight
the role of the U.N. and promote world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that since Annan assumed his post nearly
three years ago, he has been instrumental in helping the
international community to focus more on development and other
issues of importance to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed his gratitude for the Chinese government's
strong U.N. support over the years, and said that the whole world
needs to work together through the U.N., a global forum, to solve
the problems facing mankind.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that leaders of all countries will reach a
consensus on the U.N.'s role in the new century at the
organization's millennium conference scheduled for September 2000.
</P>
<P>
Annan also congratulated China on the China-U.S. agreement on
China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and said he hopes
that negotiations between China and some other parties will be
concluded soon.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that a new round of trade negotiations to be
held in Seattle, the U.S., will be successful, enabling developing
countries to enter the global market fairly.

<HEADLINE> Israel Must Carry Out Redeployment: Ross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East Special
Coordinator Dennis Ross on Tuesday urged Israel to stand by its
commitment over troops withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The United States had stated in the past that redeployment from
the West Bank is a responsibility that Israel has to carry out,
Ross said after meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum signed in September, 2
percent of West Bank land will be turned from Area B (joint
Israeli-Palestinian control with Palestinian civil administration)
to Area A (full Palestinian control) and another 3 percent from
Area C (sole Israeli control) to Area B by last Monday.
</P>
<P>
But a dispute over the withdrawal maps delayed the scheduled
pullback, as the Palestinians demanded the transfer of areas more
densely populated than what Israel had proposed.
</P>
<P>
Ross held talks respectively with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak in Jerusalem and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the
West Bank city of Ramallah Monday night to sort out the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy expressed confidence after the meetings that the
troops withdrawal would ultimately go ahead.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. President Bill Clinton will send him here every
couple of weeks and that he will focus the efforts on helping the
Israeli and Palestinian sides to abide by the timetable of
reaching a framework agreement on permanent status by February 13,
2000, as was stipulated in the Sharm el-Sheikh accord.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Urges Massive Turnout in Parliamentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Tuesday called on the Iranian people, especially the
youngsters, to go to polls in the forthcoming elections for the
6th Majlis (parliament) slated for February 28, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a large gathering of local people in the ancient
city of Isfahan, central Iran, Khatami said that the people should
actively participate in the elections if they support the
revolution and seek further consolidation of pillars of
sovereignty over their own fate.
</P>
<P>
Khatami arrived in Isfahan Tuesday morning on a three-day
inspection tour of the central province of Isfahan.
</P>
<P>
"If you seek to assist the government, a government whose
motto has been development and strengthening of partnership, then
take part in the elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
People's presence is determining under any circumstances, the
Iranian president said, "no doubt, the glory of people's turnout
in polls for the 6th Majlis should surpass that of May 23
(presidential elections in 1997)."
</P>
<P>
Khatami also called on political groups and factions to
abandon disputes and instead of negating each other, think of
positive aspects, offer fruitful plans and rely on the public.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the Iranian people through their massive
turnout in the forthcoming elections would express their
determination for development and progress.
</P>
<P>
Political groups and factions in the country have entered
serious wrangling in recent months. Both the moderates and
conservatives hope to gain a majority in the 270-seat Majlis for a
new power balance.
</P>
<P>
Former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani on Friday also
called on political rivals in Iran to stop quibbling among
themselves, but to work for creating a peaceful society on the
threshold of the 6th elections for Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, currently chairman of the powerful advisory State
Expediency Council, underlined that the Iranian society needs
peace and political stability so that the people would be able to
go to the polls and cast their vote for the candidate of their own
choice in a totally peaceful environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 16 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Secretary General
Rodolfo C Severino has welcomed the successful conclusion of trade
negotiations between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
This could pave the way for China's admission into the World
Trade Organization (WTO), Severino said in a statement, according
to Bernama News Agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"In December 1997, ASEAN heads of government had already issued
a joint statement in Kuala Lumpur supporting China's entry into
the WTO," Severino was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN is also seeking the admission of Cambodia, Laos and
Vietnam into the WTO, he said, adding "this would not only
complete ASEAN's participation in the organization but also move
it closer to the universality of the body, which we all desire."
</P>
<P>
He also said ASEAN welcomed in principle further liberalization
of world trade.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN would benefit particularly from significant
liberalization of world trade in food and agricultural products,
freer movement of persons and the lowering of tariffs on
labor-intensive manufactured products, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian met with Wladimir Filatov, chief of the Joint Staff of the
Armed Forces of Venezuela, here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission
and a state councilor, said that China and Venezuela have no
conflicts in their fundamental interests but instead share much
common ground. The relations between the two countries have
witnessed smooth development since they forged diplomatic ties 25
years ago, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chi noted that Filatov's present China trip would boost Sino-
Venezuelan ties and the relations between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Chi expressed his appreciation of Venezuela's adherence to the
"one China" position, stressing that Taiwan is an inseparable part
of China. The theory of "two states" created by Taiwan's Lee Teng-
hui indicated a "very dangerous" step in his practice of splitting
China, which will never be allowed by the Chinese people,
including the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Filatov said that he was pleased to see the growth in bilateral
cooperative relations over the past 25 years. Venezuela will
always stand by the Chinese side concerning the issue of China's
reunification, he told Chi.
</P>
<P>
Filatov is visiting China as guest of Fu Quanyou, chief of the
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Backs China's Early Entry into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has been always
supporting China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
which will be conducive to the development of global trade, Srirat
Rasatapana, Thailand's commercial minister to the WTO told Xinhua
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Srirat made the comment after China and the United States
reached a bilateral trade agreement on Monday, which paved the way
for China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Big as it is, China is playing a more and more important role
in world trade, Srirat said.
</P>
<P>
Rich in trade resources, China will further promote its trade
with Asian economies and countries around the world by entering
the world trade body, she said.
</P>
<P>
That's one of the reasons why most of the countries in the
world wanted China to be member of the WTO as soon as possible,
she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said China's entry to the WTO will contribute
both gains and losses to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thai commodities, especially farm products, will find it easier
to enter the Chinese market after China's entry since China will
have to come up with annual import quotas and gradually lower
import tariffs over the next few years, the Thai minister said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Thai businessmen will have more security in
running businesses in China, thereby enhancing Thailand's business
opportunities in China.
</P>
<P>
However, she said China would also become Thailand's major
competitor in the international market, as it will be granted most
favored nation status and no longer be discriminated against by
certain countries with anti-dumping measures.
</P>
<P>
China, as the biggest developing country in the world, would
help balance negotiating power against developed countries in the
world trading forum.
</P>
<P>
"China will be the big brother of developing countries and Asia
in bargaining with the West," she said.

CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's balance of payments registered a surplus of
231.5 million U.S. dollars in October this year, compared with a
deficit of 10.5 million dollars in September.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank said Tuesday that the surplus mainly came out
of the issuing of 200 million dollars of special three-year
treasury bills to pay off overdue bills for construction, hospital
services and real estate acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
The balance of payments recorded a cumulative surplus of 189.9
million dollars in the first 10 months of 1999 against a deficit
of 429.3 million dollars in the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Lebanon's balance of payments saw a deficit of 487
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's banks will be closed to the public on
December 30-31 in a bid to monitor their computer systems against
the so-called Y2K computer bug, the Central Bank said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank had said earlier that banks would be closed
from December 31 to January 3, 2000.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanese Minister of Economy and Trade Nasser Saidi
has predicted that his country's economy growth would reach 3
percent in 2000, the Daily Star newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I expect growth to reach 1-2 percent this year, rising to 3
percent in 2000," Saidi said.
</P>
<P>
He said his optimism was partly based on a strong Lebanese
pound, lower interest rates and better regional business
conditions.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT -- Kuwait will host for the first time the 12th
conference of the Arab Cities Organization on April 24-26, 2000,

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Breakthrough Seen Possible in N.Ireland Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble said Tuesday that a
coalition government could be created if the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) appointed a mediator to hold talks with the disarmament
monitors.
</P>
<P>
"We now have a chance to create a genuine partnership between
unionists and nationalists in a novel form of government," Trimble,
who will be the new government's first minister, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The UUP statement was the latest in a series of positive
gestures since Monday when U.S. Mediator George Mitchell expressed
his "increasing confidence" in the implementation of the Good
Friday accord by all parties involved.
</P>
<P>
The review of the Good Friday agreement by Mitchell has entered
the 11th week amid signs of a "breakthrough" in the stalled peace
process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"If in our view a genuine and meaningful response is
forthcoming to Monday's statement from the Independent
International Commission on Decommissioning, the way will then be
clear for the establishment of the political institutions
envisaged in the Belfast Agreement," the UUP said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, said that disarmament was an essential part of
the Northern Ireland peace process, pledging to oppose the use of
force for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote statement, Sinn Fein said the disarmament issue
could be resolved with the help of the authorities in charge of
arms decommissioning authorities in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"Sinn Fein accepts that decommissioning is an essential part of
the peace process," said Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
Former Canadian army general John de Chastelain, chairman of
the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning,
Monday called on the IRA and other guerrilla groups to appoint go-
betweens to discuss how the arsenals that sustained 30 years of
bloody conflict could be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the IRA is expected to issue a statement on
Wednesday or Thursday, which is likely to accept de Chastelain's
request for a mediator.
</P>
<P>
Political sources said if Trimble can sell the deal to his
party, a coalition government may be formed by December 8. Trimble
will call a meeting of his party's 850-strong council on November
27 to make a decision on it.

<HEADLINE> Deep Water Oil Exploration in Nigeria Encouraging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Oil companies operating in
Nigeria have achieved encouraging results in deep water oil
exploration although a total of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars was spent
between 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Shell's deep water oil exploration in its Bonga field has come
up with exciting results which can be compared to the huge
discoveries made in Angola, Congo, the Gulf of Mexico and the
North Sea when brought on stream by 2001, This Day newspapers
Tuesday quoted Elf General Manager Daniel Ndafe as saying.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said that the Bonga discovery held billion of
barrels in proven reserves, making it biggest discovery by any of
the multi- nationals operating in Nigeria's deep offshore region.
</P>
<P>
The general manager told a workshop organized by the Nigerian
Association of Petroleum Exploration that the country's deep water
terrain could hold the key to meeting the government's set target
of increasing daily crude oil production to four million barrels
per day and total reserves to 40 billion barrels by the year of
2010.
</P>
<P>
Ndafe said that from 1993 to 1998, 33 exploration and appraisal
 wells were drilled, 21,000 square kilometers of 2-D seismic work
conducted in the frontier terrain and an additional 21,500 square
kilometers of 3-D seismic work carried out.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Profit from China's Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korea hails the signing of
Sino-U.S. agreement over China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and expects to see more profits than losses
from the accession.
</P>
<P>
South Korean media reports Tuesday said that South Korea will
not suffer a grave impact by China's entry into WTO at least for
the time being though some warned of a possible fall of South
Korea's product competitiveness overseas.
</P>
<P>
South Korean auto exports to China, whose demand for cars in
the next 10 years will reach three to four million units, are sure
to grow if import duties are lowered.
</P>
<P>
In electronics, South Korean exports to China, especially high-
quality products such as large TV sets, multifunctional VCRs and
large refrigerators, will jump if the tariff rate of 30 percent on
industrial products falls below 15 percent over time, said
officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korean petrochemical exports to China such as
ethylene, HDPE and LDPE are expected to soar after tariff rates
are cut. South Korea's petrochemical industry can take advantage
of China's WTO membership. China's demand in this field will surge
20 percent a year while the capacities of the facilities will rise
some eight percent over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
In terms of South Korean exports of high-end steel to China,
they are likely to increase and its exports of chemical fiber yarn
are also to rise.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean agricultural products will not see a sudden
change as the country gives China the same customs status as other
WTO member states do under the bilateral most favored nation
agreement, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
South Korean exports of processed food products and high-valued
added agricultural products are expected to increase.
</P>
<P>
However, the South Korean International Trade Association
predicted that exports from China to South Korea will increase
more than those from latter to the former in the future, and South
Korean industry may be hurt by a flood of low-priced consumer
goods from China.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Elders Live Better Life Than Sub-Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian older people
are living a better life compared to their counterparts in the
war-torn sub-Sahara African countries, a senior official from Help
Age International (Tanzania) said.
</P>
<P>
However, more needs to be done on poverty reduction and
medical service for the Tanzanian elderly population, the
organization's program director Liz Holmes told the Daily Mail
newspaper on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The elderly in Tanzania may be affected by general poverty, but
their counterparts in warring Burundi, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Sierra Leone, Angola and the Sudan are either in
refugee camps or on the run in a bid to save their lives, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
"War, civil conflicts or natural disasters may turn the chronic
daily problems faced by older people in developing countries into
acute emergencies," said the group in its Aging and Development
Report to be launched Tuesday to mark the International Year of
the Elderly.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there are about 1.4 million
people above 60 years old in Tanzania and the number could reach
eight million in the next 50 years. Tanzania now has a population
of around 30.4 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an exhibition opened at the National Museum in Dar
es Salaam Monday to highlight the role of old people in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Older People Cultural Festival, the week-long exhibition
is staged to mark the 1999 International Year of the Elderly.
</P>
<P>
It features art crafts collected by Help Age from various parts
of the country, which had been made or owned by older people.
</P>
<P>
Old people were not a mere burden, Holmes said, because they
are not passive recipients but contributors.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Library Repositories to Be Digitized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The National Library of China
plans to set up the largest Chinese Information Repository on the
Net.
</P>
<P>
Liu Gang, vice-director of the information network department
at the library made these remarks while playing a video
highlighting an experimental digital library.
</P>
<P>
The digital library will enable visitors to step into the
Beijing Imperial Palace, for example, and learn about ancient
Chinese culture and art.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing Imperial Palace" is one of the five repositories at
the National Library of China which will become fully digitized in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
The other four repositories -- "Ancient Chinese Poems", Ancient
Chinese Architecture", "Sea World" and "Structure of the Universe"
will also be digitized.
</P>
<P>
Liu said in the future, digital libraries will be able to
gather information from a number of large repositories. The one
per cent Internet information in Chinese hardly reflects China's
abundantly rich culture, Liu said, adding that some of collections
and repositories come from Hong Kong and Taiwan as well as
Singapore where different coding systems are used.
</P>
<P>
"We're now working to digitize China's 5,000 years of history
and bring together distributed information sources in a manner
that makes them logically appear as part of some larger integrated
system, even though information is distributed in different
websites," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-director explained that in the digital library, users
can make cross-references to other repositories rather than browse
at related websites one by one to search relevant information.
</P>
<P>
Liu called on libraries, archives and data banks to work
closely in digitizing their special collections. The Chinese
National Digital Library is scheduled to go on line next year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister Confers with Annan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua)-- Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
held talks with the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan,
today as they exchanged views on a number of topics, including
global and regional issues, the role of the UN, and China's
cooperation with the UN.
</P>
<P>
Tang pointed out that the UN, as the most representative inter-
government organization in the world, can never be absent in its
role to safeguard world peace and security. Although the world has
undergone dramatic changes over the past fifty years since the UN'
s founding, the gist and principles of the UN Charter are never
out of date, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the gist and principles of the UN Charter should be
reinforced rather than weakened in order to maintain world peace
and stability and protect the rights and interests of all
countries, especially weaker ones, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tang also touched upon the relations between human rights and
national sovereignty, an issue commonly concerned by members of
the present UN General Assembly, pointing out that all countries
should conduct dialogue and cooperation based on equality and
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
China opposes the action to politicize the human rights issue,
and is especially opposed to interfering into the internal affairs
of developing countries in the name of human rights, Tang said,
particularly referring to the so called "humanitarian intervention
" without the authorization of the UN Security Council and the
consent of countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
A country's national sovereignty serves to protect human rights,
Tang said, stressing the necessity to adhere to the basic
principle of equality, mutual respect and non-interference into
each other's internal affairs, which governs state-to-state
relations.

HONG KONG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) will have a positive effect on business
at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), the Hong Kong Airport
Authority (AA) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
AA Chief Executive Officer Billy Lam Chung-lun said the
landmark trade agreement would have a marked effect on Hong Kong's

</P>
<P>
Passenger traffic, notably business-class travel and business
aviation, would also benefit from the expected rapid growth in the

Lam said the latest development added weight to the AA's recent
decision to develop a marine cargo facility and two logistics
centers at the airport island.
</P>
<P>
"This is the second piece of great economic news for Hong Kong
in as many weeks," Lam said, referring to the announcement on
November 2 that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
government and Disney will develop a joint-venture entertainment
theme park on the Lantau Island.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO agreement is a key event for Hong Kong and HKIA is
perfectly placed to benefit substantially from China's entry into
this new era of economic development." Lam said.

Khatami has urged Islamic states to expand their indigenous
capacities for the use of technology for advancement.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed these views in his message which was read out
here Tuesday at the inaugural ceremony of the Ninth General
Assembly meeting of the OIC Standing Committee on Scientific and

Islamic states need a capacity that will allow them to opt for
such choices that correspond to their culture, he added.

If their choices fall into this category, then they will be
"compatible choices" and "appropriate technology", he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> British Sports Minister: I Would Scrap New Stadium Design </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- British Sports minister Kate
Hoey has admitted she would scrap the design for the new national
stadium at Wembley if she was given the chance.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Tuesday, Hoey claims the new
stadium is not representative of all sports but is just a national
football stadium, and she believes flaws in the plans could cost
Britain the chance to stage future Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after details of the 475 million pounds plans for the
new Wembley national stadium had been unveiled, Hoey told the
Yorkshire Post: "Football was determined to win the argument and
it got its own way. It would be very difficult now to completely
turn around the project. I can't start it all again but I would if
I could - absolutely."
</P>
<P>
She continued: "If we want to bid for the 2012 Olympics I don't
think the country's hands should be tied behind its back from the
very beginning by having the wrong kind of stadium."
</P>
<P>
Hoey is not the first to voice concerns about the suitability
of the new 90,000-seat Wembley, intended to be the centrepiece of
England's bid for football's 2006 World Cup but which it is feared
will have to undergo drastic changes in order to host a major
athletics meeting.

but a national football stadium."

Hoey, who succeeded Tony Banks as sports minister four months

The plans do include provision for an athletics track but the

<HEADLINE> Manila Studying Establishment of Philippine Eximbank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to make the country's
export sector globally competitive, President Joseph Estrada
announced Tuesday that his administration is planning to establish
a Philippine Import-Export Bank (Eximbank).
</P>
<P>
The president said in a statement that the proposal was
introduced by the Japan Bank for Industrial Cooperation (JBIC),
who committed to provide a one-billion-U.S.-dollar aid for the
setting up of such a bank.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of a Philippine Eximbank is needed to boost
the growth of the Philippine export industry," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he has already ordered Secretary Edgardo Espiritu
of the Department of Finance to pursue further discussions with
the JBIC and other concerned sectors on the setting up of the
proposed Philippine Eximbank.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu, who endorsed JBIC's proposal to the president,
pointed out the need for the Eximbank to provide long-term credit
facilities and the massive capital infusion required to develop
the country's export sector.
</P>
<P>
Existing financial institutions in the country, such as the
Trade and Investment Development Corp. (Tidcorp) and private
banks, "are not geared to meet the important need for long-term
export finance," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tidcorp's capacity to grant only export guarantees in times of
financial crises, Espiritu noted, "would not help as much as the
provision of direct export credit, particularly long-term credit."
</P>
<P>
The Development Bank of the Philippines, on the other hand,
provides long-term loans, but these are not focused on the export
sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of an institution that provides long-term
credit facilities designed for, and aimed specifically at, the
needs of exporters will help a lot in the development of large and
competitive export industries that require substantial capital to
put up," Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a Philippine Eximbank will also mitigate the
adverse impact of credit crunches and temporary liquidity problems
in the banking sectors that sometimes plague exporters.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
England are considering setting up a TV jury to review video
evidence of controversial incidents.
</P>
<P>
The idea would include a panel of adjudicators who meet
regularly to look at flashpoints during matches which were missed
by referees.
</P>
<P>
The FA already use video evidence in this way and a number of
players have been punished for offences, which were not picked up
at the time by match officials.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Middlesbrough striker Brian Deane was charged with
misconduct for allegedly elbowing Sunderland's Paul Butler in an
off-the-ball incident, which referee Graham Barber did not see.
</P>
<P>
Lancaster Gate officials have been discussing ways of
formalising the review of video evidence for some time.
</P>
<P>
But according to FA spokesman Adrian Bevington, such a scheme
would not be implemented overnight.
</P>
<P>
"It's something we are giving consideration to," he said. "But
it's just a matter for discussion at this moment in time."

BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The newly-developed Jinzhou 9-

million tons of crude next year, according to the China National
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).

mighty loan defaulters would be arrested from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Final touches have been given to legal and administrative
measures which would remove all hurdles, impeding expeditious loan
and tax recoveries, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The law will positively come into force from Wednesday to

</P>
<P>
He said that all the security and law enforcing agencies have
fully been mobilized and measures beefed up to tighten the grop on
defaulters.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets UN Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China has always supported and followed the
principles of the UN Charter, and devoted itself to world peace
and development.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Jiang said China has offered consistent support to the UN and
maintained good cooperation with the Secretary-General. He voiced
appreciation for Annan's efforts to invigorate the UN, push the UN
's emphasis on Africa, and support China on the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The 21st century will soon be here and mankind will enter into
a new millennium, Jiang said, noting that the UN, as the most
important inter-government organization in the world, shoulders
the heavy responsibility of safeguarding world peace and promoting
global development.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the gist and principle of the UN
Charter as well as the five principles of peaceful co-existence
have become universally recognized principles governing
international relations. They serve as a guarantee for world peace
and stability and are in the interests of all members of the
international family, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed the world is a colorful one, and China respects
the universal principle of human rights enshrined in all documents.
Meanwhile, he pointed out, due to differences between countries in
social systems, culture, historical tradition, and economic levels,
there should be different measures in protecting human rights and
divergent forms of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Annan agreed with Jiang's view, noting the UN's make-up and
work fully embody the diversity of the world. The right of
subsistence is a basic human right which is equal to political
rights. The UN, right proceeding from this understanding, has
always devoted itself to the world's economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General congratulated China on reaching an
agreement with the U.S. on its entry into WTO, saying this is good
news for the whole world. Without China's participation, the WTO
is not a highly representative international trade organization,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He also congratulated China on the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic, praising China's considerable
achievements in the past half century. He said the UN is willing
to contribute to China's economic and social development. Annan
also invited Jiang to attend the UN's Millennium Conference
scheduled for September 2,000.

<TEXT>

<P>
MANILA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada received Tuesday an assurance from top officials of the
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) and Globe
Telecom Incorporation to interconnect their services.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is counting on the country's two telecom
giants to open up their access to each other's networks starting
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"They promised that by tomorrow, they will open up their
access with each other. They assured me that," said the president
after meeting with officials of the PLDT and Globe Telecom.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, he also told both companies to
patch up their remaining problems as soon as possible for the sake
of the public.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora and Commissioner Joseph
Santiago of the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) also
attended the meeting held in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Santiago said he felt glad that the PLDT and Globe agreed to
open up their networks to each other, as well as the access number
of the PLDT's cellular phone company, Smart Communications, in
five days' time.
</P>
<P>
He said the PLDT also promised to increase its trunk lines for
the Globe, after its technical team studies Globe's phone traffic
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The NTC, Santiago added, will also look into PLDT's complaints
of illegal bypass, in which calls from other countries are routed
through PLDT's international gateways and "disguised" as local
calls.
</P>
<P>
"It deprives the government of revenues and taxes, and it also
deprives the telephone companies of their revenues," he said.

Launching vehicles allow missiles to be fired at any time and

<HEADLINE> WTO Entry Won't Affect Chinese Pharmaceutical Industry: Manufacturer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of a
pharmaceutical group in north China said today that he looks
forward to China's entry into the WTO (World Trade Organization)
as early as possible and welcomes the challenge of competition
that the new trade deal will create.
</P>
<P>
Lu Weiping, chairman of the North China Pharmaceutical Group in
Hebei Province, said that low tariffs will result in the entry of
many patent pharmaceuticals into the Chinese market, which to some
extent will affect the development of new medicine in China.
</P>
<P>
However, the Sino-U.S. Memorandum on Intellectual Property in
1993 already broke part of the trade barrier, and joint ventures
in the field since the 1990s have already created channels for
foreign medicine to enter China's market. Therefore, China's entry
into the WTO will have no great impact on China's pharmaceuticals,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that any enterprise should make the most of its best
qualities and form a development plan that is globally rather than
just domestically-oriented.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the WTO entry will bring equal investment
opportunity and a fair market, which will inspire domestic
enterprises to make good use of their human resources to expand
their market, he added.
</P>
<P>
China is a large market for pharmaceuticals, and the extensive
and various needs of the people will never be satisfied by imports
alone. As fierce as the competition is, potential is great in the
sector, he said.

<P>
MACAO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-U.S. agreement signed
on Monday has drawn the attention of people in Macao, who think
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will also
benefit Macao which will become a special administrative region (
SAR) of China on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive-designate of the Macao SAR,
said on Tuesday, "The SAR government will pay close attention to
the market situation of the motherland and work out corresponding
policies, so that Macao can achieve better economic growth."
</P>
<P>
Local economists noted that China's entry into the WTO will
pose both opportunity and challenge to Macao. Business people in
Macao have to do their utmost to seize the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
On one hand, Macao's role as a middleman between China and
foreign investors will become more important as Macao has close
ties with the interior areas of China. On the other hand, Macao
business people will find more competitors while investing in the
interior areas of China.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that China's entry into the WTO will make
the country open wider to the outside world and raise the
confidence of investors. A stronger motherland will bring about
favorable benefits to Macao.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- France has intended to
participate in the post-war rehabilitation of the Benguela-Lobito
Railway in Angola's central Province of Benguela, official radio
RNA said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Transportation Jean Claude Gayssot, who is
on a three- day visit to Angola, said that France has rich
experience in railway construction, cargo and passenger
transportation, signalization and security, which will serve the
rehabilitation project.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Transportation Minister Luis Brandao said that Angola
hoped to get "global support" for the reconstruction following a
recent military victory of the government forces.

The railway which links between the Angolan second largest port
city of Lobito and the provincial capital city of Benguela is part
of the 2900- kilometer Benguela Railway running across the country
from west to east, which has long been paralyzed by the rampant
conflicts between the government troops and the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Sends Message to OIC COMSTECH Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has urged Islamic states to expand their indigenous
capacities for the use of technology for advancement.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed these views in his message which was read out
here Tuesday at the inaugural ceremony of the Ninth General
Assembly meeting of the OIC Standing Committee on Scientific and
Technological Cooperation (COMSTECH).
</P>
<P>
Khatami said, the pivotal role of science and technology in
economic, social cultural and political life and ultimately in
different dimensions of the development of countries is one of the
characteristics of contemporary era.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that this meeting hosted by Pakistan shall
attain important achievements leading to the promotion in the
Islamic countries of the level of benefiting from science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Islamic culture and scientific and technological advancements
have an integral relationship, he said, adding that Islamic states
have the capacity for self-reliance and self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
Scientific and technological progress in the context of Islamic
culture must become the goal of all Islamic societies, Khatami
said.
</P>
<P>
Islamic states need a capacity that will allow them to opt for
such choices that correspond to their culture, he added.
</P>
<P>
If their choices fall into this category, then they will be
"compatible choices" and "appropriate technology", he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to make sure that the technologies that have been
selected are best suited to the needs of Islamic societies and
correspond to the special circumstances of Islamic States," said
the president.
</P>
<P>
Khatami asserted that Islamic societies have to expand their
indigenous capacities for the use of technology. Scientific and
technological development must be based on understanding, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that this conference will attain
fruitful results and act as a platform for further advancement of
technology in Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
The COMSTECH, a major scientific forum of the OIC member
states, is being attended by the 32 OIC member countries. The

<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China's prestigious Palace
Museum will open an exhibition tomorrow of the packaging materials
used to hold priceless cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The museum and a French company, Amedeus, are co-sponsors of

packaging made during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists said that the Chinese people in ancient times
wrapped packages in everything from the most primitive rope to
beautifully-decorated cord.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the theme, exhibit organizers have linked all
the displays together with coarse rope and cloth.

<HEADLINE> Manila Studying Establishment of Philippine Eximbank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to make the country's
export sector globally competitive, President Joseph Estrada
announced Tuesday that his administration is planning to establish
a Philippine Import-Export Bank (Eximbank).
</P>
<P>
The president said in a statement that the proposal was
introduced by the Japan Bank for Industrial Cooperation (JBIC),
who committed to provide a one-billion-U.S.-dollar aid for the
setting up of such a bank.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of a Philippine Eximbank is needed to boost
the growth of the Philippine export industry," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he has already ordered Secretary Edgardo Espiritu
of the Department of Finance to pursue further discussions with
the JBIC and other concerned sectors on the setting up of the
proposed Philippine Eximbank.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu, who endorsed JBIC's proposal to the president,
pointed out the need for the Eximbank to provide long-term credit
facilities and the massive capital infusion required to develop
the country's export sector.
</P>
<P>
Existing financial institutions in the country, such as the
Trade and Investment Development Corp. (Tidcorp) and private
banks, "are not geared to meet the important need for long-term
export finance," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tidcorp's capacity to grant only export guarantees in times of
financial crises, Espiritu noted, "would not help as much as the
provision of direct export credit, particularly long-term credit."
</P>
<P>
The Development Bank of the Philippines, on the other hand,
provides long-term loans, but these are not focused on the export
sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of an institution that provides long-term
credit facilities designed for, and aimed specifically at, the
needs of exporters will help a lot in the development of large and
competitive export industries that require substantial capital to
put up," Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a Philippine Eximbank will also mitigate the
adverse impact of credit crunches and temporary liquidity problems
in the banking sectors that sometimes plague exporters.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown on Defaulters from November 17: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Interior
Minister Moinuddin Haider said Tuesday the plan has been finalized
for effective crackdown on willful defaulters with the expiry of
deadline (November 16).
</P>
<P>
In an interview here with the local media, Haider said that
mighty loan defaulters would be arrested from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Final touches have been given to legal and administrative
measures which would remove all hurdles, impeding expeditious loan
and tax recoveries, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The law will positively come into force from Wednesday to
provide legal cover to crackdown," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that all the security and law enforcing agencies have
fully been mobilized and measures beefed up to tighten the grop on
defaulters.
</P>
<P>
All the exit points are under surveillance and no defaulter
will be allowed to flee the country, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "all the exit points have been blocked for defaulters
and none of them could now leave the country."
</P>
<P>
The government provided one month time to loan defaulters and
tax evaders to settle their dues. Those, who avoided settlement of
their dues, will definitely have to face the music, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We want to give a clear message to willful defaulters and the
general public that era of loot and plunder comes to an end and
nobody will be allowed to do so in future," Haider stressed.
</P>
<P>
Accountability, he said, will be impartial, transparent and a
continuous process with the focus on curbing the menace of loot
and plunder.
</P>
<P>
"With the countries whom we have extradition treaty, will be
asked to deport the defaulters and hand them over to Pakistani
government, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall make efforts to bring them back and try them in the
court of law to retrieve the misappropriated money," he said,
adding that movable and immovable properties of defaulters,
staying abroad will be attached to recover the defaulted amounts.
</P>
<P>
This whole process will be carried out under the ambit of law
ensuring that nobody is subjected to any political victimization,
Haider noted.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Telecom Firms to Open Their Access With Each Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MANILA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada received Tuesday an assurance from top officials of the
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) and Globe
Telecom Incorporation to interconnect their services.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is counting on the country's two telecom
giants to open up their access to each other's networks starting
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"They promised that by tomorrow, they will open up their
access with each other. They assured me that," said the president
after meeting with officials of the PLDT and Globe Telecom.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, he also told both companies to
patch up their remaining problems as soon as possible for the sake
of the public.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora and Commissioner Joseph
Santiago of the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) also
attended the meeting held in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Santiago said he felt glad that the PLDT and Globe agreed to
open up their networks to each other, as well as the access number
of the PLDT's cellular phone company, Smart Communications, in
five days' time.
</P>
<P>
He said the PLDT also promised to increase its trunk lines for
the Globe, after its technical team studies Globe's phone traffic
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The NTC, Santiago added, will also look into PLDT's complaints
of illegal bypass, in which calls from other countries are routed
through PLDT's international gateways and "disguised" as local
calls.
</P>
<P>
"It deprives the government of revenues and taxes, and it also
deprives the telephone companies of their revenues," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Supports More SOEs' Technological Upgrading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China's investment in the
technological upgrading of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has
reached more than 12 billion yuan with the recent announcement of
the second batch of 192 projects for the program.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the State Economic and Trade Commission
disclosed today that 351 technological upgrading projects have
been settled to date, and a third group under current examination
will be decided soon.
</P>
<P>
China started a massive SOE technological upgrading program in
a move to expand domestic demand and help SOEs out of difficulties
in a three-year period before the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
"Technological renovation is by no means an expedient task only
for this year; it is actually a strategic policy aimed to realize
upgrading of major state industries that will take several years,"
said the official.
</P>
<P>
China issued an additional 60 billion yuan in state bonds this
year, nine billion of which has been earmarked for SOEs'
technological upgrading. Experts estimated that the money can
trigger 180-billion-yuan investment in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing program mainly involves 512 state key enterprises
and 120 enterprise groups. When the first two groups of projects
are completed, remarkable achievement will be seen in
metallurgical, petrochemical, machine-building, electronic,
textile, paper making and nonferrous metals industries.
</P>
<P>
In the metallurgical industry, for example, the state requires
that nine varieties of high value-added steel products reach the
international level, and a number of technological standards for
steel production be up to a new level.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's Remarks Against Will of Taiwanese People(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency has
published a commentary ridiculing Lee Teng-hui's latest separatist
remarks in the November/October issue of an American bimonthly,
Foreign Affairs, which runs contrary to the will of the people of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In his essay, Lee says that his comments represent the will of
the Taiwanese people.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream of public opinion in Taiwan seek peace,
stability and development, says the commentary, adding that in
recent years, the people of Taiwan have been campaigning for "
three direct services": direct mail, aviation and business
services with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
A latest survey in the island province shows that 84.1 percent
want to maintain the present situation of cross-straits relations,
while only 4.6 percent advocate Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
The commentary criticizes Lee for his neglect of the will of
the Taiwanese people and repeatedly challenging the One China
principle.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui has distorted the will of the people of Taiwan by
saying that the region has forged a national identity concerning
the future of Taiwan. However, the commentary stresses that the
majority of the Taiwanese people see themselves as Chinese and
that there is only one China and support China's policy of "
peaceful reunification and one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
Since Lee took up office, he has worked hard to severe the
history and links between compatriots across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua commentary lists a number of Lee's separatist topics
which include "forging a new Taiwanese identity".

SEOUL, November 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign exchange
reserves rose 2.19 billion U.S. dollars from the end of last month,
reaching 68.4 billion dollars as of November 15, said the Bank of
Korea Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the foreign exchange reserves have kept
rising as the domestic financial institutions continued to repay
the foreign currency loans borrowed from the central bank at the
height of the financial crisis in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, South Korea borrowed a rescue loan of 58
billion dollars from the International Monetary Fund after it
suffered a financial crisis caused by corporate failures and bad
loans of financial institutions in late 1997 when its foreign
currency reserves stood at 3.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since Kim Dae-jung became South Korean president in February
1998, the nation has increased exports and reduced imports while
reforming industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's foreign currency reserves have kept on
rising to 60 billion dollars at the end of June and then to 66.21
billion at the end of last month.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's Remarks Against Will of Taiwanese People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee has been trying to shake the realistic basis of one China
by agitating confrontations among different ethnic groups in the
island province, interfere with efforts to opening the "three
direct services" by adopting the cross-straits policy of "
refraining from hastiness" and revise school textbooks, the
commentary says. All these run against the will of the people of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee's separatist views are an attempt to forge a "new Taiwanese
consciousness", claiming that the interests of the Taiwan people
should be with Taiwan, not China.
</P>
<P>
Under Lee's government, "black money politics" has been rampant
in the island province, while his cross-straits policies have been
detrimental to the interests of the Taiwanese people.
</P>
<P>
Since the Sept. 21 earthquake, the Taiwan Authorities have
turned a blind eye to the needs and requests of earthquake victims
by blocking the entry of rescue personnel and goods from the
mainland, and giving a lukewarm reception to a rescue team from
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
The commentary goes on to note that during Lee's inspection of
earthquake-hit areas, Lee's helicopter blew down a big tree that
killed a girl and overturned the tents of earthquake victims. The
commentary ridicules Lee's quarrel with one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Lee's proposal to donate 300 million U.S. dollars to Kosovo was
widely opposed in Taiwan, but he became angry when some victims
asked to allocate the money for devastated earthquake areas, the
commentary says.

<HEADLINE> OIC Members Urged to Invest in Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Rafiq
Tarar Tuesday asked the countries of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) to invest in science and technology for a
strong scientific base for the progress and prosperity of the
Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural ceremony of the Ninth General Assembly
meeting of the OIC Standing Committee on Scientific and
Technological Cooperation (COMSTECH) here, Tarar asked Muslim
scientists and scholars to use their insight and intellect to
integrate modern sciences with the indigenous cultures and
traditions of the Muslim society.
</P>
<P>
The dawn of the new millennium, he said, will bring with it new
challenges which will certainly require fresh commitments and firm
determination to achieve the organization's goals.
</P>
<P>
"As we enter the 21st century the developing world is faced
with the challenge of achieving self-reliance and economic
prosperity," Tarar said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Muslim countries to join hands and make this
gathering a memorable and historical turning point by providing
COMSTECH with adequate financial backing which it genuinely needs.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan firmly believes that a true revival of science in the
Muslim world can only be achieved when Islam permeates in our
entire life and social environment," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tarar hoped that the participants' deliberations will lead to
tangible and concrete strategies for the promotion of science and
technology in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
"The major challenge facing us today is the dire need for
socioeconomic development. This development has to have its roots
in the social, cultural and economic fabric of a given society and
have to be truly need-oriented and geared to our national economic
scenario," he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that OIC member countries will benefit from the new
initiatives of COMSTECH and appreciate the new role of the
organization of actively conducting science and technology
programs instead of confining itself to an advisory role.
</P>
<P>
The COMSTECH, a major scientific forum of the OIC member
states, is being attended by the 32 OIC member countries.
</P>
<P>
Atta ur Rehman, coordination secretary for the conference, has
said the discussion will focus on chalking out strategies to
strengthen cooperation in science and technology among OIC member
states.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua)-- The American business community
here is "delighted" by the bilateral agreement which sees China's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), said Richard
Latham today, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in the
People's Republic of China (AmCham-China).
</P>
<P>
Latham's remarks represent the common feeling among American
business people in China after it was announced that China and the
United States had signed documents concerning China's entry into
the WTO on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We pledge our full support in the implementation process in
coming years", Richard said.

<P>
John Sullivan, vice-chairman of AmCham-China and a lawyer of
Baker &AMP; Mckenzie, said that AmCham members look forward to
studying the details of the agreement. The lawyer also said that
China's accession to the WTO will most likely see an increased
investment in China operations by U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies, especially those which have been conducting
business in China for a long time such as automobile,
telecommunications, and service trade industries, are most
concerned about what impact the agreement will have on their
companies.
</P>
<P>
General Motors, the biggest foreign investor in China, said in
a statement that "given the size of China's economy and its impact
on the world trading system, bringing China into the multilateral
trade order and the mainstream of the trading community is in
everyone's best interest."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of General Motors said that "the Buicks produced at
Shanghai GM are of world-class quality, and given the demand we
have seen for thus far, we fully expect to remain competitive
after China enters the WTO."

<HEADLINE> China Concerned about "Taipei-Tokyo Friendly City" Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China is concerned about the "
Friendly City" relationship between Taipei and Tokyo, which was
proposed by Tokyo Governor Ishihara Shintaro during his recent
trip to Taiwan, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said
today at a regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
The friendly relationship between Beijing and Tokyo is based
upon the Sino-Japanese Joint Communique and the Treaty of Peace
and Friendship between China and Japan, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental purpose of Ishihara's claim that Tokyo and
Taipei would form a "friendly city" relationship, Sun said, is an
attempt to destroy the political basis of the already-existing
friendship between Beijing and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara's proposal constitutes a potentially serious political
situation and bring great damage upon the friendship between
Beijing and Tokyo and between China and Japan, he said, adding
that China will continue to pay close attention to the development
of the situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China's largest auction house
set a sales record in the last three years of 67.5 million yuan (8.
13 million U.S. dollars) at its autumn auctions.
</P>
<P>
Kou Qin, vice-president of China Guardian Auctions Co. Ltd.,
said that most of the auctioneers never anticipated record auction
sales of this kind.
</P>
<P>
Kou is especially happy with the auction of 20th century
Chinese fine arts works.
</P>
<P>
"Red Mountains in Autumn," by landscape painter Li Keran (1907-
89) sold for 4.07 million yuan, a figure rarely seen at auctions
for Chinese paintings.
</P>
<P>
Wu Guanzhong's oil painting "Red Lotus" sold for 1.32 million
yuan. Chen Yifei's "Real Love", sold for 660,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to Kou, "Guardian" wants to review major developments
in the history of Chinese painting.
</P>
<P>
"Guardian" has made huge profits selling antique chinaware. A
flat vase made during the early Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) was
auctioned for 4.19 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The auctioning of the world's oldest alcohol attracted
collectors from all over the world. The spirit sold for 3.5
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Collection markets have been influenced by the Asian economic
crisis. "Guardian" sold its collection for 51.53 million yuan at
large-scale auctions in spring this year.
</P>
<P>
"We might see a similar wave of auction buying in the future",
said Wang Yannan, "Guardian's" president.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ruling Party Provisionally Wins Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Election Commission
declared on Tuesday that the ruling party candidate had
provisionally won the by-election to the parliament in the
northwestern Tangail district, which was held on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shawkat Momen Shahjahan of the ruling Awami League (AL) won the
polls by securing 75,975 votes, defeating his nearest rival,
independent candidate Abdul Kader Siddiqui, who received more than
60,148 votes from 78 of the 82 polling centers.
</P>
<P>
Polling in the remaining four polling centers was suspended on
Monday by the Election Commission due to violence and alleged
rigging, but Shahjahan was declared elected unofficially as the
total 13,452 votes of the four centers would not affect the result
after re-polling.
</P>
<P>
The by-election bore special significance both to the
government and Siddiqui, an expelled AL leader, political
observers here said.
</P>
<P>
For the government, it was a test of its popularity amid
escalating confrontation with the opposition, and for Siddiqui, it
would mean life or death of his political life, they said.
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui, who resigned from the parliament after he was
dispelled from the party for "violating party discipline" earlier
this year, had rejected the election, saying massive rigging was
done by the ruling party, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
"I will not accept the result whether I win or lose," he was
quoted as saying, adding that he could not even cast his own vote
as it was cast by somebody else before he went to the polling
station.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two candidates were in the race for the parliament seat,
but Shahjahan and Siddiqui were the major contenders.
</P>
<P>
The seat fell vacant on August 29 when Siddiqui quit the
parliament after he was dispelled from the party, apparently
because of a row with AL President and Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina.
</P>
<P>
Major opposition parties, such as the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Jatiya Party, boycotted the
election.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Defense Ministry
said Tuesday that government troops had killed 13 Tamil rebels in
the latest fighting, but preparations for next month's
presidential election continued with the receiving of 13
nominations.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that government troops on
Monday killed 12 rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) in three separate incidents in the northern Wanni region.
</P>
<P>
One more LTTE rebel was killed on Monday in the northernmost
Jaffna region, the former stronghold of LTTE rebels who have been
fighting a 16-year-old war for a separate state for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, government troops had suffered one of their
worst debacles in its fight against the separatist LTTE rebels in
the Wanni region by losing at least 10 strategic towns and a large
swath of land.
</P>
<P>
Speculation was rife that President Chandrika Kumaratunga might
postpone the presidential election scheduled for December 21 as
the military debacle could harm her hope of re-election.
</P>
<P>
However, the arrangements for the election were under way as
nominations were received Tuesday morning from 13 candidates for
the forthcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Acting Commissioner of Elections P.B. Dassanayake said he
received nomination papers from 10 candidates of recognized
parties and three independent candidates.
</P>
<P>
About 11.8 million voters are expected to vote at 9,897 polling
stations between 7:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on December 21 to elect a
new president, he said.
</P>
<P>
The main contenders are widely believed to the incumbent
Kumaratunga and her major rival Ranil Wickremesinghe, leader of

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat said Tuesday that the Palestinian side should be consulted
on the Israeli withdrawal maps.
</P>
<P>
In response to Israel's assertions that the Israeli side alone
will make decisions on the maps of Israeli troop withdrawal from
the West Bank, Erekat said that the Sharm El Sheikh memorandum
signed in September stipulated joint approval of the maps.
</P>
<P>
In a statement broadcast Tuesday morning by the Voice of
Palestine radio, Erekat said the two sides will meet in the day to
iron out differences over what areas of the West Bank are to be
turned over to the Palestinians, which delayed the second-stage
Israeli troops withdrawal from the West Bank scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
Erekat will also meet U.S. Middle East Special Coordinator
Dennis Ross in search for a solution to the issue in the day.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Erekat had met with Ross
separately Monday to discuss the maps which Arafat had refused to
endorse. The Palestinian side demanded the transfer of areas more
densely populated than Israel had proposed.
</P>
<P>
During the planned second stage 5 percent land transfer, 2
percent of West Bank land will be turned from joint into full
Palestinian control and 3 percent from sole Israeli rule to
Palestinian civil administration.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Hails Commonwealth's Rejection to Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has welcomed a Commonwealth communique, in which the
Commonwealth rejected the Turkish Cypriot side's demand for
recognition of its breakaway regime in the north.
</P>
<P>
Clerides voiced his appreciation in South Africa before leaving
for Istanbul Monday night to attend a summit of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe there on Thursday and
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Local mass media reported on Tuesday that the Commonwealth
leaders in a final communique issued after their meeting in
Durban, South Africa, urged the implementation of U.N. Security
Council resolutions that calls for direct talks between the two
rival sides on the island based on a bi-communal federation formula.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also called for the withdrawal of Turkish troops
and settlers from the island, the return of refugees to their
homes and an account of missing persons.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased the Cyprus extract notes that the solution of the
Cyprus question should include the return of the refugees to their
homes and the accounting for all missing persons," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has sent an invitation to
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides for "proximity talks" in New
York on December 3, for a comprehensive settlement on the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash have accepted
the invitation.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel has asked the U.S. to
reduce its anti-terror information and technology aid to the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) for fear such information or
technology could be passed from PNA to terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
Israeli daily Haaretz Tuesday quoted a government source as
saying that Israeli officials have recently discussed the issue
with senior U.S. officials and expressed their concerns about the
risk that sensitive information on anti-terror methods and
technology would be passed from PNA to some terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
"The American aid to the Palestinians carries a great danger,
because it's impossible to know exactly what the Palestinians are
receiving or who ultimately receives it. Terrorists can learn the
methods that are employed against them and could use them to
devise counter-measures," the source said.
</P>
<P>
"The mistake was the insertion of the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) into the relations between us and the
Palestinians. Now it is too late to stop the aid entirely. It is
only possible to try and reduce the damage." the source added.
</P>
<P>
The American government has promised to take Israel's concerns
into consideration and to examine the aid plan that the CIA is
providing to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The CIA got involved in the Israeli-Palestinian security
cooperation during Benjamin Netanyahu's regime from 1996 to 1999
when PNA froze its cooperation on security matters with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye River peace deal signed by Israel and the
Palestinians in October last year, the CIA was entrusted with
supervising PNA's anti-terror efforts, while CIA's Tel Aviv
station was authorized to monitor PNA's detaining of suspected
terrorists, assist the PNA in collecting illegal weapons, and set
up a tripartite monitoring committee that was to meet weekly.
</P>
<P>
Upon his election as Prime Minister in May, Ehud Barak
reportedly expressed his opposition to the CIA's involvement and
asked the U.S. to reduce CIA's role.

<HEADLINE> UN Team in Afghan Capital to Seek Safety Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. team arrived in the
Afghan capital of Kabul Tuesday to secure safety guarantees from
the Taliban after various attacks on the U.N. offices in major
Afghan cities over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. coordinator for Afghanistan, Erick de Mul, told the
media upon his arrival that he would meet senior Taliban officials
and establish contacts with the militia, according to a report
reaching here from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Several U.N. buildings across Afghanistan were attacked with
stones and one office in Fahar, in the south, was torched by angry
crowds on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of protesters have been demonstrating against U.N.
sanctions imposed on Afghanistan on Sunday because the Taliban
refused to hand over alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden has been charged in the United States with the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August
last year in which 224 people died.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution on October 15,
giving the Taliban 30 days to hand over Osama. Otherwise sanctions
would be imposed on the Taliban.

items in leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States agreed on Monday to the adhesion of China
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) after 13 years of talks. The
global trade organization would no longer miss more than one
billion people who represent the greatest market of the world
today. China is yet to negotiate with the European Union (EU) for
its entry into the WTO. EU said it would ask for similar
advantages from China as those obtained by the United States.
</P>
<P>
-- Britain proposed on Monday that the European Union could
mobilize a rapid reaction force consisting of from 100,000 to 150,
000 soldiers to ensure missions of crisis management Kosovo style.
London also proposed to its EU partners that they build the
capacity to deploy 50,000 men in 60 days and if necessary,
maintain a peacekeeping force for two years.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- After six days of intensive negotiations, the United States
signed on Monday an agreement with China lifting the block placed
by Washington to the entry of Beijing into the World Trade
Organization (WTO). The agreement has a historical meaning as it
strengthened the policy of reform and opening made by Deng
Xiaoping. China has agreed to open the strategic markets of
finance and agriculture in the agreement, while rejecting some U.S.
demands.
</P>
<P>
-- The telescope of Greg Henry, an astronomer of the University
of Tennessee in the United States, has become the first to capture

HANGZHOU, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Local sources have confirmed
that at least eight people have been killed in a landslide in
Hangzhou of east China's Zhejiang Province on November 13.
</P>
<P>
The landslide destroyed an apartment block in the town of
Weiping, Chunan County burying 11 people. Rescuers dug out the
victims 34 hours later. Seven were found dead. Another died later
in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Local officials previously warned that a crag right behind the
apartment block might fall down after they found numerous cracks
in it. Most of the residents were evacuated on November 12, but
the 11 who were buried were skeptical about a pending disaster and
refused to move out.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the landslide was likely caused by the loose
soil in the autumn climate.

<HEADLINE> French Traders Eager to Do Business With Iraq: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A French diplomat in Baghdad
has said that the trade ties between France and Iraq will witness
a noticeable progress in all domains, an Iraqi newspaper reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The participation of 130 trade and industrial French firms
in the Baghdad International Fair mirrors France's desire to
further develop its trade with Iraq," Head of the French
Interests Section in Baghdad Andrea Jaier was quoted by the
Baghdad Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jaier said that the high level of French participation in the
fair signaled three trends.
</P>
<P>
"It shows Iraq's return to the regional trade scene... It
shows French firms have understood that the Iraqi market is
increasingly competitive and proves French traders have
appreciated the interests of the Iraqi markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said French firms "are keen to open for-food program
as a number of French firms provided Iraq with foodstuffs,
medicine, equipment, spare parts for electricity and oil sectors.
</P>
<P>
"A number of French firms have signed deals to modernize
Iraq's communications system," said the French diplomat, adding
those deals are awaiting approval of the U.N. Sanctions
Committee.
</P>
<P>
All the contracts Iraq signed with foreign companies under
the oil-for-food deal must obtain approval from the Sanctions
Committee before any shipment can be made.
</P>
<P>
"The French government is endeavoring to have the deals
approved, yet the (sanctions) committee insists that the materials
 and equipment included in the deal are of a dual-usage," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The 32nd Baghdad International Fair which concluded six days
ago drew a record attendance of 950 companies from 36
countries. Iraq sees the turnout as much an occasion to do
business as a sign of normalization with those countries that
participated in the fair.
</P>
<P>
France has presented a proposal to the U.N. Security
Council calling for all sanctions on Iraq to be lifted for
renewable periods of 100 days once a new weapons monitoring
regime is in place in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the French proposal has faced opposition from the
United States and Britain which only agree to a limited and
conditional suspension of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council recently has focused its discussion on
a British-Dutch proposal which recommends a conditional suspension
of sanctions on Iraq if Baghdad agrees to allow an enlarged
weapons inspection body to return and put its oil revenues
under the U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990, which triggered the 1991 Gulf War.

SEOUL -- The U.S. Forces Korea sprayed more than 21,000 gallons
of toxic defoliants in 1968-1969 along the south of the
Demilitarized Zone, South Korean media reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
None of some 7,000 South Korean soldiers knew they were
spraying three kinds of toxic materials -- Agent Orange, Agent
Blue and Monuron, and they were not given any warnings, masks or
proper protective gears, the media reports said, quoting a
declassified document of the U.S. Department of the Army. The
document said that under the "Vegetation Control Program 1968,"
the toxic defoliants were sprayed in the area some 100 meters wide
and 155 miles long along the south of buffer zone to "deny hostile
forces the concealment provided by vegetation." (SKorea-US-

<HEADLINE> HK Information Technology Ready for New Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Information Technology
Services Department (ITSD) of Hong Kong will continue to be
committed to promoting the wider use of information technology (IT)
in government and community in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the "Electronic Government
in the New Millennium" conference marking the 10th anniversary of
ITSD Tuesday, Director of Information Technology Services Lau Kam-
hung said the importance of IT to government and society has
increased enormously in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
"It is very encouraging for us as a department to look back on
a number of cases in which other departments, with our help, have
achieved the targets which they had set for themselves," Lau said.
</P>
<P>
Lau said ITSD aimed at developing an integrated government-wide
infrastructure to cope with department needs on a united and
integrated platform.
</P>
<P>
The key to this has been the building of a network
infrastructure, connecting all bureaus and departments, onto which
has been added an electronic messaging facility for both internal
communication and communication with the public.
</P>
<P>
Lau said that from the public's point of view, what would
certainly be the most dramatic development in the department's
work in the next decade would be the use of IT to allow electronic
service delivery or ESD.
</P>
<P>
The ESD scheme, to be implemented next year, will streamline
many transactions by allowing members of the public to transact
business with government departments and public agencies through
electronic means at places and time convenient to them.
</P>
<P>
In the coming decade, ITSD will gain a whole new set of clients
because the department has been charged with promoting the use of
IT in the community.
</P>
<P>
ITSD was re-organized from the Government Data Processing
Agency in 1989. It has been ITSD's tasks to help government
departments to survey and analyze their activities, identify areas
where IT can bring significant improvements and formulate plans
which allow its clients to keep up their service standards while
introducing new ways to carry out their work.

<P>
ANKARA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 547 people were
killed and 3,299 others injured in a 7.2-magnitude earthquake,
which jolted northwestern Turkey on Friday, the Crisis Center of
the Prime Ministry announced here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The center said that over 10,000 people have been working hard

</P>
<P>
A total of 715 buildings were destroyed in the killer quake

ground could once again shake around them.
</P>
<P>
The life for the residents in Duzce is growing more and more
difficult with adverse weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Without enough tents to go around, many people in Duzce had to
spend the last four nights sleeping outside amid sub-freezing
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
On August 17, a 7.4-magnitude quake hit western Turkey,
killing at least 17,000 people, injuring over 40,000 others and

<HEADLINE> Jordanian House Demands Safety Proof for U.S. Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian House of
Representatives (lower house of parliament) has asked the
government to submit all documents regarding the safety of a
disputed U.S. wheat shipment to the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Speaker of the lower house Bassam Haddadin made the
request on Monday amid reports that the 47.5 tons of U.S. wheat,
which arrived in the southern port city of Aqaba in late October,
had been contaminated by toxic fungi as dead animals were found in
the ship's hull, the semi-official Jordan Times newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move coincided with demands by the Jordanian Consumer
Protection Society to file an urgent lawsuit to halt the
distribution of the U.S. wheat unless a court decides that it is
safe.
</P>
<P>
The society believed that the wheat was polluted and it failed
to meet health standards as the shipment was purified with a
substance to eliminate any remnants of rodents and insects.
</P>
<P>
The ship used to transport the wheat was rented by the
Jordanian embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
However, the government said it had all documents to prove
that the wheat shipment is safe for human consumption, and it was
willing to submit the documents and thorough explanation to the
House.
</P>
<P>
The wheat is now stockpiled in a grain mill in Juwedah, a town
15 kilometers south of Amman.
</P>
<P>
The shipment is part of the wheat donations worth 15 million
U.S. dollars promised by the United States to Jordan for the
year 1999.
</P>
<P>
Washington has provided some 270 million dollars in military
and economic assistance to the kingdom in the fiscal year ending
on September 30 to reward its role in promoting the Middle East
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Incoming Proximity Talks Draw Concerns in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Political parties in Cyprus
have expressed concerns over the government's acceptance of the
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's invitation to talks in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides Sunday accepted the
invitation to attend "proximity talks" in New York on December 3
with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, for a settlement to
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The direct peace talks between the two sides have been
deadlocked since 1997 and the Turkish Cypriots have demanded
recognition of their self-proclaimed republic in northern Cyprus
before resumption of the negotiations, a request rejected by the
Cypriot government and world community.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Democratic Party leader Spyros Kyprianou Monday said
that the offer was "unacceptable," accusing Annan of changing the
invitation's format.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Annan, in his statement on the invitations,
referred Clerides as president, but after complaints by Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, the secretary general immediately
removed the "president" and then Denktash agreed to the talks.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition AKEL party said that instead of
negotiations in the framework of U.N. resolutions, "we have become
the martyrs of artificial scenarios that will bring about an
artificial progress that in turn will be used to assist Turkey's
passage into the European Union."
</P>
<P>
The first Vice-President of the socialist EDEK party Yiannakis
Omirou said Clerides' acceptance had been a "diplomatic and
political defeat."
</P>
<P>
Omirou, the former defense minister, noted that Clerides had
committed himself to the National Council not to accept an
invitation to talks based on Denktash's demands.
</P>
<P>
He said the move would force Cyprus to support Turkey's
accession if nothing other than as a sign of good will.
</P>
<P>
Prodromos Prodromou, a deputy of ruling Democratic Rally
party, said the issue could be seen as a quick fix in Turkey's
favor.

<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Anshan Iron and Steel
Complex, one of China's largest state-owned enterprises in the
iron and steel industry in Liaoning Province, signed a significant
debt-to-equity swap agreement today with its creditors.
</P>
<P>
Involving as much as 6.854 billion yuan (about 870 million U.S.
dollars), the agreement is the largest so far signed between SOEs
and four newly established asset management corporations.
</P>
<P>
Headed by the China Huarong Asset Management Corporation, the
creditors include the China Development Bank, the China Cinda
Asset Management Corporation and the China Oriental Asset

Equipped with advanced technologies and modern facilities,
Anshan Iron and Steel Complex has an output capacity of nine
million tons of pig iron, 8.8 million tons of steel and 6.8
million tons of rolled steel annually.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Huarong Asset Management Corporation said when
the debt-swap agreement is implemented, the creditors and the
enterprise will organize a new company, with Huarong holding
shares valued at five billion yuan and the other creditors holding
part of its shares.
</P>
<P>
The liability rate of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex will be
lowered from 71 percent to 40 percent, cutting annual interest
expenditures by nearly 500 million yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua)-- Despite a sharp downfall in
bilateral trade this year, Chinese and Indian economic officials
and businessmen vowed to strengthen trade links at a symposium
today.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Zhou Keren, Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, highlighted the development of economic
relations between the two Asian neighbors since they established
diplomatic ties in 1950.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou, India is now China's 8th biggest trade
partner in Asia, with bilateral trade volume growing at an yearly
average rate of 30 percent in the 1990s. Bilateral trade reached 1.
92 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, despite the crushing financial
crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Indian trade officials present at the seminar said
that the first 6 months of 1999 saw Indian exports to China drop
by 28.3 percent, bringing bilateral trade to drop 11.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Indian officials and businessmen gave in-depth introductions to
the economic situation in India, foreign trade and investment,
while business representatives from Chinese enterprises told
stories of their investment and trade successes in India.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has set
three preconditions for financing Bangladesh's power sector, The
Bangladesh Observer reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The conditions included issuing a public statement on the power
sector's reform policy, proper administrative measures to
accelerate the reform process and a short-term action plan to
improve the revenue collection of the Power Development Board
(PDB) and the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority.
</P>
<P>
The conditions were listed in an "Aide Memoire" which the WB
handed over to Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria on November 2.
The "Aide Memoire" had been prepared on the basis of discussions
between the government and the WB's special mission on the power
sector, which visited Dhaka last month.
</P>
<P>
The "Aide Memoire" said it was vital for the government to
articulate its strategy on reform through a clear policy
statement, which should be made public, and the finance minister
had endorsed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 15 percent of the country's total population
of more than 126 million have access to electricity, and the
present capacity of the PDB is only about 2,290 megawatts of
power.

<HEADLINE> Economist Says China's Accession to WTO Will Inspire Financial Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 16 (Xinhua)-- China's accession to the WTO (
World Trade Organization) will inspire the long term finance
development of the country, said Dr. Pei Ping, dean of the Finance
Department of the Nanjing University, east China's Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral agreement signed by China and the US concerning
China's entry into the WTO on November 15 will benefit both China
and the US and exert a positive influence on the world economy as
well, Pei told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The large amount of capital expected to be brought by foreign
organizations in the wake of the China's entry into the WTO will
undoubtedly increase China's capacity in financing and rational
utility of foreign investment, Pei said.
</P>
<P>
The fierce competition in the economic sector inspired by China
's entry into the WTO will require China to further improve its
services and readjust its financial structure and operational
system, said Pei.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral agreement on the WTO issue between China and the
US has admittedly attracted enormous interest around the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has said the ruling People's Alliance (PA) will never
allow the country to be divided by giving a separate state to the
Tamil rebels, press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News said the president reiterated her
position on Sunday when addressing an election rally at Wariyapola
in North Western Province, about 120 km northeast of the capital
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said she would never betray the country or destroy
its sovereignty though opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe
wanted to become president by any means.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said her efforts to hold dialogue with the rebels
and arrive at a solution had failed as the rebels had reneged on
the promise of truce and dragged the government to war.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader's plan to stop the war and bring about
peace would be to give rebel leader Prabhakaran his much coveted
separate state of Eelam in Sri Lanka's north and east, she said.
</P>
<P>
While any national leader would forget petty political
differences and come forward to work to save the country, the
present opposition leader has dragged his feet over the
government's peace proposals of devolution for five years,
blocking its implementation, she said.
</P>
<P>
She challenged the opposition leader to divulge his peace plans
which were apparently acceptable to the rebels whose sole demand
was a separate state.
</P>
<P>
The PA has a realistic solution but the opposition does not
support it, said Kumaratunga, adding that the upcoming
presidential election on December 21 will somehow pave the way for
the government to implement its proposals.

<HEADLINE> Maize Yield Set to Drop in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan farmers are expected to
harvest 1.8 million tons of maize this year, far below the
1991-19alley Province in western Kenya, which normally produces
the largest quantity of the crop, will harvest 900,000 tons of the
national output.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper noted that the unseasonable rainfall had hampered
 harvesting of the crop in the main producing districts of Uasin
Gishu and Trans Nzoia in Rift Valley Province, leading to local
crop losses.
</P>
<P>
Despite the onset of the 1999/2000 short-rain season, whose
output accounts for an estimated 15 percent of the national annual
maize output, the uncharacteristic absence of rainfall in the
drought-prone and rain- dependent marginal agricultural districts
has also delayed planting.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Companies Warned to License Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November (Xinhua) -- Lebanese companies have been
warned by an international software umbrella group to license
their software or face criminal and civil lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
"This is the last warning before international software
companies start throwing the book at offenders," said Ashok
Sharma, director of the Business Software Alliance (BSA) in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The BSA is an independent organization that looks after the
interest of software companies around the world. Its members
include Microsoft, Novell and Adobe, the Daily Star reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The BSA has sent warning letters to about 10,000 Lebanese
companies, including banks, since the copyright law went into
effect in Lebanon in June.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanese companies have purposely chosen to ignore warnings,
so now they must face the consequences," Sharma said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the banks of being the worst offenders, saying they
advertise profits in millions of dollars in newspapers, but when
it comes to paying a few thousand dollars to license software they
balk at the proposition.
</P>
<P>
He said major software companies have joined forces in
preparing cases against unlicensed software in the business sector.
</P>
<P>
According to Lebanese copyright law, offenders can face prison
terms ranging from one month to three years, in addition to
fines ranging from 3,300 U.S. dollars to 33,155 dollars.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Hail Sino-U.S. Accord on WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-U.S. agreement on
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) represents a
milestone in China's political and economic development, Ming Pao,
one of the major dailies in Hong Kong, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move will enable the Chinese economy to further integrate
with that of the world, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper South China Morning Post described the
agreement "historic," saying it will pave the way for China to
join the world's principal trade body.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Standard, another English daily here, said, "The
benefits will be far-reaching -- enough to take China from a byway
onto the superhighway to becoming a modern state."
</P>
<P>
The accord, signed Monday after 13 years of hard bargaining,
will virtually end the decade-old annual debates in the U.S.
Congress on China's trade status, the paper said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Trade Development Council also expressed welcome
to the agreement, which it said "would hasten China's accession to
the World Trade Organization."
</P>
<P>
As the mainland is the largest trading partner of Hong Kong,
"China's WTO entry will usher in a new era of growth and dynamism
for Hong Kong," Victor K. Fung, chairman of the council, said in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
China's interior trade with Hong Kong totaled 133.8 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998, accounting for 38 percent of Hong Kong's total
external trade.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economic success is to a significant extent a
result of China's economic reforms and opening up, the council
said.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement pushed Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang
Seng Index 372.55 points, or 2.62 percent up to close at 14,562.22
Monday, the highest level since October 8, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Tighten Control on Egyptian Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has decided to tighten
control on Egyptian workers seeking jobs in the kingdom, the
Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Besides approval by the Egyptian authorities, Egyptian workers
who intend to seek jobs in Jordan will have to get approval and
work permits from the Jordanian ministries of labor and foreign
affairs, Jordanian Minister of Labor Eid Fayez said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fayez came to Cairo on Monday and briefed the Egyptian side on
the decision during a meeting with Egyptian Prime Minister Atef
Obeid, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's steps are aimed at "protecting the interests of the
Egyptian workers" and ensure that "they are qualified for their
jobs," Fayez said after his meeting with Obeid.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian decision, which the newspaper said was prompted
by a recent street rioting in Kuwait involving Egyptian workers
there, was taken to fend off possible disputes.
</P>
<P>
On October 30, a quarrel between an Egyptian worker and a
Bengalese shop assistant led to a violent clash involving
thousands of Egyptian and Bengalese expatriate workers in the
southern suburb of Kuwait City. It was believed to be the most
serious rioting in the history of the Gulf sheikdom.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Labor Ahmed el-Amawi, who attended the
meeting, said Egypt respected Jordan's decision and would take
measures to restrict the flow of workers into the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics estimate that 300,000 out of 3 million
Egyptian expatriates are working in Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Asian PC Market Continues to Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Total PC shipments in Asia-
Pacific, excluding Japan, reached over 3.6 million units in the
third quater of this year, the highest in four years, a U.S.
market research firm reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding PC growth was consistent throughout the region,
said a report from International Data Corporation (IDC), despite
earlier concerns that end-user apprehension regarding the Y2K
issue would impede the market.
</P>
<P>
Asia's economic recovery remains the primary factor behind the
regional market's momentum as PC demand picked up in all countries,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Competitively, China's Legend is expected to lead the regional
market for the first time with 8.5 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
Legend's regional market coverage remained limited to China,
the largest market in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan. Holding the
crown ranking in China enabled Legend to claim the region's top
spot. Aggressive pricing and its influence in China's burgeoning
consumer PC market also contributed to the vendor's growth.
</P>
<P>
As a result of Legend's gains, IBM dropped to the second place
with a roughly 7.8 percent market share, followed by Compaq,
Hewlett-Packard and Samsung, said the report.

LUSAKA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union will
contribute 1.2 million Euros (3.8 million U.S. dollars) to the
implementation of the Lusaka cease-fire agreement and the peace
process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Embassy of Finland in Lusaka, Zambia,
Monday said that the money was intended to cover part of
operational and non- military expenditure of the Joint Military
Commission (JMC) set up under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Tuesday quoted the press release as
saying the EU's support would enable the JMC to deploy its
observers in the DRC for six months.
</P>
<P>
The EU has previously contributed 2.65 million Euros (8.41
million dollars) to the mediation process in the DRC conflict
through the Southern African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
Leo Olasvirta, charge d' affaires of the Finnish Embassy, whose
country holds the current EU presidency, said EU considered the
Lusaka agreement signed earlier this year by all parties involved
in the conflict as crucial for the restoration of peace and
stability in the DRC and the entire Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The function of the JMC is to verify and monitor the
cease-fire, including verification of all information and

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Agreement Receives Positive Responses in Shanghai (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The bilateral agreement just
signed between China and the United States on China's accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) has received positive responses
in Shanghai, China's leading metropolis. Local entrepreneurs and
experts say that entry into the WTO will give Shanghai new
opportunities and challenges.
</P>
<P>
"We have paid particular attention to the Sino-U.S.
negotiations because the outcome will relate directly to our
future development," said Wang Yang, president of the Orient
International (Holding) Co., Ltd., a state-owned foreign trade
company.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that China's accession to the WTO will greatly prompt
Chinese enterprises to operate further according to international
practices and sharpening China's competitive edge in the global
market.
</P>
<P>
Wang's company, mainly engaged in the textile trade, has become
one of China's largest enterprises by implementing a series of
reforms over the past few years. The company generated more than 1.
39 billion U.S. dollars in exports during the first ten months of
this year, up 4.28 percent on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang said, the company's export was affected by the
Asian financial crisis. Forty percent of the comapny's export
commodities were the same as those in Southeast Asian countries
whose products gained competitiveness amid the wave of local
currency devaluations.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that Chinese enterprises are still faced with
the task of improving product quality and increasing the added
value of their products even if China enters the WTO and quotas
are removed," Wang said.

<P>
Zhao Xiaoding, vice chairman of the Shanghai Lansheng (Group)
Corp., whose stocks gained more than 0.4 yuan per share yesterday
due to the Sino-U.S. WTO deal, said that China's accession to the
WTO will provide a wider channel for Chinese enterprises such as
Lansheng to compete directly in the global market. More overseas
enterprises, including foreign trade companies will come to China,
increasing competition with Chinese counterparts, said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
"Only by competing in the international market with courage and
determination will Chinese enterprises be able to survive in the
global economy," Zhao added.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yaotian, director of the WTO Shanghai Research Center,
China's first institution specializing in WTO research, said that
China's entry into the WTO will benefit the country in nine areas:
introduction of overseas investment, export, reform of state-owned
enterprises, increase of domestic demand, creation of jobs,
raising of living standards, resolving the Taiwan issue,
prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao, and thriving on the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
Director Wang became engaged in research into the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947 when he was studying
for a doctorate at Columbia University in the United States. He
has since published over 20 books on the GATT and the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"China's accession to the WTO will act as a key driving force
to the continuing opening and sustainable development of the
country in the coming century," the director said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Youwen, a research fellow of the Institute of World
Economy under the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said that
Shanghai will probably become one of the first cities to make a
smooth transition to WTO membership operation.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Shanghai now has some 19,000
overseas-funded businesses, with a total contractual overseas
investment of 34.93 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year the city achieved 31.34 billion U.S. dollars in
imports and exports. This figure is expected to reach 55 billion
in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's goal is to become an international trade center,
attracting more overseas capital, while adopting advanced
international quality standards in local enterprises.

HOHHOT, November 16 (Xinhua) -- More than one million farmers
and herdsmen in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
have been provided with running water thanks to efforts of the

<P>
For a long time, people and livestock living in rural and

To solve the problem, the local government initiated a water
supply project in 1996 aiming to provide drinking water for the 3.
8 million people and 10 million livestock in dry areas.
</P>

Over the past four years, Inner Mongolia has invested 280
million yuan (33.7 million U.S. dollars) to build 472 pumping
stations in counties and villages and install thousands of pipes
and taps for the farmers and herdsmen.
</P>

At present, 1.37 million farmers and herdsmen in 483 counties

<HEADLINE> China To Resume Rice Futures Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China is considering resuming
its futures trading of polished long-grained nonglutinous rice at
the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide market survey and feasibility study is now
underway.
</P>
<P>
China launched futures markets in the early 1990s in the
absence of a complete legal framework. The number of exchanges
reached 60, with the number of commodities traded falling just
below 50.
</P>
<P>
Rampant speculation pushed the prices of some futures contracts
to irrational levels and contributed to inflation in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
The country took drastic measures to standardize the futures
market last year, reducing the number of futures exchanges in
China to three: The Shanghai Futures Exchange, The Dalian Futures
Exchange and The Zhengzhou Futures Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Pudong New Area, an emerging financial and trade
zone in Shanghai, the Shanghai Futures Exchange has a 1,600-sq.m.
trading hall, with 233 members.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australia Hails Sino-US Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The historic trade deal
signed by China and the United States on Monday, which will pave
the way for China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
was highly commended by the Australian government and media.
</P>
<P>
Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile said in a statement that
he was delighted at the news, adding that Australia had been a
vigorous and enthusiastic supporter of China's WTO accession.
</P>
<P>
He said the pact will also lead to the promotion of trade ties
between Australia and China.
</P>
<P>
The Australian said the completion of the current round of
talks with the United States paves the way for China to conclude
other agreements necessary to secure its accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an analyst as saying that membership of
the WTO is essential for countries who want to globalize their
economies.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review said that with Australia-China
two-way trade now worth 10 billion Australian dollars (6.6 billion
U.S. dollars), the accession is expected to boost the trade
further.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that although China has yet to finalize
agreements with the European Union and Canada, the bilateral deal
with the United States is widely regarded as the major
breakthrough to its entry.
</P>
<P>
In another article titled "Small Step a Giant Stride for World
Trade", the newspaper said that while it is a trade deal between
the world's biggest and fourth-biggest trading powers, its
implication is beyond a deal.
</P>
<P>
That is not only good for China, the newspaper said. It is also
good for the world trading system.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Shuttlers Set For China Open to Improve Rankings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) was sending athletes to compete in the China
Open to improve its shuttlers world rankings to enable them to
qualify for the Grand Prix Finals in Brunei Darussalam next month.
</P>
<P>
"The China Open will be the last tournament for our shuttlers
to improve their rankings. Hopefully, they won't lose to lower
ranked players in the championships," PBSI training director
Christian Hadinata said.
</P>
<P>
PBSI will send men's singles players Budi Santoso and Indra
Wijaya, women's singles player Ellen Angelina, men's doubles Denny
Kantono and Antonius, Sigit Budiarto and Halim Heryanto, women's
doubles Etty Tantri and Cynthia Tuwankotta, Elysa and Deyana
Lomban to the China Open in Beijing which starts on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Christian said he hoped Budi, ranked seventh in the world,
would reach, at least, the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
"We expect Budi, who is seeded third in the championships, to
reach the semi-finals. He is not allowed to lose to lower ranked
players or his ranking will decrease. The championships also serve
as a warm up for Budi, whose last tournament was the Indonesia
Open in August," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has qualified world number three Taufik Hidayat, Budi,
number eight Marlev Mainaky, number nine Hariyanto Arbi and number
11 Hendrawan in the Grand Prix Finals.
</P>
<P>
PBSI's official in charge of athletes development Mangombar
Ferdinand Siregar said he decided not to send Hendrawan because
the shuttler just competed in the Asia Cup in Ho Chi Minh City
where Indonesia brought home the crown.
</P>
<P>
Christian said men's doubles of Antonius and Denny, who are
ranked seventh in the world, must secure their place for the Grand
Prix Finals.
</P>
<P>
"In the finals doubles events, only eight best pairs in the
world qualify. Although Antonius and Denny are in seventh place,
they're not 100 percent sure to qualify. We are sending them to
the China Open to improve their ranking," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Sigit and Halim have a different task. They must make
spectacular performances in their tournaments to enable them to
qualify for the Olympics, especially Sigit who will play for the
first time after his suspension," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sigit was banned from competition for one year after he was
found guilty of consuming nandrolone after winning the Singapore
Open last year.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said the 1996 Olympic gold medalists Ricky Subagja and
Rexy Mainaky, whose world ranking was only 11, would fail to
perform in the Grand Prix Finals as PBSI was too late to register
them in the China Open.
</P>
<P>
In the women's doubles, Christian hoped Etty and Cynthia,
ranked ninth in the world, could improve their rankings to enable
them to compete in the Grand Prix Finals.
</P>
<P>
"We hope both Etty and Cynthia and also Elysa and Deyana, world
ranked 13, improve their world ranking to qualify not only for the
finals but also for the Olympics. They must reach, at least, the
semi-finals in the China Open," he added.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Tourism Board Looks to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Tourism
Board hopes to set up an office in Shanghai in a push to
capitalize on the potentially huge Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Board Chief Executive George Hickton said Tuesday in a
statement that he hopes to open the Shanghai office within a
couple of months.
</P>
<P>
The Board has boosted its marketing spending in China by nearly
60 percent to almost 400,000 NZ dollars (210,000 U.S. dollars)
after New Zealand was given approved destination status by the
Chinese Government this year, according to Hickton.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand and Australia were the first countries, outside
Asia, to gain the status to open the door to tourism with the
world's most populous country," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, New Zealand Tourism Minister
Lockwood Smith said the Chinese market is estimated to be worth 40
million NZ dollars (21 million U.S. dollars) to his country, with
about 17,000 visitor arrivals a year. He tipped this to grow to 60
million NZ dollars (31.2 million U.S. dollars) within three years.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Party Candidate Leading in Bangladeshi By-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The ruling party candidate
Shawkat Momen Shahjahan was leading the by-election to parliament
in northwestern Bangladesh's Tangail district, which was held on
Monday, Bangladesh Radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Shahjahan bagged more than 80,000 votes against his nearest
rival, independent candidate Abdul Kader Siddiqui, who received
over 60,000 votes from 78 of the 82 polling centers.
</P>
<P>
Polling in the remaining four polling centers were suspended on
Monday by the Election Commission due to violence and alleged
rigging, press reports said. Final results would not be available
until voting in the centers were resumed.
</P>
<P>
Some 216,650 voters were enlisted in the Tangail-8
constituency, about 80 km northwest of here, to cast their votes
to choose from among 32 candidates their representative in the
Jatiya Sangsad, the country's parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kader Siddiqui had rejected the election, saying massive
rigging was done by the ruling Awami League, The Independent daily
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
"I will not accept the result whether I win or lose," he was
quoted as saying, adding that he could not even cast his own vote
as it was cast by somebody else before he went to the polling
station.
</P>
<P>
A record 151 magistrates were sent to the constituency and a
3,500-strong force comprising the police, the army and the
Bangladesh Rifles (border forces) were deployed in the
constituency to ensure security during the polling hours.
</P>
<P>
Despite the tight security, the by-election was marked by
violence, intimidation, impersonated and multiple voting, police
firing and closure of polling stations, the Fair Election
Monitoring Alliance was quoted by The Independent as saying.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Bangladesh Rifles and police opened fire to
disperse warring supporters of rival candidates in the
constituency with at least one killed and 10 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The seat fell vacant on August 29 when Kader Siddiqui resigned
from the parliament after he was dispelled from the party for
"violating party discipline."
</P>
<P>
Major opposition parties, such as the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Jatiya Party, boycotted the
election.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) agreed to give Sri Lanka an 18.8 million U.S. dollar loan
for a skills development project to reduce the mismatch between
the unemployed and the demand for workers in some sectors.
</P>
<P>
ADB sources said Tuesday that the project will prepare 100,000
young people from poor backgrounds for jobs, especially in the
construction, insurance, real estate, transport, storage,
communications and manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
The project will restructure and re-orient the vocational
training system to ensure the quality and relevance of programs to
match the demands of industry, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It will introduce competency-based training, supported by
career guidance, entrepreneurship training, trade testing,
accreditation, staff development and the establishment of a
national vocational qualification system.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan will cover 49 percent of the total project's cost
of 38.5 million U.S. dollars. The loan is repayable in 32 years
with a grace period of eight years during which interest will be
at 1 percent and 1.5 percent annum thereafter.
</P>
<P>
The balance of the cost of the project will be financed by the
Nordic Development Fund, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries Fund for International Development and the Sri Lankan
government.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Foreign Minister
Hor Nam Hong Tuesday met a visiting Chinese trade and economic
expert delegation and discussed how further to strengthen the
trade and economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>

The eight-member delegation, which arrived here Saturday, is
headed by Guo Li, director of the Department of Asia Affairs of
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.

<P>
During the meeting, Hor briefed the delegation on Cambodia's
current political and economic situation, saying Cambodia's peace
and stability are very favorable for the nation's economic
construction and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said great progress has been made by the

government was formed last November. "The nation's economy has
resumed growth, the inflation rate dropped and the exchange rate
is stable," he said.

On the relationship between China and Cambodia, Hor said that
with the increasing development of the traditional friendship

percent in October, bringing the annual inflation rate in the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Media Splash Reports on WTO Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- All Beijing-based newspapers
today splashed impressive and vivid headlines and large photos,
mostly colored ones, on the Sino-U.S. agreement on China's entry
into the World Trade Organizations (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The historic accord was signed here Monday after six days of
negotiations and with concerted efforts of top leaders of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
The leading People's Daily devoted half of its frontpage to the
special coverage of President Jiang Zemin's meeting with U.S.
negotiators, signing ceremony of the accord, press communique, as
well as congratulatory remarks from President Bill Clinton and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang, U.S. negotiators Charlene Barshefsky
and Gene Sperling are seen at the frontpage photos in all smiles.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton also showed a hearty laugh at the frontpage
of China's English newspaper, China Daily, which hailed the inked
agreement as a "landmark pact."
</P>
<P>
The China Youth Daily placed President Jiang's hand-shaking
with Barshefsky atop its frontpage with a large-character headline
reading: "President Jiang Says, Where There Is A Will, There Is A
Way." Its another bold-character headline said that "Clouds
Cleared for China's Accession to WTO."
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Daily remarked with a relief in its headline,
saying that "China, U.S. Eventually Reach Agreement on WTO Entry,"
which reminds readerships of China's 13-year pursuit to the world
trade rule-making body.
</P>
<P>
The still more lively Beijing Youth Daily screamed a headline
that goes, "Signed! Sino-U.S. Agreement on WTO." It did not print
the story on its frontpage, nevertheless a half-page color photo
of Barshefsky and Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Shi Guangsheng in all smiles at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The daily then used three other subsequent pages to review the
WTO issue.
</P>
<P>
All other national newspapers, including Xinhua Daily Telegraph,
Economic Daily, Legal Daily, Worker' Daily, also carried the WTO
stories on their frontpages.
</P>
<P>
Before the print media could fully digest the accord and China'
s expected access to the WTO, the China Central Television (CCTV)
invited noted experts to analyze what the WTO access means to
ordinary Chinese people and business circles in the popular talk
show "Focus" this morning.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is learned that more follow-up stories will come
atop Chinese media on the impact of the WTO entry in the next few
days.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Help Maintain Indonesia's Unity --Indonesian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States has pledged
to help maintain Indonesia's unity, according to Indonesian
Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Observer Tuesday quoted Alwi as saying that U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had assured him in
Washington that the U.S. will back Jakarta's efforts to prevent a
breakup.
</P>
<P>
"State Secretary Albright 'swears' that the U.S. wants
Indonesia to remain intact, and pledges to help maintain
Indonesia's unity," Alwi was quoted by the newspaper as telling
reporters before leaving the U.S. for Japan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister was accompanying Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid who has visited the U.S. and is now on a visit
to Japan. Wahid will leave Tokyo for Jakarta on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. will send some sort of conflict resolution team to
deal with internal conflicts," the paper quoted Alwi as saying.
</P>
<P>
On the results of the meeting between Wahid and U.S. President
Bill Clinton in Washington on November 12, Alwi said Clinton said
Washington will keep supporting Indonesia in its attempts to
maintain its territorial unity and integrity and will not back
separatist movements in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Aceh will still be part of Indonesia and the U.S. will also
strive to make Aceh an integral part of Indonesia," Alwi quoted
Clinton as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. pledge came in light of the growing demand for a self
determination referendum in the restive province of Aceh, a
staunch Muslim province rich in natural resources.
</P>
<P>
More than one million Acehnese attended a meeting in Banda
Aceh, capital of Aceh province, on November 8, demanding a
referendum on the right of the people of that province to self
determination. This was an impressive display of solidarity since
the independence group Free Aceh Movement unilaterally declared
independence on December 4, 1976.
</P>
<P>
The new Indonesian government which was established at the end
of October is determined to give top priority to the settlement of
the Aceh problem.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Prime Minister Says China's WTO Entry Desirable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi on Tuesday welcomed a breakthrough agreement reached
between China and the United States on China's bid to join the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"China's participation in the world trade body is desirable,
and I am certainly glad," Obuchi told reporters at the Diet (
parliament) building.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi made the remarks while referring to the accord signed by
Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Shi
Guangsheng and U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky in
Beijing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other senior Japanese government officials also
hailed China's WTO deal.
</P>
<P>
Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said Japan will continue to
work together with other countries to realize China's membership
in the Geneva-based global trade body.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is extremely important from the point of
view of strengthening the WTO system, and will continue to
cooperate to realize China's participation," the top Japanese
government spokesman told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
In a separate press conference, Japanese Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa said the accord means all other WTO members would
be able to enjoy the preferential trade treatment measures agreed
on between Beijing and Washington.
</P>
<P>
Without China, a soon-to-be-launched round of global trade
talks sponsored by the WTO would produce totally different results,
Miyazawa stressed.

<HEADLINE> More Indonesian Fertile Couples Practice Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 60 to 70 percent of
Indonesia's fertile couples are expected to become family planning
acceptors by the year 2000, according to the United Nations Fund
for Population Agency (UNFPA).
</P>
<P>
"Today the number of Indonesian fertile couples that have
joined the family planning program accounts for 57 percent of 17
million fertile couples in the country, while the number of
self-reliant family planning acceptors is now 30 percent," said
UNFPA's chief representative in Indonesia, Nesim Tumkaya.
</P>
<P>
Tumkaya said UNFPA had always extended assistance to Indonesia
for the procurement of contraceptives to ensure that the family
planning and reproduction health programs could be intensified and
Indonesia would eventually achieve a balanced population growth by
the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
He said UNFPA had extended about 100 million U.S. dollars worth
of aid to Indonesia to support its family planning program since
the U.N. body established cooperation with the country in 1970.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone, UNFPA's aid to Indonesia's family planning
program was valued at 20 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA official also noted there were two important things
which should receive attention with respect to family planning,
namely abortion and mortality rate of women during labor.
</P>
<P>
There were one to 1.5 million reported cases of abortion per
year in Indonesia, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's GDP Projected to Rise by 0.12 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's gross domestic
product (GDP) is projected to rise by 0.12 percent this year,
another sign that the country's economy is improving, according to
the National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Based on the 1993 constant price, the 1999 GDP would be 376.5
trillion rupiah (53.8 billion U.S. dollars) compared to 376.1
trillion rupiah (53.72 billion dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
"This is still a prediction based on the assumption that
developments in the next quarter will be positive," said the head
of the bureau, Sugito Suwito.
</P>
<P>
Most economic sectors are predicted to undergo positive growth
this year, Sugito was quoted by the Antara News Agency Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Three sectors which are predicted to undergo negative growth
are hotel and restaurant (minus 0.95 percent), finance, leasing
and service companies (minus 88.58 percent) and transportation and
communications (minus 1.33 percent).
</P>
<P>
Electricity, gas and water are expected to grow quite rapidly
by 7.70 percent. Other sectors which are predicted to grow are
services (2.83 percent), processing industry (1.52 percent),
construction (1.04 percent), agriculture, animal husbandry,
forestry and fishery (1.01 percent) and mining and excavation
(0.04 percent).
</P>
<P>
Sugito said GDP per capita this year was expected to reach 5.4
million rupiah (about 771 U.S. dollars) or an increase of 16.66
percent from last year's record of 4.6 million rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economy contracted by more than 13 percent in 1998
as the economic crisis that started in the middle of 1997
deepened. But GDP started to grow in the second quarter of this
year at 1.82 percent compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank had earlier predicted third quarter GDP growth
at 0.2 percent, and full year GDP growth of between minus one
percent and zero percent.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks First-Round Pick Leon Smith Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Dallas Mavericks 19-year-
old forward Leon Smith reportedly has been committed to a
psychiatric ward after taking an apparent overdose of aspirin.
</P>
<P>
Smith, whose brief tenure in the league already has been marked
by insubordinance, was committed to a hospital on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Smith, who joined the team out of high school, also has been
charged with criminal mischief after breaking a car window.
</P>
<P>
As the 29th pick in the draft, Smith is in the first year of a
three-year, $1.772 million contract. He entered the NBA draft
directly out of high school in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The NBA champion San Antonio Spurs selected Smith with the last
pick of the first round and traded him to the Mavericks for the
rights to second-round pick Goran Giricek.
</P>
<P>
Although tall and talented, he was considered too raw for the
NBA and the Mavericks discussed having him play in the CBA or
Europe to get some badly needed experience. Instead, he has
remained in the Dallas area and was placed on the injured list
last week with a lower back strain.

<HEADLINE> Lhasa Handicapped to Enjoy Equal Education And Employment Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 16 (Xinhua)-- A small massage clinic in Lhasa
celebrated its tenth anniversary today. Qamba Chilai, the owner of
the clinic who has been blind for many years, stood in front of
the small clinic welcoming customers.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, with the help of the civil administration
department in Lhasa, Qamba and two of his blind friends opened
Tibet's first massage clinic.
</P>
<P>
More and more handicapped people in Lhasa do not want to rely
solely on government financial support and have managed to set up
their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
Lhasa has more than 21,000 disabled people, amounting to four
percent of the total population. Their per capita income is much
lower than the average level.
</P>
<P>
With support from the local government, some 35 disabled people
have learned special techniques in a local welfare school. They
make Tibetan handicrafts and sell them in the market.
</P>
<P>
Lobsang has set an example by establishing a language school.
Lobsang was also one of ten outstanding young people in Tibet who
received an award for his hard work in promoting education for the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
To create more job opportunities for the disabled, a law to
protect the handicapped will soon be implemented in Lhasa. The law
guarantees that the handicapped will have equal education and
employment opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Shipping Company Developing Myanmar Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar COSCO Limited of
China, a subsidiary company of the China Ocean Shipping Companies
(COSCO) Group, has been actively developing its market in Myanmar
and achieved initial success.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar COSCO Ltd was founded in October 1996. Not long
after its establishment, due to the impact of the Asian financial
crisis, many foreign companies investing in Myanmar pulled out one
after another for poor business operation.
</P>
<P>
But the Myanmar COSCO Ltd did not give up and has tried hard to
develop its business in the Myanmar market.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding, the company's container transport business
has grown from the import of only a dozen containers per month in
the initial period to the present average import and export
quantity of about 350 containers per month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the transport business of bulk cargo has grown out
of nothing, making it possible for four to five 10,000-ton vessels
to call at the Yangon Port every month.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar COSCO Ltd also undertakes trading business in
addition to the traditional transport business operation of
containers and bulk cargo.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the Myanmar COSCO Ltd Sun Liang told
Xinhua that Myanmar and China are friendly neighbors and the
friendly bilateral relationship is extremely conducive to the
promotion of economic and trade ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the Myanmar COSCO Ltd is also planning to invest and
establish real estate in Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Declassified Document Reveals U.S. Use of Defoliants in S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Forces Korea sprayed
more than 21,000 gallons of toxic defoliants in 1968-1969 along
the south of the Demilitarized Zone, South Korean media reports
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
None of some 7,000 South Korean soldiers knew they were
spraying three kinds of toxic materials -- Agent Orange, Agent
Blue and Monuron, and they were not given any warnings, masks or
proper protective gears, the media reports said, quoting a
declassified document of the U.S. Department of the Army.
</P>
<P>
The document said that under the "Vegetation Control Program
1968," the toxic defoliants were sprayed in the area some 100
meters wide and 155 miles long along the south of buffer zone to "
deny hostile forces the concealment provided by vegetation."
</P>
<P>
C.H. Bonesteel, then commander of the U.S. Forces Korea,
recommended spraying defoliants and got approval from then U.S.
Secretary of State Dean Rusk and South Korean Prime Minister Chung
Il-kwon.
</P>
<P>
The media reports accused both the U.S. and South Korean
governments of covering up the fact in the past 30 years, saying
many South Korean soldiers might have suffered cancers from the
sprayed defoliants.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Defense Ministry said Tuesday its has not
confirmed whether defoliants were used in the country.
</P>
<P>
The United States has denied use of defoliants in any other
country except Vietnam.

MEXICO CITY, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)

After meeting with Mexican senators, French Vice Foreign
Secretary Loic Hennekeine told the press that an eventual accord
between Mexico and the 15-nation European bloc will stimulate
trade and have an "essential political significance."
</P>
<P>
Trade between France and Mexico has increased in recent years,
but is obstructed by the North American Free Trade Agreement (
NAFTA), which, Hennekeine said, has restricted French firms'
access to Mexico's market.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Crash Probe May Be Handed Over to Another Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official
raised the possibility Monday of handing over the probe leadership
of the EgyptAir Flight 990 to another agency, hinting that the
plane was possibly downed by a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
"We are concentrating our efforts on determining from the
evidence, including the cockpit voice recorder, whether or not
this investigation is to remain under the leadership of the
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)," said NTSB Chairman
Jim Hall at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Hall acknowledged there have been "many rumors, theories and
stories" circulating about whether the crash was caused by
mechanical failure or a criminal act such as a hijacking, crew
fight or pilot suicide.
</P>
<P>
If there is evidence of a crime in the plane crash, the
investigation authority will be shifted to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) under U.S. rules.
</P>
<P>
The EgyptAir passenger plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean
off the Massachusetts coast on October 31, killing all 217 aboard.
</P>
<P>
Hall met with FBI Director Louis J. Freeh and other officials
Monday to discuss whether there was enough evidence to open a
criminal investigation, an Associated Press report quoted a law
enforcement official as saying.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Backs Motion Against Extraterritoriality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Argentina backs Chile in the
defense of a motion condemning judicial extraterritoriality,
visiting Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We're particularly concerned about the issue of
extraterritoriality being covered, as this is behind Chilean and
Argentine leaders who are absent from this summit," he said,
referring to the case of lifelong senator Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Chilean President Eduardo Frie has decided not to attend the
Ninth Ibero-American Summit to protest the arrest of former
Chilean leader Pinochet in Britain on an extradition request from
Spain. Argentine President Carlos Menem followed suit in
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The Ibero-American Summit, scheduled to open on Tuesday in the
Cuban capital, will focus on international finance and the effects
of economic globalization on developing countries, especially
those in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
According to Di Tella, imposing extraterritoriality in the
Pinochet case is wrong and will make the case more complicated.
</P>
<P>
Di Tella said Ibero-American countries can reach consensus on
issues including consequences of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that all countries of the bloc have suffered one way or
another from the effects of the crisis, calling for the
establishment of a world finance mechanism allowing emerging
countries to develop.
</P>
<P>
The Ibero-American Summit, grouping 22 member states, aims to
foster cooperation among Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking nations.
But only 16 heads of state will attend Tuesday's summit.
</P>
<P>
Other absentees will be Costa Rican President Miguel Angel
Rodrigues, Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman and Salvadoran
President Franciso Flores, because of political differences with
Cuba.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Garnett of the
Minnesota Timberwolves today was named NBA Player of the Week for
games played Monday, November 8, through Sunday, November 14.
</P>
<P>
Garnett led the Timberwolves to a 2-0 record last week by

14 rebounds and four assists. Garnett followed that performance
with 16 points, 12 rebounds, six assists and four blocked shots in
a 111-100 home victory over Phoenix on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Garnett currently ranks second in the NBA with a 29.0 scoring
average and second in rebounding at 13.8 rebounds per game. With
his performances last week, Garnett extended his double figure
scoring streak to 133 consecutive games, a Timberwolves' team
record.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates for NBA Player of the Week were Denver's Nick
Van Exel, Chicago's Hersey Hawkins, Miami's Alonzo Mourning,
Orlando's Darrell Armstrong, Sacramento's Chris Webber and Seattle

<HEADLINE> World Bank's Poverty Relief Project in Guangxi China Paying off (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- People in impoverished
mountainous areas in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region have been able to improve their living conditions by using
loans from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meng Jingfeng's family would have remained as poor as it had
been for generations if not for a life-altering change in 1996,
when her two sons received training to become transient workers,
and a WB loan worth 1,280 yuan (145 U.S. dollars) was allocated to
the family.
</P>
<P>
Her sons now send home 10,000 yuan a year. Meng's animal
husbandry business, which started with three seed hogs and four
heads of sheep bought with the loan, has already earned her some
luxuries: a new home, a motorcycle, and a color TV with a karaoke
attachment.
</P>
<P>
Meng's family is among 180,000 households in Guangxi's karst
terrain who were living under the country's poverty line -- a
level which made them eligible for the World Bank's poverty relief
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chengwei, an official with the poverty assistance office
under China's State Council, told Xinhua that Guangxi has
completed 82 percent of the six-year project, whose final aim is
to alleviate poverty for 3.5 million people in the region of
Guangxi and Guizhou and Yunnan provinces in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
These areas are part of the most barren territory in China,
with little arable soil and drinkable water. The World Bank has
worked out a package of plans for the regions to permanently wipe
out poverty by developing the local economy and improving
community construction, education, sanitation condition,
infrastructure and agriculture, he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Thailand to Form Entity to Buy INRO Rubber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Thailand
have agreed to set up a joint venture entity to buy natural rubber
stocks from the disbanded International Natural Rubber
Organization (INRO), local press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached here Monday at a meeting between
Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik and Thailand's
Deputy Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Arkom Angchuan, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the two countries will work out details of
the joint venture, the Business Times quoted Lim Keng Yaik as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral cooperation could be extended to include Indonesia,
Lim said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia together account for about 80
percent of the world's rubber output.
</P>
<P>
INRO, which was disbanded on October 13 following the
withdrawal of Malaysia and Thailand, needs to dispose of some
140,000 tons of rubber stocks over a three-year period, which Lim
Keng Yaik said would adversely affect the market.
</P>
<P>
Lim said that with the demise of INRO, there was a need now to
revise the role of the Association of Natural Rubber Producing
Countries (ANRPC) to meet new challenges that are likely to be
faced by natural rubber producers.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Thailand will call for an ANRPC ministerial
meeting before the end of March 2000 to evaluate the association's
new role and to reaffirm members' commitment towards close
cooperation, he said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank's Poverty Relief Project in Guangxi Paying Off (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He explained that the bank has been conducting the poverty
relief experiment in impoverished regions with poor geographic
conditions since the 1960s. Many of the programs carried out in
Africa have failed. The project in Guangxi, however, which has
about 75 percent of its northwestern part covered by limestone
mountain slopes, has been paying off.
</P>
<P>
In Mashan County, for example, where Meng's family lives, the
bank has launched 110 million yuan in loans since 1995 to help
solve the drinking water problem for 270,000 people and build
roads leading to every village.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 97 percent of the population in the impoverished
county have been lifted above the country's poverty line and 99
percent of school-aged children go to school.
</P>
<P>
"The project has stressed the importance of developing local
residents' awareness of the need to help themselves out of poverty
rather than merely to receive funding assistance," said Huang
Chengwei.
</P>
<P>
The project is the World Bank's first direct investment for
poverty relief in China. The successful result has encouraged the
WB to offer similar help to other poor areas in the country. The
Qinling-Bashan mountains in northwest China's Sichuan, Shaanxi and
Gansu provinces will become the next WB poverty relief target.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The week-long lockout at Canada
's biggest port of Vancouver was lifted late Monday with a deal
reached between the disputing longshoremen's union and employers'
association.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Labor Minister Claudette Bradshaw told the House of
Commons in Ottawa that the dispute between 2,000 longshoremen and
local employers over non-union work and wages had cost the country
90 million Canadian dollars (about 61 million U.S. dollars) a day.
</P>
<P>
As many as 5,000 containers have been stockpiled at the port,
while business operations with 90 countries have been affected.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, local television said a four-year contract
has been reached through federal mediation to avoid further crises
at the Port of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
The port, which handles 31 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods
annually, had already been hit in July by a four-week strike of
independent truckers. Between 1982 and 1995, a total of eight
wage disputes brought port operations to devastating standstills.

<HEADLINE> Sale of Residential Houses Looms for Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijing house-owners are
flocking to take advantage of new rules which allow them to sell
their houses.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources believe around 700,000 private houses may be
put up for sale, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of residents have already approached housing
departments across the city to apply for approval to put their
houses on the market.
</P>
<P>
In housing department of Xuanwu district, more than 100 eager
sellers have crowded into the office building since yesterday
morning, keeping officials busy issuing forms and answering
questions.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't expect such enthusiasm, but we are happy because
the high demand proves that the government has made the right
decision to allow house selling on the second hand market," an
official said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing issued a regulation a month ago unveiling plans to
allow residents to sell their private houses, most of which were
previously publicly owned.
</P>
<P>
The city's 18 housing departments had met "the same keen and
positive reaction" from house sellers yesterday, an official with
the housing department was quoted by China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chen Tongshun, director of the Marketing Office of the city's
Real Estate and Housing Administration, said the printing of all
the forms was completed last Friday. Residents must take them,
along with housing ownership certificates, residency ID, and other
documents to apply for two forms.
</P>
<P>
One is for their qualification confirmation, and another asks
owners for their selling price and the effective duration of their
offer. Official departments will tell the applicants within 15
days whether they can go ahead or not.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said the ratio of house sellers to buyers
stands at one to four. However, analysts said while yesterday's
hustle and bustle would give a boost to the new market, it will
also have a tremendous impact on the sale of commercial housing.
</P>
<P>
Some real estate developers have started to worry that the low-
cost of such houses will affect sales of new houses meant for
potential low or middle-income families.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-U.S. agreement on
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is like a
Christmas present for Finnish industries eyeing the huge Chinese
market, Finnish mass media said Monday.
</P>
<P>
With substantive coverage on the talks in Beijing, the Finnish
News Agency hailed the accord as paving the way for China's entry
into the WTO after 13 years of tortuous negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Finnish TV Channel One broadcast the news on its evening
nationwide hook-up and aired scenes of Chinese President Jiang
Zemin meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed by China and the United States on Monday
will see marked reduction of China's tariffs, giving Finnish firms
significant access to the Chinese market, said Finnish TV Channel
One.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Finland and China has grown rapidly in recent
years, with China becoming Finland's third largest trading partner
following the United States and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Besides Nokia and timber-processing firms, a large number of
small and medium-sized Finnish firms are seeking to widen their
market shares in China.
</P>
<P>
China has yet to conclude bilateral talks on the WTO terms with
the EU, of which Finland is a member country.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- International Boxing
Federation president Bob Lee pleaded innocent in New Jersey on
Monday in connection with a 32-count federal racketeering
indictment charging that rankings were manipulated.
</P>
<P>
Lee and three other officials in the IBF solicited 338,000 U.S.
dollars in bribes, the indictment alleges.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors revealed that they would be giving the defense
several hundred hours of audio and video tapes collected during an
investigation. They also are seeking to freeze two IBF bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
A judge will rule on that at the end of the month and set a
tentative trial date of January 11.
</P>
<P>
The charges followed a two-year federal grand jury inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The indictment, which charges a 13-year conspiracy in which IBF
rankings were bought, refers to seven promoters and 23 boxers
involved in briberies only by number.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Groups Hail China-U.S. WTO Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The principal organization
of American companies operating and investing in China welcomed
news Monday that China and the U.S. had reached an agreement on
the terms of China's access to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Michael R. Bonsignore, chairman of the U.S.-China Business
Council, stressed in a statement the importance of the WTO
breakthrough for the U.S. national interest and for the overall
future of U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
"China's entry into the WTO will serve to solidify and further
its recent economic reforms, as well as to increase the openness
and transparency of the Chinese commercial environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Not only do we see this agreement as highly significant in
terms of its commercial impact, but we also view it as an
important signal of China's commitment and desire to engage in the
global community and one of its most important institutions."
</P>
<P>
Total trade between the two countries in 1998 rose by more than
13 percent over the previous year, according to the council. With
total trade approaching 90 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 and an
installed U.S. investment in China of over 21 billion dollars, the
U.S. ranks the second among China's trade partners, while China is
the fourth largest trade partner of the United States, the council
noted.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday, Fred Webber, president of the U.S.
Chemical Manufacturers Association, said that the accord "
represents a significant achievement that will benefit American
consumers and American businesses."
</P>
<P>
"Bringing China into the World Trade Organization will expand
choices for American consumers and ensure that China will conform
to international trade rules that benefit the American economy,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"This development will expand opportunities for the U.S.
chemical industry and the more than one million American men and
women who work in it," the statement added. "It deserves the
enthusiastic support of the American people and swift approval by
the Congress of legislation granting the normal trade relations
status to China. The chemical industry will strongly advocate the
implementation of China's entry into the WTO."
</P>
<P>
The chemical industry is the largest exporter in the U.S.,
accounting for one 10th of the country's total exports. U.S.
chemical sales totaled 392 billion dollars in 1998, with 68
billion dollars worth of products exported.

<P>
LIMA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen people were injured when
a cargo train collided with a bus in Peru on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened early morning at a crossroad of the
central highway, not far from the weighing station of the Ministry
of Transport, said the police.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that the loud music from the car-based radio had
impeded the car driver from hearing the sound of the train,
although some passengers said the bus was traveling at an
excessive speed before it hit the third wagon of the train and
consequently had the front of the car destroyed, police sources
said.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said that the section of the highway where
the crash happened is considered a "death trap," since the lack of
adequate lighting and luminous signs has caused a series of
accidents in recent years.

<P>
NANNING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Motorola will help Nanning,
capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, to
build a social emergency network.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed early this week between the
American company and Nanning, Motorola will be responsible for
designing the network and for providing computers and other
telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, equipment needed in building the
network and supporting works is expected to cost 90 million yuan (
about 10.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
There are many emergency telephone services in China, such as
dialing 110 to report crimes, 119 for fire disasters, 120 for
medical aids and 122 for road accidents. However, many cities in
China do not have a unified access to these numbers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Northwest China to Build Herbal Medicine Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, November 16 (Xinhua)-- A large traditional Chinese
herbal medicine base will be built in northwest China's Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region over the next ten years, according to the
local government.
</P>
<P>
Ma Qizhi, governor of the regional government, said that as a
key project in China's strategic move to step up the development
of western China, the medicine base is likely to spur the social
and economic progress of this ethnic autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has rich resources of medicinal herbs. A recent survey
shows that Ningxia is home to over 1,100 species of traditional
medicinal herbs, with reserves of more than 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Lycium chinense and licorice root are just two of the most
notable. They have a long growing history in China and enjoy a
high reputation in the world market.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, a 10,000-hectare medicine base valued at some
five billion yuan (about 570 U.S. dollars) will be set up in the
region by expanding the present cultivating areas of several
typical traditional Chinese medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the autonomous region will take steps to ensure a
smooth and healthy development of medicine processing industry.
Ma added that Ningxia will also make efforts to protect the
ecological environment.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Panel Votes for Controversial Rights Probe in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. council voted on
Monday in favor of a controversial inquiry into alleged human
rights violations in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The Economic and Social Council endorsed the call for the U.N.
Secretary-General to establish an international commission of
inquiry to gather information since a referendum to decide
political status of the territory had begun in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 27 in favor to 10 against and 11 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
China, India, Indonesia, Oman, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia,
Sri Lanka, Syria and Viet Nam were against.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in explanation of vote, Indonesia's representative
Wibisono reiterated his country's rejection of the decision to set
up the inquiry body, as the Special Session of the Human Rights
Commission in Geneva in September had been held under "highly
controversial" circumstances.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the first time that such a session was held
without any support from the countries of the region concerned.
</P>
<P>
The member states of the Association of South East Asian
Nations maintained the view that the the convening of the session
was not in accordance with the Rules of Procedure as the required
majority to convene the session had not been achieved, he added.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Kunto Umeda drew attention to what he called the
"serious irregularities" in the decision-making process leading to
the convening of the session on Monday.
</P>
<P>
India's Satyabrata Pal said he would vote against the draft due
to grave procedural irregularities by the U.N. Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
"What happened in East Timor after the referendum did not fall
into the category of breaches in international humanitarian law,
and thus the mandate was flawed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Requesting a second inquiry was a waste of time and money," he
added.

<HEADLINE> British Olympic Showjumping Hero Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- British Olympic equuestrian
hero Sir Harry Llewellyn, who secured his country the only gold
medal in the 1952 games, has died. He was 88, his Aintree but will
be chiefly remembered for keeping an ice-cool nerve to clinch the
team showjumping gold for Britain.
</P>
<P>
Riding Foxhunter, a horse bred in Norfolk for hunting, the
lieutenant-colonel needed a clear round to win the last event of
the Games.
</P>
<P>
They were faultless and added gold at last to Britain's tally
of two silver and eight bronze medals from the Games. The other
team members were Wilfred White and Douglas Stewart.
</P>
<P>
Sir Harry, who was knighted in 1977 for his services to Welsh
business, also won a team bronze at the 1948 London Olympics,
again with Foxhunter. The pair won 78 international events. The
horse died in 1959, aged 19.
</P>
<P>
During the war, Sir Harry saw action in Italy and Normandy and
was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Field Marshal
Montgomery for working as his liaison officer.
</P>
<P>
He was chairman of the Sports Council of Wales from 1971 to
1981.

<HEADLINE> Spirit on the Up under Keegan's Regime of Trust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- England football team captain
Alan Shearer declared the spirit in the England camp "could not be
any better" as Kevin Keegan's increasing trust in his players
appeared to be paying dividends in the run-up to the return clash
against Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Keegan's reaction to his players' 2-0 Euro 2000 play-off first
leg victory at Hampden Park was to immediately give them 24 hours
off with the one simple instruction that they should not visit a
nightclub.
</P>
<P>
He also allowed Paul Scholes to travel home to Manchester on
Monday to visit his sick baby following a worried phone call from
his wife, although the midfielder was expected back in readiness
for training on Tuesday after the all-clear.
</P>
<P>
The players clearly relish the approach of the England coach,
who is happy to place his trust in them as his fate lies in their
hands at Wembley on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
David Seaman also missed training because of a "slight calf
problem", but Keegan is confident the goalkeeper will be back on
Tuesday to prove his fitness. Nigel Martyn would otherwise start,
but Keegan admits there is "no logical reason" to change a winning
side even though Andy Cole is still competing for Michael Owen's
place up front.
</P>
<P>
Above all, Keegan and his captain Shearer are determined to
ensure there should be no impression of the England camp taking
victory for granted even after seizing such an apparently
convincing advantage over the Scots.
</P>
<P>
Keegan insists the key is now to repeat the performance, but
the undiminished sense of a common purpose was as evident in the
players' outlook as it had been in their team display at Hampden
Park.
</P>
<P>
Shearer, a relative veteran with experience of four England
managers, was unwilling to comment on his own apparently uneasy
relationship with Glenn Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
But he declared: "The spirit in the camp is fantastic, and I
don't think it could be any better to be honest. We're all rolling
in the same direction, which is hopefully qualifying for the
European Championships - and it's really good to see.
</P>
<P>
"Kevin Keegan is a figurehead and goes out of his way to have a
good relationship with everyone, and that's very important as a
manager because you will then get the best out of your players. He
makes a special case to give the players what they ask for; he
gets on with everyone and treats everyone with respect."

<HEADLINE> Brown Seeks Backing for Wembley Shock Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Scotland football team manager
Craig Brown insists everyone inside the Scotland camp is 100%
focused on shocking England at Wembley and clinching an unlikely
Euro 2000 place - and wants those outside to back them to the hilt.
</P>
<P>
The Scotland boss has been annoyed that attention has shifted
from the job in hand to his own position, when Brown his clearly
confident his troops can pull the play-off out of the fire.
</P>
<P>
Despite the 2-0 defeat at Hampden on Saturday, Brown insists
the Scots matched Kevin Keegan's England in every department and
will not hear of any defeatist talk at, as he put it, "half-time."
</P>
<P>
The wretched luck that seems to have plagued him in the last
few weeks continues however, with the news that Everton midfielder
Don Hutchison may miss the second leg underneath the Twin Towers
with a calf strain.
</P>
<P>
Brown feels it is high time Scotland got a couple of lucky
breaks and after the agony of the injury to classy Celtic
playmaker Paul Lambert and Billy Dodds' shot hitting the bar
against the English, few would argue that he does not have a point.
</P>
<P>
And he is calling on everyone with Scotland's best interests at
heart to forget about any side issues and instead to unite in
support in the common cause of vanquishing the Auld Enemy.
</P>
<P>
Brown said: "We are determined to recover the situation and one
thing I can guarantee is whoever plays on Wednesday will give
their all.
</P>
<P>
"In any sport, be it golf, snooker or football, leads are lost
and the least we need is two goals.
</P>
<P>
"We have got to look to get them, but at the same time we must
be patient - look at Manchester United in last year's Champions
League
final. We have to be patient even if it takes us until then (the
dying minutes)," he said.

WARSAW, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Warsaw is ready to bid for the
2016 Summer Olympics, seven years earlier than the International

</P>
<P>
The secretary-general of the Polish Olympic Committee, Janusz

"It is essential to start early," he said.

The next Olympics will be held at Sydney in 2000 and Athens in

PANAMA CITY, November 15 (Xinhua)-- Relations between Panama
and United States will be stronger after December 31, special
envoy of President Bill Clinton for Latin America Kenneth Buddy
MacKay said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
After U.S. military withdrawal and the return of the Canal to
Panamanian sovereignty, both countries will tighten trade links,
Buddy said.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian economy's future doesn't depend weather there is or
not any military presence after, said the American official at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
[United States must give back this interoceanic route at latest
at noon on December 31, 1999, under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties
signed by both nations in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The present government of President Mireya Moscoso has
reiterated its negative to allow extending American military
presence after year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to Moscoso, both countries' relations in the new
century must be built on a basis of mutual respect and bilateral
cooperation.

Kenneth, who participated Monday as main speaker in the
Conference regarding the Future of Negotiations in the Americas,
also said that after U.S. withdrawal from Panama, the dollar will
continue circulating in the country.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the dollarizing of Latin American economies, proposed
by Argentine President Carlos Menem, Clinton's envoy said his
country watches sympathetically this process, although it isn't an
American idea.

"Every country should think deeply about the impact of a

WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese computer maker
Legend Holdings dislodged the United States' International
Business Machines (IBM) as the biggest seller of personal
computers in the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan in the third
quarter, marking the first time Legend has gained the top spot,
according the International Data Corp.(IDC), a market-research
firm.
</P>
<P>
Legend led with an 8.5 percent market share, up from 6 percent
in the previous quarter and 5.7 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The gain in market share was largely because of aggressive
pricing in the Chinese market and a weak performance from other
vendors, The Wall Street Journal quoted an IDC official as saying.
</P>
<P>
IBM was second with a 7.8 percent market share, while Compaq
Computer came in third with a 7.4 percent share.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new survey by AC Nielsen eRatings.com shows that
Singapore and New Zealand have the highest Internet-penetration
rates in the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan, with 32 percent of

<HEADLINE> U.S.-China WTO Agreement Sends Grain, Soybean Prices Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-China agreement
that may open up the Chinese market to more American farmers drove
grain and soybean prices sharply higher Monday on the Chicago
Board of Trade, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, announced Monday, China would cut tariffs
an average of 23 percent once it joins the World Trade
Organization. U.S. President Bill Clinton said it should provide
unprecedented opportunities for American farmers and others who
will be enabled more access to the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press, soybean futures also were
underpinned by the reported sale of 25,000 tons of U.S. soybeans
to China over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Wheat prices were supported by continuing dry conditions in the
U.S. hard red winter wheat belt.
</P>
<P>
Corn futures were only slightly higher, benefiting from the
rally in wheat and a technical recovery from last week's slump.
</P>
<P>
Wheat for December delivery rose more than 5 cents to 2.50 U.S.
dollars a bushel; January soybeans rose more than 6 cents to 4.69
dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
Beef futures were mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, while pork bellies rose dramatically and lean hogs also
increased.
</P>
<P>
December live cattle were unchanged at 70.27 cents a pound;
January feeder cattle rose.48 cent to 83.90 cents a pound;
December lean hogs rose .93 cent to 51.25 cents a pound; February
frozen pork bellies rose 3 cents to 77.27 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Community Praises U.S.-China WTO Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Business community in the
United States hailed on Monday the signing of an agreement on
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) between
Washington and Beijing, and vowed to continue efforts to lobby the
Congress into granting China permanent Normal Trade Relations.
</P>
<P>
The United States Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas
J. Donohue, in a news release received here just several hours
after China and the United States signed the long-awaited WTO
agreement, described the event as "a landmark opportunity to open
up China's vast market to American companies of all sizes."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber, the world's largest business federation
representing more than three million businesses and organizations
of every size, sector and region, will launch a major lobbying
campaign in support of China's entry into the WTO and permanent
Normal Trade Relations for China if the agreement can be supported
by American business and if China reaches agreement with other WTO
members, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
"American business will explain to Congress the tremendous
benefits that China's entry into the WTO would mean for this
country in terms of future economic growth and job creation,"
Donohue was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM),
America's largest and oldest multitrade association representing
14,000 members and 350 member associations in all industrial
sectors, "strongly praised" the accomplishment of bilateral talks
between the U.S. and China regarding China's accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major breakthrough for American companies and their
workers, offering hundreds of millions of potential new
customers," said NAM President Jerry Jasinowski.
</P>
<P>
Jasinowski said that the Chinese people will benefit
economically, socially and politically.
</P>
<P>
"WTO membership will also help China's fledging business
community successfully assimilate itself into the rules-based
commercial system that covers the majority of the world's
companies," he added.
</P>
<P>
United Technology Corporation (UTC), a 25.7-billion-dollar
Fortune 50 company that provides a broad range of high technology
products and support services to the building systems and
aerospace industries, applauded the WTO deal as "an important
breakthrough in the U.S.-China relationship that signals China's
intention to become a full partner in the global trading system."
</P>
<P>
"It is now essential that Congress grant permanent NTR to China
for the U.S. to take full advantage of the agreement," said Ruth
R. Harkin, senior vice president for international affairs and
government relations of UTC and chair of United Technologies
international.
</P>
<P>
Harkin pledged in a news release that UTC will work hard "to
educate Members on the substantial economic benefits this
agreement offers, including lower tariff rates and the removal of
non-tariff barriers to trade."
</P>
<P>
Standard &AMP; Poor's, in a news release on Monday, said that the
expected entry of China into WTO will "fortify its standing by
firmly anchoring its policy of trade liberalization within a
framework of international laws."
</P>
<P>
"The immediate impact on China's trade balance is expected to
be mild, but the long-term impact should be deeper," said David
Beers, managing director of Standard &AMP; Poor's sovereign ratings
group.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO agreement should bolster export prospects, even as it
places more competitive pressures on domestic producers," said
Joydeep Mukherji, associate director in Standard &AMP; Poor's
sovereign ratings group.
</P>
<P>
Standard &AMP; Poor's said that China has adhereed to its reform
policies successfully throughout the Asian crisis and is likely to
persevere with more restructuring in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Alliance for Trade Expansion (USTrade), which
represents more than 150 million consumers, farmers, and workers
who conduct over two trillion dollars in annual trade, applauded
the WTO agreement as "the capstone of 13 years of hard work toward
rules-based market opening."
</P>
<P>
USTrade Chairman Scott Miller said "the more trade barriers
fall, the more new customers there are for American products and
services, which makes a better life for workers and families here
and abroad."
</P>
<P>
He also noted in a news release that expanded trade will help
raise standards of living in China.
</P>
<P>
"China's opening to the world has already lifted hundreds of
millions of people out of poverty. By taking the important steps
toward multilateral, rules-based trade, China's people can look
forward to better lives," he said.

UNITED NATIONS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday urged Afghanistan's biggest warring faction
the Taliban to protect U.N. property and guarantee the safety of
U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said he
is distressed about the attacks in Kabul on UN offices.
</P>
<P>
The UN sanctions on Afghanistan went into force Sunday after
the Taliban failed to hand over the Saudi dissident Osama bin
laden.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, crowds angry about the
sanctions imposed on Afghanistan by the U.N. Security Council
smashed windows and doors, furniture and computers and set fire to
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee
(UNHCR) in Kabul and other offices in that country, causing
extensive damage.
</P>
<P>
Tension in Kabul was reported to be high Monday as new protests
were reported in other locations in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
UN offices in Farah also became the target of protests today
with the UNHCR office being burned and a number of vehicles
damaged and windows broken at the office of the UN Office for
Project Service.
</P>
<P>
No UN staff has been injured in these attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed Monday on concerns about interest rates before the Federal
Reserve meets on the monetary policy in Washington tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 8.57 at 10,760.75.
The blue chip index gained 173.71 points last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 1.67 at 1,394.39 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 1.61 at 3,219.54.
</P>
<P>
The stock prices were little changed as investors took a
wait-and-see attitude toward the rates. The Federal Reserve raised
the rates twice in June and August in an effort to battle
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Investors did not know whether the Federal Reserve will raise
the rates for the third time this year at the meeting Tuesday
after the government reports in recent weeks showed that the U.S.
economy continued to growth without inflation. The stocks rose
strongly last Friday after the Labor Department reported that
worker productivity jumped in the third quarter while growth in
labor costs moderated.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 0.64 and the American Stock Exchange index

UNITED NATIONS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full
text of the message from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the
International Day of Tolerance, to be marked on November 16:
</P>
<P>
"On this last International Day of Tolerance of the Twentieth
Century, I wish to pay tribute to all the men and women who have
given their lives in the struggle for tolerance and human rights.
Though this has been the bloodiest of all centuries, it has also
witnessed remarkable progress -- not least in the respect for the
rights of groups and individuals hiterto discriminated against.
Racism, sexism, and homophobia have been confronted and defeated
in more places and in more ways than in any other time in human
history.
</P>
<P>
While this progress should give up hope and encouragement, it
must not make us complacent. The struggle for tolerance is the
struggle for humanity itself. For without tolerance in a world
increasingly characterized by globalization and cooperation, the
future itself is at risk. As greater parts of humanity encounter
different cultures and races, either through travel or
immigration, it becomes incumbent upon all of us to seek out and
embrace what unites us, and not what divides us.
</P>
<P>
As we enter a new century, the United Nations will place
tolerance at the center of all our efforts for peace and progress.
Tolerance fosters dialogue where differences persist,
understanding where suspicious prevail, and cooperation where
divisions have impaired progress for too long. Tolerance must
become a priority not only for the United Nations and its Member
States. As individuals, we can advance the cause of tolerance in
every day of our lives. Let that be our goal for the next
century." End text.
