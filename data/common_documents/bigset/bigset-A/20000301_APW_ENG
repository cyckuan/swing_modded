<HEADLINE> Following Stroke Drug Rules Urged  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Two studies released today found that guidelines
for taking a revolutionary clot-busting drug are frequently
violated -- lapses that may be causing dangerous bleeding and even
deaths among stroke victims.
</P>
<P>
   For TPA to be effective, it must be administered within three
hours of the onset of a stroke or it's ineffective and may be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors must also perform a brain scan first to rule out
bleeding in the brain. TPA can cause bleeding or worsen a
hemorrhage, with sometimes fatal results.
</P>
<P>
   The studies appear in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association. The findings validate ''the concerns that a lot of
physicians have had that if you're not careful about exactly how
you're using this medication, you might do more harm than good,''
said Dr. Gregory Albers, a Stanford University neurologist and lead
author of one of the studies.
</P>
<P>
   Strokes are the nation's third-leading cause of death, killing
an estimated 159,000 people each year and leaving many survivors
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   TPA, or tissue plasminogen activator, is the only federally
approved drug treatment. It won quick approval in 1996 after
research demonstrated its benefits in strokes caused by clots in
the brain. About 80 percent of the estimated 600,000 strokes
reported each year are caused by such clots.
</P>
<P>
   While TPA is expensive -- about $2,000 per intravenous dose -- it
is cost-effective in the long run by preventing or lessening
neurological damage caused by strokes, Albers said.
</P>
<P>
   TPA was approved with a mandate for another study of its
benefits. That study was led by Albers, whose results are similar
to the initial research.
</P>
<P>
   Albers' study involved 57 medical centers nationwide that were
well-versed in TPA treatment. It was funded by Genentech, the maker
of the drug. The second study -- of 29 community hospitals in the
Cleveland area -- offers a snapshot of what happens when TPA
treatment is attempted in less experienced settings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland researchers examined 3,948 stroke patients. Only
70 -- just 1.8 percent -- were given TPA, suggesting that eligible
patients were being overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   But in half of those who did get the drug, treatment guidelines
were violated. Some patients got TPA as much as six hours after the
three-hour deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Those violations contributed to a slightly higher death rate
than in Albers' study and significantly more cases of bleeding in
the brain, said Dr. Irene Katzan, a neurologist at the Cleveland
Clinic Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the TPA patients -- 15.7 percent -- had brain bleeding,
more than three times the rate in Albers' study. Six of those died.
Five other Cleveland-area TPA patients also died in the hospital,
for a mortality rate of 15.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the study by Albers and his colleagues, 389 patients were
treated with TPA. Fifty-one died within a month, a mortality rate
of 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five percent were essentially normal and showed no sign
of stroke complications 30 days after TPA treatment. Forty-three
percent were able to go home and care for themselves, though they
had some mild complications such as slurred speech.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment guidelines were violated in about a third of the
patients. Brain bleeding occurred in 3.3 percent within three days
of TPA treatment, and seven of those died.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line here is you've got to stick with the
guidelines and get the patient in within the three-hour window,''
said Dr. Edgar Kenton, a neurologist at Thomas Jefferson University
in Philadelphia who serves on the American Heart Association's
stroke council.

<HEADLINE> Implants Aiding Hemophilia  </HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thimble-size implants allowed guinea pigs and a
monkey churn out a protein that can treat hemophilia, researchers
reported in a study that suggests a new approach to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The animals did not have the bleeding disorder, so the study
didn't directly test whether the implants could reverse the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But blood samples showed the implants converted a natural
protein from the animals into useful amounts of an activated form,
called Factor VIIa, that is now used in hemophilia treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The work was reported in the March issue of the journal Nature
Biotechnology by Dr. Harvey Pollard of the Uniformed Services
University School of Medicine in Bethesda, Md., and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Hemophilia is caused by the lack of a clot-promoting protein,
usually one called Factor VIII. Patients can be treated with
infusions of that protein. But some 15 percent of such patients
develop antibodies that inactivate the infused protein. They can be
treated with infusions of Factor VIIa instead, but that is
expensive and the protein disintegrates quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The implants could avoid both those drawbacks, as well as the
antibody problem, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The implants are porous chambers containing a substance that
converts Factor VII to Factor VIIa. The monkey, which had three
implants in its abdomen, generated Factor VIIa for a month before
the implants were removed for inspection. However, the production
petered out over that period, and Pollard said it is not clear why.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard said he hopes human testing can begin within a year or
two.

<HEADLINE> No Breast Feeding May Cut HIV  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The number of infants who get the AIDS virus from
their mothers could drop by more than 40 percent if infected women
avoided breast-feeding, researchers reported today.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, led by researcher Ruth Nduati in Nairobi, studied
401 HIV-infected women and their infants in Kenya. Their findings
appear in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers were randomly assigned to breast-feed or to use
formula. The authors found that formula use prevented 44 percent of
infant infections.
</P>
<P>
   The frequency of breast-milk transmission of the virus was
estimated at 16 percent, though the authors said the rate was
likely higher since more than one-fourth of the women in the
formula group admitted they also breast-fed their infants.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations' figures show that 590,000 infants got HIV from
their mothers in 1998, 90 percent of them in Africa. The study's
findings suggest that if infected mothers used formula instead,
that number would fall to about 260,000.
</P>
<P>
   Like previous research, the study found indications that the
biggest risk for transmission occurs in the early weeks of
breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Younger infants might have more immature immune systems, and,
the researchers noted, exposure to infected milk ''diminishes as
weaning foods are introduced and milk intake declines.''
</P>
<P>
   While breast-feeding was clearly linked to HIV infection, both
the formula and breast-feeding groups had similar death rates at 2
years -- about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That finding illustrates one of the drawbacks of formula-feeding
in developing countries, where tainted water can cause fatal
diarrhea in infants and breast-feeding is more affordable and
culturally accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
recommends that infants of HIV-infected women not be breast-fed, a
standard adopted in the industrialized world. But the World Health
Organization has said that even HIV-positive mothers should
breast-feed in areas where infectious disease and malnutrition are
leading causes of infant mortality, the authors noted.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations guidelines suggest that infected women in
developing areas be told of the risks and benefits of
breast-feeding, and the authors say their findings will help such
women make better choices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that we have a good estimate of the risk, our goal should
be to put knowledge into practice,'' said Dr. Joan Kreiss, a
co-author and infectious disease specialist at the University of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A CDC report in the same issue of the journal said better
understanding of the timing of HIV transmission related to
breast-feeding is needed to determine the best way to prevent
infection in children. The authors note that previous research has
suggested that breast-feeding exclusively may be less risky than
alternating breast-feeding with formula in very young infants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Exclusive breast-feeding followed by early weaning'' is among
prevention strategies that need further research, the authors said.

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Boosts ABC in Ratings  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC claimed its second straight ratings
''sweeps'' month victory, and you won't need a lifeline to figure
out why.
</P>
<P>
   The network won its first February ratings sweep period since
1988 behind the indomitable ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,''
which accounted for five of the seven most-watched television shows
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ABC also won in November. Ratings are used during sweeps month
to set local advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Rival networks, to blunt the impact of a sweeps month loss,
pointed out that ABC's success was almost solely attributable to
one show, since ''Millionaire'' accounted for 18 percent of the
network's prime-time schedule in February.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had I had 'Millionaire,'' I would have had it on 25 percent of
my schedule,'' CBS President Leslie Moonves said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''All things have to fall,'' top NBC researcher Alan Wurtzel
said. ''At some point, there will be a saturation. It's just that
nobody knows exactly when.''
</P>
<P>
   Not last week, plainly. All five ''Millionaire'' editions drew
between 23 million and 29 million viewers, according to Nielsen
Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the game show isn't necessarily destroying everything in its
path. CBS had the best ratings since 1993 for its telecast of the
Grammy Awards, and was up 12 percent in viewers over last year,
despite competing during its first hour with ''Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Frasier'' also had strong ratings last week despite
going up against the game show.
</P>
<P>
   CBS was the winner in Sunday's faceoff of high-profile movies.
Its ''Perfect Murder, Perfect Town'' movie about JonBenet Ramsey
had nearly 19 million viewers, a million more than ABC's movie
about the Beach Boys. Part one of NBC's miniseries, ''The 10th
Kingdom,'' lagged far behind with 14 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, ABC averaged 16.6 million viewers in prime-time
(10.9 rating, 18 share). CBS was second with 14.9 million viewers
(10.0, 16), NBC had 13 million viewers (8.9, 14), and Fox had 9.8
million viewers (6.3, 10).
</P>
<P>
   Among the mini-networks, UPN had 3.8 million viewers (2.6
rating, 4 share), the WB had 3.7 million viewers (2.7, 4) and Pax
TV had 1 million viewers (0.8, 1).
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ''World News Tonight'' led the evening news competition
with 11.5 million viewers (8.2 rating, 16 share). NBC's ''Nightly
News'' had 11.2 million viewers (8.3 rating, 17 share) and the
''CBS Evening News'' had 8.8 million viewers (6.7, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. It's
possible for a show to have a higher rating than a competitor but
fewer viewers; that indicates the higher-rated show had more people
watching alone.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of Feb. 21-27, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings were ''ER,'' NBC, 20.7; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Tuesday), ABC, 18.8; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday),
ABC, 17.8; ''Grammy Awards,'' CBS, 17.3; ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 17.2; ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' (Wednesday), 15.9; ''Friends,'' NBC, 14.4;
''Frasier,'' NBC, 14.3; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (Friday),
ABC, 14.0; ''CBS Sunday Movie: Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,'' CBS,
12.9.

<HEADLINE> Kathie Lee Gifford Leaves Show  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Next up for Regis Philbin: ''Who Wants to Be
Kathie Lee?''
</P>
<P>
   His daytime partner for the past 15 years, Kathie Lee Gifford,
surprised viewers of ''Live with Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee'' on Tuesday
with the announcement that she's quitting this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The program's syndicators, Buena Vista Television, quickly made
it known that the show will go on.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to have a wonderful time seeing this parade of
contestants go by, who want to get this job,'' Gifford told
Philbin. ''I can see you salivating right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buena Vista may not be in such a hurry to replace Gifford,
whose contract runs out in August. One possibility is a wave of
short-time co-hosts, in something of a public audition for the job.
Philbin has also worked morning television shows alone.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin has publicly eclipsed his co-star in recent months with
the phenomenal success of ABC's prime-time sensation, ''Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire.'' He's about to strike a new deal to continue
as host of the game show and extend his stay on the daytime talk
show, one that will reportedly pay him $20 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   He loyally stuck with Gifford through her tabloid scandals, bad
wardrobe days and endless talk about her son, Cody.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford, who recently performed a fill-in role in the Broadway
musical ''Putting it Together'' and was guest host last week for
David Letterman's ''Late Show,'' said she misses singing and acting
and wants to ''spread my creative wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin and Gifford first began working together in 1985 on the
morning show, then aired only in New York City. It became
syndicated for a national audience in 1988, and now ranks a solid
fourth in the talk show derby behind Oprah Winfrey, Jerry Springer
and Rosie O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   Their light mix of celebrity chat and entertainment begins each
morning with Philbin and Gifford looking at the day's news, or
talking about what they did the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford said that's part of what has driven her away. After
years of talking on the air about Cody, 10, and her daughter
Cassidy, 7, she doesn't want them as the subject of attention
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I no longer feel comfortable sharing the ordinary, innocent,
everyday details of my family life, only to watch the tabloid media
turn them into harmful, misleading and libelous stories,'' she
said. Cody is, however, making his acting debut in a Disney movie
airing March 12 on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Although its ratings are down about 10 percent this year, most
talk shows have seen their viewership decline. ''Live with Regis &AMP;
Kathie Lee'' is attractive to advertisers because it is
entertaining and non-controversial, said Richard Kurlander, an
expert in TV syndication for Petry Television.
</P>
<P>
   While it would have trouble surviving without Philbin, Gifford
can be replaced, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has her positives,'' Kurlander said, ''but she also has
her negatives. I would think this is a good opportunity to inject
some new blood.''

<HEADLINE> More Donate Organs While Alive  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kyle McNamara watched a co-worker succumbing
to liver failure and did what he thinks anyone would do -- he
donated a piece of his liver. ''After talking to the surgeons and
really getting the information, it really wasn't a hard decision,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others might be more hesitant, but McNamara is part of a growing
group of living donors. In particular, organ donations from people
who are not related to the recipients have tripled over the past
year, as the waiting lists have grown and transplantation
techniques have improved.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the number of living donors giving up a kidney or,
increasingly, a section of their livers, has more than doubled over
the past decade, according to a report released Tuesday by the
United Network for Organ Sharing, which runs the nation's
transplant system.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just something anyone in my group would do,'' said
McNamara, 32, of Braintree, Mass.. He donated part of his liver to
Randy Roberts, a friend, but not a lifelong buddy or close
confidant.
</P>
<P>
   More often, the donor is a relative -- someone like Andrew
Kennedy, who donated a part of his liver to his mother. She had six
months to live, and the doctors told her she'd never make it to the
top of the long waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first I said no,'' said Mrs. Kennedy, 62, of Niverville,
N.Y. ''He said, 'Ma, you can't do that to me.' He said, 'You gave
me life and now it's my turn to repay it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Four months after the surgery, both Kennedys are doing well.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there were 4,273 living donors in 1998, up from
1,918 a decade earlier, the organ-sharing network said. In 1998,
one in five donated organs came from a living donor.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 18 percent of the living donors were unrelated to the
recipients -- mostly close friends and co-workers, with an
occasional stranger. About 40 percent were siblings, 20 percent
parents, 16 percent offspring and 7 percent other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Donations from people who have died -- called cadaveric donors --
have also increased, though not as dramatically, and only because
there's been an increase in the number of older donors. Donors over
age 50 now account for 29 percent of all cadaveric donors.
</P>
<P>
   All told, there were 5,798 cadaveric donors in 1998, up about 6
percent from 1997 and about 45 percent since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in 1998, 4,860 people died while waiting for a
transplant, triple what it was a decade earlier. The number of
people on the waiting list also tripled, to 64,373 by the end of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the waiting list tops 68,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those bleak numbers make people more interested in helping out,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Family members are more inclined to ask (about donating),
seeing their loved one progressing before their eyes and knowing
they're still a long way from being at the top of the list,'' said
Dr. Elizabeth Pomfret, director of the live donor liver transplant
program at Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Living kidney donors have been around for a long time -- the
first transplant ever performed was a kidney moved from one twin
brother to another in 1954. People are born with two kidneys but
only need one to function.
</P>
<P>
   Living liver donors are newer, particularly between adults. For
years, doctors have transplanted a small piece of an adult liver
into a child. Now, increasingly, they are transplanting larger
sections into other adults. The partial livers in each person
regenerate and grow into full livers. As the technique has
improved, the numbers have grown.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is accumulating that kidneys from living donors do
better in their new bodies than kidneys from cadaveric donors,
partly because the organ is outside the body for a shorter time
before transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   With those results, doctors are more willing to consider donors
who are not related to the recipient, though every donor must go
through a full psychological evaluation to be sure they have not
been coerced in any way and that they are not being paid.	   The shortage of
organs -- combined with medical experience -- also
account for the increase in older, deceased donors. Conventional
wisdom once held that donors over 55 or 60 did not have usable
organs. That's no longer true, especially for livers and kidneys,
said Howard Nathan, director of the Gift of Life Donor Program in
Philadelphia, where they regularly procure organs from older
donors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ten years ago, some donors would not have been considered for
transplantation just on a gut reaction,'' he said. ''We now find
donors as old as 80 can be used safely.''

<HEADLINE> Broadway Theater To Be Renamed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Next to the historic Broadway theaters named for
famous actors, playwrights, producers and arts patrons, the new
American Airlines Theater has landed.
</P>
<P>
   In an $8.5 million, 10-year deal, the non-profit Roundabout
Theater Company plans to rename the Selwyn Theater on 42nd Street
for the airline, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for American to provide $850,000 a year to the
theatre to help underwrite the Roundabout's operations. The
theatre, built in 1918 by Arch and Edgar Selwyn, has been
undergoing a $21 million renovation over the past two years and is
to reopen April 11.
</P>
<P>
   Similar changes are afoot at the Winter Garden Theater, where
''Cats'' has played for nearly 18 years. The theater's owner, the
Shubert Organization, is in talks with General Motors about a deal
that could turn it into the Cadillac Theater or the Cadillac Winter
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners said such alliances could become widespread and
lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to change both the face and the economics of
Broadway,'' said Lindsey Gruson, of STET, a marketing group that
has advised the Shubert Organization on the Cadillac deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some traditionalists were concerned about corporations buying
their way onto the marquees, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Walter Kerr still sounds a lot better to me than 'the
AT&AMP;T,''' said Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn, which owns
five Broadway theaters.

<HEADLINE> Rediscovering Nat 'King' Cole  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES J. GANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When a new king, Elvis Presley, dethroned him
from the top of the pop charts, Nat ''King'' Cole didn't become
bitter or try to turn himself into something he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the changing fashions, he simply added the satirical
''Mr. Cole Won't Rock and Roll'' to his nightclub act in the late
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Carol Cole admits she was surprised when she heard
her father would be among the inductees Monday to the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ''My initial reaction was that I was somewhat shocked, but that
was before I understood that he was being inducted as an early
influence, and then it made a lot of sense,'' said Cole, who
administers her father's estate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It obviously relates to his trio days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame is not inducting the Nat ''King'' Cole most
people remember: Not the suave crooner whose recordings of such
ballads as ''Mona Lisa'' and ''Nature Boy'' endure 35 years after
his death from lung cancer. Not daughter Natalie's posthumous
singing partner in 1991's Grammy-winning ''Unforgettable'' and last
year's ''The Christmas Song.'' Not the man whose songs are heard in
dozens of films (''Sleepless in Seattle,'' ''As Good As It Gets''),
TV shows (''Ally McBeal'' and ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'') and
ad campaigns (Acura, BMW and MCI) from the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Hall of Fame is honoring the Nat ''King'' Cole who
until recently was largely forgotten: the hip pianist and singer
whose drummerless trio with bass and guitar was one of the most
popular and innovative small jazz combos of the 1940s, an influence
on future generations of jazz and rhythm and blues artists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that Nat 'King' Cole should have been inducted a long
time ago, but I'm glad we finally got around to it,'' said Seymour
Stein, president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and founder of
Sire Records.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say that his career in rhythm and blues was as strong
if not stronger than his later career in pop,'' Stein said.
''Without question, the main component of rock 'n' roll was rhythm
and blues ... and Nat Cole was one of the top R&AMP;B artists of all
time.''
</P>
<P>
   After Cole stood up from the piano bench to sing and abandoned
his trio in the early 1950s, its memory gradually faded. Jazz
purists felt betrayed when Cole turned to pop, and he received only
passing mention in jazz reference books. For decades, his trio
recordings were practically unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   But Carole Cole said the trio remained at ''the core of
everything my father did even after he crossed over'' to become a
pop superstar in front of large orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always believed that's where his heart remained, which isn't
to say he didn't enjoy and excel in being a pop singer,'' she said.
''In clubs and concerts, there was always a moment in the show when
he would say, 'And now for you music lovers,' and then he'd sit
down at the piano and jam with primarily a trio.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the Cole trio has enjoyed a renaissance.
There has been a steady outpouring of recordings, from the
Grammy-winning 18-CD ''The Complete Capitol Recordings of the Nat
'King' Cole Trio'' (Mosaic) in 1991 to the recently released ''Live
at the Circle Room'' (Capitol Jazz), a rare document of a live club
date from 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Cole says more releases are planned as the Capitol vaults
yield up more treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the brightest stars on the contemporary jazz scene,
including Diana Krall and John Pizzarelli, have acknowledged their
debt with recordings that re-create the Cole trio's instrumentation
and reinterpret its repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   And a new biography, ''Nat King Cole,'' by Daniel Mark Epstein,
published last fall by Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, is the most
definitive to date and does much to set the record straight about
Cole's formative years and contribution to jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is that Nat's pop music was so huge that it eclipsed
the jazz music,'' said Epstein, in an interview. ''There was a
certain amount of snobbism in the world of criticism ... that if a
man or woman is popular then they couldn't possibly be great.''
</P>
<P>
   In looking closely at Cole's pre-pop jazz career -- as a
triple-threat pianist, singer and small combo leader -- Epstein
concluded that he deserves to be ranked among the first tier of
jazz greats, alongside Louis Armstrong or John Coltrane.
</P>
<P>
   The biography describes how Cole's father, a Baptist minister,
brought his family from Alabama to Chicago during the great black
migration of the 1920s. Cole's mother taught him gospel on the
piano so he could play in his father's church. But the precocious
boy was soon sneaking out at night to stand outside clubs and
listen to Armstrong, Earl ''Fatha'' Hines and other legends from
the Golden Age of Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The biography re-creates one night at the Savoy Ballroom in 1935
when the 16-year-old, then known as ''Schoolboy'' Cole, more than
held his own against Hines in a battle of the bands. Hines, who
Epstein says ''brought into jazz piano playing the complexity of
the European musical tradition,'' was Cole's first major influence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nat struggled to play as fast, as richly and inventively as
Earl Hines, and in the process discovered his own voice,'' said
Epstein. ''Nat is much more of a poet, a lyricist. Hines creates
these huge rather complex structures, and Nat pares down all that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nat becomes the pianist who in the late '30s and early '40s
creates the link between the Golden Age of Jazz and the bebop era --
mainly by knowing what to leave out in his playing. Bud Powell,
Thelonious Monk and Oscar Peterson were all very much influenced by
Nat. He was a key figure -- one of the five greatest jazz
pianists.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Cole's greatest contribution to jazz -- creating the
modern trio format -- came about through a combination of luck and
economic necessity when the 18-year-old pianist found himself
stranded in Los Angeles in 1937 after a touring show fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   A nightclub owner offered him a gig for a small group -- with a
bassist, guitarist and drummer -- and then the drummer bowed out
because the bandstand was too tiny. Cole hired two musicians
recommended by Lionel Hampton: guitarist Oscar Moore and bassist
Wesley Prince.
</P>
<P>
   He shaped a new ensemble sound using what had been thought of in
jazz orchestras as three rhythm instruments. Cole found the perfect
musical companion in Moore, an early innovator on the then-new
electric guitar. When bassist Johnny Miller joined the trio in
1942, after Prince was drafted, Cole had the classic group that
would help establish the fledgling Capitol label. They had a string
of hits, starting with ''Straighten Up and Fly Right'' in 1943, in
which Cole's singing became ever more prominent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the most amazing aspect of the trio was that it was
the first drummerless jazz group of any note and they swung
incessantly. No drummer could have helped them swing any harder,''
said record producer Michael Cuscuna, who oversaw the release of
the limited edition ''Complete Capitol Recordings'' in 1991, and
nearly a dozen Capitol CDs since then that showcase Cole's jazzier
side.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been sad if they had just stayed a footnote in
history,'' Cuscuna said. ''But now I think the group is really here
to stay as much as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie.''
</P>
<P>
   The trio's legacy, however, is more than a collection of
reissued archival recordings. Its influence can be heard in the
music played by a new jazz generation.
</P>
<P>
   Pianist-singer Krall, whose newest recording, ''When I Look in
Your Eyes,'' is the first jazz CD to receive a Grammy nomination
for Album of the Year since 1988, made her breakthrough with her
1996 album, ''All for You,'' a dedication to the Cole trio of the
1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've listened to Nat Cole since I was 12 years old, sometimes
on a daily basis,'' Krall said. ''His trio influenced all of the
people I've admired and learned from, like Oscar Peterson, Bill
Evans and Ahmad Jamal. Nat Cole is all over pretty much everything
I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Guitarist-singer Pizzarelli got introduced to Cole through his
father, veteran jazz guitarist Bucky Pizzarelli, who led his own
trio with piano, bass and guitar. The younger Pizzarelli has put
his stamp on the Cole trio repertoire with two tribute albums,
1994's ''Dear Mr. Cole'' and ''P.S. Mr. Cole,'' released in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no me without Nat 'King' Cole,'' said Pizzarelli,
whose new recording, ''Kisses in the Rain,'' again features
standards from the classic American songbook played by his
piano-guitar-bass trio.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing dated about the trio's music,'' Pizzarelli
said. ''The songs sound just as if he had made them yesterday
afternoon in the studio.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 59.45; Dow Down 24.51  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors once again
poured money into technology shares and halted their two-day fling
with blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the technology-dominated
Nasdaq composite index was up 59.45 at 4,756.14, topping the new
closing record of 4,696.69 set Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 24.51 at 10,103.80,
having given up an early gain of as much as 50 points. The decline
reversed a two-day rally during which the blue-chip index recovered
regained 266 of the 357 points it lost last week.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 8.30 at 1,374.72.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of relatively broad gains on Wall Street, the
market reverted to its familiar divergent pattern, with technology
stocks leaping higher while old-line industrial stocks slid.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's strongest performer was SBC Communications, which rose
3 to 41 1/16 amid reports the company will combine its wireless
phone operations with those of BellSouth. That would allow the
companies to compete with rivals with nationwide wireless networks.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth rose 1] to 41 15/16 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from SBC, most Dow components were lower as investors
remained wary of blue-chip companies' prospects in an environment
of rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve has raised interest
rates four times since last June, hoping to slow economic growth
enough to stave off inflation.
</P>
<P>
   After Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested last month that
central bankers remain poised to raise rates further, investors
found little reason to buy blue chips, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''His hawkish interest rate comments have folks running from
stocks that borrow a lot of money and are heavily affected by
overall economic activity,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market
strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. ''This depression among the
old-economy stocks has caused the manic buying of the new-economy
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors believe that fast-growing technology companies,
which tend to be investor-financed and borrow less than more
established firms, are in the best position to withstand rising
rates that can erode corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are also hoping that the rapid growth of most
technology companies will allow them to outpace old-economy
companies, no matter how high interest rates may rise.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, any company that appears poised to take advantage
of technology has fared well in recent months. Today, Lucent
Technology rose 11 41/64 to 71\ after announcing plans to spin off
the units that sell corporate phone systems and make wire cabling
for office networks.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, 3Com rose 7[ to 105[ and Sun Microsystems rose 3\
to 98{.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 567.42 million
shares, well ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.08 to 584.79.

   Camryn Manheim won an Emmy for her role in ''The Practice'' and
was cast as Snow White for NBC's ''The 10th Kingdom,'' a 10-hour
miniseries. But Manheim, who was born on March 8, 1961, says she
still can't command immediate acceptance by the movie world. ''I
thought it would be easier, but it's not; I am fighting for every
little thing,'' the plus-size actress said. ''I still have to
audition for parts that have two scenes, six lines in each scene. I
have decided to produce my own movie so I can prove I can play a
leading role. I have to take the risk because people aren't taking
risks on me.''
</P>

   When he was 13, James Van Der Beek of the WB's ''Dawson's
Creek'' landed a lead role in a local production of ''Grease.'' He
continued to do children's theater in his hometown of Cheshire,
Conn. After deciding to pursue acting professionally, he was cast
in the off-Broadway play ''Finding the Sun,'' written and directed
by Edward Albee. His first film performance came in 1995, with a
starring role in ''Angus.'' Now his career is on a roll. Van Der
Beek, who was born on March 8, 1977, stars with Rachael Leigh Cook
in the upcoming film ''Texas Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   He caught Hollywood's eye with the teen hit ''She's All That.''
Now Freddie Prinze Jr. stars in the new movie ''Down to You'' with
Julia Stiles. ''I make movies for the same reason I think people go
to see movies. To escape reality for a while,'' he said. ''It's the
only place where I can fly the spaceship, pitch the winning game,
and get the girl and live happily ever after.'' Prinze, who was
born on March 8, 1976, is the son of the late Freddie Prinze, who
starred in the 1970s sitcom ''Chico and the Man.''

<P>
   No, the reigning queen of teen pop isn't going to Disneyland,
but that's very close. The Disney Channel is where we'll see her
next, when she kicks off the network's new music documentary series
''2 Hour Tour'' on March 11. Each week, a major artist will
audition a series of bands, then pick one to be an opening act,
showing the group the ropes in the world of big-time pop music.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so funny, I just keep coming back to Disney for different
projects and they bear no relation to one another, they just sort
of happen,'' said the former Mouseketeer, whose big break came with
the hit song ''Reflection'' from the 1998 Disney film ''Mulan.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been such a strong building point in my career,'' added
Aguilera, who sounds just as perky on the phone as she did during
her Grammy acceptance speech and who -- as she did on Grammy night --
can lapse into occasional Valley-Girl speak when discussing a new
project. Witness her description of her work with Disney: ''Each
thing is really, really cool. Doing this two-hour thing is really,
really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't sell her short. Aguilera, described often by critics
as having the best voice among the current crop of teen-age
heartthrobs, began preparing for that best new artist Grammy more
than a decade ago. Now she is looking ahead to a career as a
songwriter, and her next album, a collection of songs in Spanish
due out in the fall, will reflect her Latin heritage. (Her father
is from Ecuador.)
</P>
<P>
   1. First for the obvious question. You won a Grammy less than 24
hours ago. How are you feeling right now?
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera (giggling): Amazing. I'm having one of the best days
I've had in a long time. I'm still like floating on air since last
night. God, I didn't expect it at all. I worked really hard, I
worked really, really hard on my career this year and it was good
to be recognized for it last night. That was my very first trip to
the Grammys. I never even went as a spectator or anything. This was
the first year for me and I was totally not expecting it. Not
expecting anything. ... And you know, whenever you prepare yourself
to not get something, to be humble in losing, and then you actually
get it, that moment is so surreal for you.
</P>
<P>
   2. Going back to when you were a Mouseketeer, and even before
that, when you appeared on ''Star Search,'' did you ever envision
being at the Grammys?
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera: On yes, oh yes. Even younger. I totally have been
watching the Grammys since 8 years old or whenever that was that I
was on 'Star Search.' I watched Mariah Carey win that best new
artist award and I thought of that award and I thought that one day
that's the award I would love to get. ... And then to follow in her
footsteps and then grow up and receive the award. I was really
happy. Hopefully, I'll keep working hard now to ensure the
longevity of my career.
</P>
<P>
   3. Are you planning to write more songs for your next album?
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera: Right now I'm writing, getting lots of ideas together.
I want to make lyrical content more personal, more about my
responses to things I've been through, showing different sides of
me that people haven't seen yet.
</P>
<P>
   4. With all that's happened, has there been time for a boyfriend
or settling down?
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera: My career is my boyfriend. Actually, I fell in love
this year for the first time in the midst of all this. I don't know
how it happened. It's kind of crazy. It's really, really hard to
maintain a relationship being in the spotlight constantly and
people are always digging for things, and considering the
long-distance factor and how busy I am, it's a strain on any
relationship. So we'll see. We'll see what happens in the future.
</P>
<P>
   5. This being the last question, let's make it a silly one: What
does a girl want?
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera: As cheesy as it sounds, I'm seriously still working on
a driver's license. I still don't have one. That's one thing I'm
concentrating on right now. That and finding an apartment in L.A.
because I've actually moved out now. ... I had a couple of
apartments in New York earlier this year, earlier on, but I moved
out of those because I was on the road so much. I've been pretty
much living out of suitcases and hotels. ... So I'm really looking
forward to getting an apartment in L.A. and a sports car and all
that cute stuff.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Lorrie Morgan  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tammy Wynette, who died in 1998, had
picked Lorrie Morgan as her successor as the pre-eminent voice for
women in country music.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never told anybody that she told me that,'' said Morgan
during an interview, with a sense of awe in her voice. ''She
invited me to her house for chicken and dumplings. She told me ...
'You are THE ONE to carry on the flame.'
</P>
<P>
   ''And I was like, I can never tell anybody that. They'll think
I'm lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Wynette, Morgan is an earthy, beautiful blonde whose
singing voice can make a happy country song a bit melancholy and a
sad one nearly unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   At 40, Morgan is at a crossroad in her career.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when Nashville seems to introduce a new teen-age
Shania Twain wannabe every week, she is leaving RCA Records and has
taken on entertainment industry powerhouse Irving Azoff as her
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Among Azoff's clients are the Eagles and Don Henley as a solo
artist. Morgan hopes Azoff can help her launch a film career and
pick a record company that is committed to keeping a veteran on the
charts.
</P>
<P>
   But before she rushes into the future, Morgan recorded five new
songs for RCA, the hits collection ''To Get to You.'' All the songs
speak to the experiences of modern women.
</P>
<P>
   Spanning her work back to 1988, the CD is rife with women
scorned (''Good as I Was to You''), women struggling to save their
marriages (''Maybe Not Tonight''), and women needing to blow off
some steam (''One of Those Nights Tonight'').
</P>
<P>
   There's a remake of the Wynette classic ''Another Lonely Song,''
about a woman enduring a long night while her lover is in another's
arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoop-de-do,'' written by Angela Kaset and Craig Carothers,
puts down older men who use young girlfriends as trophies. ''You
gonna help her with her homework later/Then brag to all your
friends/'Bout how you scored again,'' she taunts in the song.
</P>
<P>
   Her children and ex-husband Jon Randall, a country singer,
suggested ''Angel'' by Sarah McLachlan. It works wonderfully as a
country song.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women deal with a lot, and that's what Tammy knew,'' said
Morgan, casual in Calvin Klein overalls and lighting the first of
several cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''She knew that we have to be that saint on Sunday morning and
the devil on Saturday night. But in the meantime, be sure the kids
have their homework, be sure you've got the meals cooked and the
clothes are ironed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Be sure you look good, your hips aren't too fat, but yet
you're not too skinny. Women have a lot on us, and Tammy got it.
And that's what I want to be to the next generation, if that makes
any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan grew up around show business as the fifth child of
Country Music Hall of Famer George Morgan. She idolized Wynette,
Jeannie Seely and Connie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   After debuting on the Grand Ole Opry at 13, she worked for years
to establish herself as a hitmaker. She finally scored her first
Top 10 hits in 1989, but the breakthrough was marred by the death
of her husband, country music great Keith Whitley.
</P>
<P>
   She has been married three other times, twice to musicians and
once to a bus driver. Morgan's two children are Jesse Keith
Whitley, 12, and Morgan Anastasia Gaddis, 19.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said she feels much like any other 40-year-old divorcee,
struggling to balance a career, dating and motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a country singer, but I'm a woman, and I'm a lover, and
I've been a wife, and I've been a friend, and I've been a mom,''
she said. ''All us women go through the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to sing those songs for women that give us a little bit
of strength to make one more bed, mop one more floor, wipe one more
dirty nose, and still be able to dress up.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynette would be proud.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost a dedication that I'm going to carry the tradition
of country music and the tradition of the great ladies of country
music on, until I hit a brick wall,'' Morgan said. ''And then when
I hit the wall, I'm just going to chisel through it.''

<HEADLINE> When Anonymity Brings Celebrity  </HEADLINE>
By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Andy Warhol said everyone gets 15 minutes of
fame.
</P>
<P>
   Journalist Rene Chun and filmmaker Christopher Herrmann have
extended their time in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ''My brush with celebrity might have lasted 17 minutes,'' the
41-year-old Chun said.
</P>
<P>
   Chun and Herrmann are two of the ''every men'' selected for
Chanel's Allure Homme advertising campaign, which also features a
hotelier, conductor, professional hockey player, jazz musician,
surfer, professional polo player and Olympic medalist.
</P>
<P>
   Although well-known in their professional circles, the Allure
men are identified only by their occupations and hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't keep them anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Herrmann, 36, didn't tell anyone he was going to appear in the
ads. But family and friends had no trouble recognizing him when his
photo began appearing in magazine and newspaper ads and on
billboards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single person I ever came in contact with in my whole
life, and any person who is in contact with my immediate family of
10, got in contact with me again. And it's still happening,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chun said the first time he saw the ad on the back cover of
Esquire magazine, he was both giddy and embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to be recognized,'' he said. ''There are certain
perks. I used to never get good seats in restaurants, I get that
now. And your social standing in Manhattan goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a year into the Allure for Men ad campaign, Chun said he is
still surprised when someone notices his picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had done a very heavy, hard-core journalism story about
bioterrorism for George magazine. A friend called up and said, 'I
loved you in George magazine.''' Chun recalled. ''I said, 'Oh,
thank you. Thank you. What did you think?' And she went on and on,
saying, 'It's so beautiful. The layout is wonderful.'
</P>
<P>
   ''And then I realized she was talking about the ad.''
</P>
<P>
   What landed him a high-profile modeling job is a mystery to
Chun. All he knows is that a fashion-industry friend recommended
him because ''he's not short, not a hunchback, and he still has a
full head of hair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will run through the end of the year when a new batch of
''every men'' will be selected. Chanel is planning to use the same
concept for its upcoming ads for Allure fragrance for women.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so weird how one picture can get out there and change so
much. Even friends changed because my picture is in a magazine.
They treat me like I'm a celebrity,'' said Herrmann, whose MANNIC
Productions company just completed a film on dance pioneer Martha
Graham. ''Ghost Light'' is slated for release later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chun, who interviews celebrities for Details and InStyle
magazines, said he now challenges stars on what he calls the ''big
Hollywood lie'' when they complain about fame.
</P>
<P>
   Herrmann believes his Allure photo makes him look more serious
than he really is.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little austere for my personality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Herrmann added, the shadowed black-and-white photo is very
similar to Alfred Hitchcock's style, which he admires.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy that shot this is very talented,'' said Chun as he
gazed at his photo. ''It's a glamour shot.'' Chun wore his hair
slicked back for the first time for his photo. It was also the
first time he had worn a skintight black Gucci turtleneck.
</P>
<P>
   Herrmann did a quick ''walk-by'' of a bus shelter after he
learned that his ad was posted there. And Chanel sent his parents a
photo of him standing at the bus shelter next to his likeness.
</P>
<P>
   Chun's mother keeps the ad in her purse so that she can show it
to her friends.
</P>
<P>
   And Chun received the ultimate compliment from a professional
model.
</P>
<P>
   ''She looked at it and just said, 'You nailed it,''' he said,
recalling his wife's reaction the first time she saw the photo.

<HEADLINE> Britain Nominates 'American Beauty'  </HEADLINE>
By MATT WOLF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- ''American Beauty,'' the most nominated film in
this month's Oscar race, led the pack Wednesday at the British
Academy Film and Television Awards, with 14 nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The nominations included best picture and best director for
first-time filmmaker Sam Mendes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The End of the Affair'' and ''The Talented Mr. Ripley''
received 10 and seven nominations, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   All three films will compete for best picture alongside Oscar
nominee ''The Sixth Sense'' and ''East Is East,'' a low-budget
British hit adapted from a play by Ayub Khan-Din. The latter movie
opens April 14 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The BAFTA winners will be announced April 9, two weeks after the
March 26 Oscars. In the United States, ''American Beauty'' is up
for eight Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ''East Is East'' received five British nominations, as did
''Topsy-Turvy,'' Mike Leigh's detailed and affectionate chronicle
of the making of the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta ''The Mikado.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather surprisingly, Leigh -- an Englishman much-loved by his
countrymen -- was not named for best director, despite receiving
that award from two of the main four U.S. critics' organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Many nominees for the British awards also are up for Oscars,
including ''American Beauty'' leads Kevin Spacey and Annette
Bening, Russell Crowe of ''The Insider,'' and Julianne Moore for
''The End of the Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore and Bening face up for best actress alongside Emily Watson
(''Angela's Ashes'') and Linda Bassett (''East Is East'').
</P>
<P>
   The best actor race includes Spacey and Crowe, as well as Ralph
Fiennes (''The End of the Affair''), Om Puri (''East Is East'') and
veteran British character actor Jim Broadbent (''Topsy-Turvy''),
who plays a wonderfully gruff, blustery W.S. Gilbert in the Leigh
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Broadbent and Fiennes were overlooked by the American academy,
as were BAFTA supporting actor nominee Wes Bentley (''American
Beauty'') and director Anthony Minghella (''The Talented Mr.
Ripley'').
</P>
<P>
   The foreign film lineup pits Oscar favorite ''All About My
Mother,'' Pedro Almodovar's much-acclaimed Spanish movie, against
Germany's ''Run Lola Run,'' Denmark's ''Festen'' and Wim Wenders'
''Buena Vista Social Club,'' which explores the music and musicians
of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The British awards also have two separate categories for best
film and best British film. Competing for the latter prize are
''East Is East,'' ''Topsy-Turvy,'' ''Ratcatcher,'' ''Onegin,''
''Notting Hill'' and ''Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial powerhouse ''Notting Hill'' received further
nominations for supporting actor Rhys Ifans, playing Hugh Grant's
slob of a housemate, and for the Orange Audience Award, which is
chosen by the public.

<HEADLINE> MS Study Aided by Marijuana  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX DOMINGUEZ , Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marijuana-like compounds ease tremors in mice with a condition
similar to multiple sclerosis, researchers say in a study that
appears to corroborate patients who say pot helps them deal with
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The relief apparently wasn't because the mice were stoned, but
because the compounds hit the right buttons in the nervous system,
the British researchers reported in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The compounds tested were synthetic but included the chemical
equivalent of THC, the main ingredient in marijuana. Five of the
six compounds tested reduced tremors and spasticity.
</P>
<P>
   ''This lends credence to the anecdotal reports that some people
with MS have said that cannabis can help control these distressing
symptoms,'' said Lorna Layward, one of the study's authors. Layward
heads the research arm of the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Reingold, vice president of research at the National
Multiple Sclerosis Society, said it would be wrong to assume the
results would hold true for humans. He said further research should
be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this doesn't tell us is that smoking marijuana is good
for MS,'' Reingold said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 Americans have MS, in which the body attacks
myelin, the sheath that insulates nerve fibers. That can produce
stiffness, tremors, paralysis, loss of vision, numbness and pain.
The cause is unknown, and there is no cure.
</P>
<P>
   In the new work, the compounds injected into the mice stimulated
structures called cannabinoid receptors on the surface of nerve
cells. The work indicates the receptors are involved in the
regulation of muscle tone, said David Baker of University College
in London, who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms were not eased merely by the sedative effect of
cannabinoids, since some of the compounds don't bind with the
receptor known to be responsible for marijuana's high. Other signs
of sedation, such as a drop in body temperature, also were not
found, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the work could lead to compounds that can treat MS
symptoms without the high of marijuana, which can affect memory.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've tapped into and exposed this natural system,'' he said.
''And that's why this is important.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of marijuana in treating illness has been the subject
of debate, with some states passing laws allowing its use for
medicinal purposes. Some patients with AIDS, glaucoma and cancer
say marijuana can ease pain, nausea and other symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Layward said other researchers in Britain are planning to test
marijuana derivatives on MS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Lisak, co-director of the Multiple Sclerosis Center
at the Detroit Medical Center, said the mouse disease is not
exactly analogous to multiple sclerosis in humans, but the work is
encouraging.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 65.31; Dow Down 13.03  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors once again
poured money into technology shares and halted their two-day fling
with blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the technology-dominated
Nasdaq composite index was up 65.31 at 4,762.00, topping the
closing record of 4,696.69 it set Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 13.03 at 10,115.28,
having given up an early gain of as much as 50 points. The decline
reversed a two-day rally during which the blue-chip index recovered
regained 266 of the 357 points it lost last week.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 5.97 at 1,372.39.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of relatively broad gains on Wall Street, the
market reverted to its familiar divergent pattern, with technology
stocks leaping higher while old-line industrial stocks slid.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's strongest performer was SBC Communications, which rose
2 15/16 to 41 amid reports the company will combine its wireless
phone operations with those of BellSouth. That would allow the
companies to compete with rivals with nationwide wireless networks.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth rose 1\ to 41 13/16 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from SBC, most Dow components were lower as investors
remained wary of blue-chip companies' prospects in an environment
of rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve has raised interest
rates four times since last June, hoping to slow economic growth
enough to stave off inflation.
</P>
<P>
   After Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested last month that
central bankers remain poised to raise rates further, investors
found little reason to buy blue chips, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''His hawkish interest rate comments have folks running from
stocks that borrow a lot of money and are heavily affected by
overall economic activity,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market
strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. ''This depression among the
old-economy stocks has caused the manic buying of the new-economy
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors believe that fast-growing technology companies,
which tend to be investor-financed and borrow less than more
established firms, are in the best position to withstand rising
rates that can erode corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are also hoping that the rapid growth of most
technology companies will allow them to outpace old-economy
companies, no matter how high interest rates may rise.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, any company that appears poised to take advantage
of technology has fared well in recent months. Today, Lucent
Technology rose 11 41/64 to 71\ after announcing plans to spin off
the units that sell corporate phone systems and make wire cabling
for office networks.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, 3Com rose 7[ to 105[ and Sun Microsystems rose 2
15/16 to 98 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Reports released today did little to suggest that the Fed's
inflation worries are over. The National Association of Purchasing
Management said the prices paid for manufacturing supplies shot up
to a new five-year high. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said
spending on construction projects jumped by 2.7 percent in January,
the biggest increase in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 835.37 million
shares, well ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 9.32 to 587.03.

<HEADLINE> Wild Color, Glitz Prevail at Ungaro  </HEADLINE>
By SUZY PATTERSON, AP Fashion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Wild color and glitz ruled the runway at Emanuel
Ungaro's show of boutique ready-to-wear on Wednesday. The
collection underscored the current Paris fashion mood, which is
like the stock market -- highs of rich splurges and a few cautionary
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it's back to the Eighties.
</P>
<P>
   Ungaro's cropped or long pants outfits were made of pinstriped
wool, sometimes topped with a glittery, sequined leather blouson.
</P>
<P>
   Short pinstriped tailored coats were ideal for any investment
banker, though she might pair a coat with Ungaro's red and black
print slim pants for evening.
</P>
<P>
   After a few conservative outfits, livened by stiletto-heeled
clear plastic and gold pumps or sandals, or a ruffled red
transparent blouse, the show went into blazing party goods.
</P>
<P>
   There were pointed-hemmed, tiered dresses, some in beaded black,
others in shades of purple and chartreuse silk.
</P>
<P>
   The red crepe mini-dress would be great at a disco; so would a
green mohair sweater decked with coins.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Lacroix also went wild for exuberant glitz in his show
at the Cirque d'Hiver, or Winter Circus hall. And he showed silky
multicolored T-shirts topping the slimmest of stretch jeans.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate it, one must first get past the Betty Boop
babydoll hairdos with shiny bows on the models.
</P>
<P>
   All of Lacroix's artistic yearnings came out in long, hot pink,
flounced organza skirts, painted T-shirts and evening gowns printed
with swirls. Some might love the high-collared, bowed-front
turquoise gold brocade coat.
</P>
<P>
   Stella McCartney showed for Chloe at the Opera, where she
started out, and her young fans should be happy with the offering.
</P>
<P>
   It's sure that her father, Beatle Paul, is proud. He was joined
by Jerry Seinfeld and Sean Lennon in the celebrity ranks applauding
Stella.
</P>
<P>
   While there was nothing to set fashion on its ear, the clothes,
based vaguely on '70s and '80s ideas, looked fine for today.
</P>
<P>
   Sparkly, sequined, light mini-dresses with argyll or diamond
patterns were topped with fake-fur maxi-coats.
</P>
<P>
   Colors were pleasantly toned down: light grays in diamond
patterns for chiffon mini-dresses, boots and even brimmed hats.
</P>
<P>
   Low-slung trousers looked good with a slight flare. In contrast,
some coats and jackets had sharp regimental military stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful art deco or fantasy beading on dressy tops for jeans
looked fine for the generation that likes to mix dressy-casual
styles. Hand-cut sequin and feather effects dressed up a couple of
coats.
</P>
<P>
   Color was definitely not Alexander McQueen's idea for Givenchy.
Showing at the Cinematheque near the Trocadero, he started out with
muddy khakis and just kept going. The opposite of the glitz +shown
elsewhere, this show was strictly based on the hard-edge side of
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   There were well-cut hipster pants, brown clinging pullovers and
zip-up mini-dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of skin was bared by the minis and cut outs. Beautiful
jackets or shiny patent leather tunics were shown with colored
tights.
</P>
<P>
   When color came out, it was in a low-waisted, flared plaid skirt
in blues and browns, topped by a demure puffed-sleeve white blouse
and white leather tie.
</P>
<P>
   The best in the show was McQueen himself. He wheeled down the
runway on a scooter to take his bow -- just like the kids do at the
nearby Trocadero.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 76.29; Dow Up 12.10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Soaring telecommunications and technology stocks
pushed the Nasdaq composite index further into record territory
today and helped the Dow Jones industrials cling to a modest gain.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was up 76.29 at
4,772.98, topping the closing record of 4,696.69 it set Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 12.10 at 10,140.41,
slipping back and forth between gains and losses. The Dow was
struggling to extend a two-day rally in which the index regained
266 of the 357 points it lost last week.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 8.76 at 1,375.18.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of relatively broad gains on Wall Street, the
market reverted to its familiar divergent pattern, with technology
stocks leaping higher while old-line industrial stocks slid.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lucent Technology rose 9 25/64 to 69 on the New York
Stock Exchange after announcing plans to spin off the units that
sell corporate phone systems and make wire cabling for office
networks.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, 3Com rose 10 15/16 to 105 5/16 and Sun
Microsystems rose 3 19/64 to 98 35/64.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's strongest performer was SBC Communications, which rose
2 13/16 to 40~ amid reports the company will combine its wireless
phone operations with those of BellSouth. That would allow the
companies to compete with rivals with nationwide wireless networks.
BellSouth rose 1[ to 41 11/16 on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from SBC, most Dow components were lower as investors
remained wary of blue-chip companies' prospects in an environment
of rising interest rates. Home Depot fell 2~ to 55[ and Merck fell
1 5/16 to 59 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates four times since
last June, hoping to slow economic growth enough to stave off
inflation. After Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested last month
that central bankers remain poised to raise rates further,
investors found little reason to buy blue chips, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''His hawkish interest rate comments have folks running from
stocks that borrow a lot of money and are heavily affected by
overall economic activity,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market
strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. ''This depression among the
old-economy stocks has caused the manic buying of the new-economy
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy for technology stocks has gathered steam in recent
weeks as investors have come to believe that fast-growing high-tech
companies, which tend to be investor-financed and borrow less than
more established firms, are in the best position to withstand
rising rates that can erode corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are also hoping that the rapid growth of many
technology companies will allow them to outpace old-economy
companies, no matter how high interest rates may rise.
</P>
<P>
   Reports released today did little to suggest that the Fed's
campaign against inflation should end. The National Association of
Purchasing Management said the prices paid for manufacturing
supplies shot up to a new five-year high. Meanwhile, the Commerce
Department said spending on construction projects jumped by 2.7
percent in January, the biggest increase in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the NYSE, where volume came to 994.31 million shares, well ahead of
Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 8.94 to 586.65.

<HEADLINE> Britain Warns About St. John's Wort  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Britain's Health Department issued a warning
Wednesday over the risks of taking St. John's wort after studies
showed the popular herbal remedy may interfere with certain
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department said the herb, used to relieve mild
depression, may interfere with medicines prescribed to treat HIV
infection, heart conditions, blood clots, asthma, depression and
migraine headaches.
</P>
<P>
   The herb also may interfere with the oral contraceptive pill,
the department said, as well as medications given to transplant
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicines Control Agency is consulting with alternative
medicine organizations and trade associations on providing
information with the unlicensed remedy, including labeling changes,
the government said.
</P>
<P>
   All prescription drugs most likely to interact with St. John's
wort also will include new warnings about possible drug
interactions.
</P>
<P>
   The warning comes on the heels of two studies published last
month in The Lancet medical journal that found the herb dulls the
effectiveness of both the HIV medicine indinavir and the drug
cyclosporin, used to suppress the immune systems of transplant
patients so their bodies do not reject the new organs.
</P>
<P>
   After the release of the studies, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration cautioned health care providers about using St.
John's wort with prescription drugs that could be affected.
</P>
<P>
   It said it was working with drug manufacturers to ensure that
labeling of the medications be revised to highlight the potential
for drug interactions with St. John's wort.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Soaring telecommunications and technology stocks
pushed the Nasdaq composite index further into record territory
today and helped the Dow Jones industrials eke out a modest gain.
</P>

   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 86.10 to
close at 4,782.79, topping the closing record of 4,696.69 it set
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.69 to 10,137.00. This
week, the blue-chip index has risen in three consecutive sessions --
the first time it has done so since Jan. 12-14. But today's slim
advance came after the Dow spent much of the session in negative
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 12.83 to 1,379.25.

Analysts said the spinoff will allow Lucent to focus on its
fast-growing fiber-optics and Internet equipment businesses.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, 3Com and Sun Microsystems rose. Biotechnology
companies including Chiron also gained.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks gave the Dow its only real spark. SBC
Communications rose amid reports the company will combine its
wireless phone operations with those of BellSouth. That would allow
the companies to compete with rivals with nationwide wireless
networks. BellSouth rose on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   ''These companies are going to be real players in the new
economy, which depends on technology,'' said Barry Hyman, senior
equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum in New York. ''People

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Mull Physicians Database  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A New York woman whose obstetrician carved his
initials into her abdomen after delivering her baby asked lawmakers
Wednesday to let the public see government files on physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the National Practitioners Databank closed perpetuates
''a white wall of silence where hospitals protect doctors and
doctors protect their peers,'' Dr. Liana Gedz, a dentist, told the
House Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Gedz's physician, Dr. Allan Zarkin, was indicted on assault
charges and had his medical license revoked. His lawyer says Zarkin
suffers from a brain disease that impairs his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Gedz said if she had been allowed to see the government file on
Zarkin, she would have learned of other patients' complaints and
chosen another physician.
</P>
<P>
   The practitioners databank was created by Congress a decade ago
to keep physicians disciplined by the medical board of one state
from avoiding detection if they moved to another state and applied
for a medical license.
</P>
<P>
   Listed on the databank are physicians who have been disciplined
by medical boards or professional societies, those who have paid on
a malpractice lawsuit and those who have had hospital privileges
suspended for more than 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors recognize consumers' concerns, ''completely
opening up the databank to public scrutiny would do much more harm
than good,'' said Dr. Rodney Hochman, chief medical officer of
Sentara Healthcare in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and hospitals might stop voluntarily submitting
information to the database for fear of public disclosure, he said,
adding that the database does not always include all pertinent
facts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some insurance companies make it standard policy to
settle cases, regardless of whether malpractice was committed,
because it's cheaper than fighting, he said. That wouldn't be clear
to a consumer who views information in the database.
</P>
<P>
   The database also would unfairly flag physicians who do
high-risk procedures or are in specialties like obstetrics that
produce more lawsuits, said Rep. Greg Ganske, a Republican
congressman who is also a Des Moines, Iowa, doctor. That could
eventually lead to fewer physicians going into these specialties or
performing risky but necessary surgeries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., and several other lawmakers
suggested holding the hearing was Commerce Committee Chairman
Thomas Bliley's way of exacting revenge on the American Medical
Association for opposing Republican patient protection legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley, R-Va., denied the hearing was politically motivated. He
said it was aimed at ensuring patients get basic information when
choosing a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unconscionable that consumers have more comparative
information about the used car they purchase or the snack foods
they eat than the doctors in whose care they entrust their health
and well-being,'' Bliley said.

Paul Taylor Dance Show Mysterious   
An AP Entertainment Review, 
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sandwiched between two of his crowd pleasers,
choreographer Paul Taylor presented ''Arabesque,'' a new work, when
the Paul Taylor Dance Company opened a 45th anniversary, two-week
season at the City Center Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arabesque'' is intriguing, mysterious and dark, with almost
troubling undertones. But Taylor, 69, is so innovative and
inventive, and his dancers respond so readily to his requirements
for speed, that his unusual new dance was accepted as a treat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arabesque'' uses music by Debussy that sounds exotic and
mysterious. The dancers often hold their arms straight out, hands
turned up, in images of ancient Egypt. They wear headbands and pale
leotards, the women in skirts, the men in sheer, flowing shorts.
The overall intent is to produce a dance of Arabian flavor, not
based on a ballet position.
</P>
<P>
   Silvia Nevjinsky, who is from Portugal and joined the company in
1995, is soloist among the eight dancers. She dances when the music
is darkest, conveying exotic, frisky yet highly ritualistic
movement with a touch of menace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arabesque'' had its premiere in October in Iowa City, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The evening began with Taylor's ''Company B,'' from 1991, danced
to nine 1940s recordings by the Andrews Sisters. Recorded to boost
World War II morale, the music is upbeat, and the dancers seem to
be having spontaneous fun, notably the hip-gyrating Andrew Asnes
and high-jumping Patrick Corbin.
</P>
<P>
   The evening ended with ''Piazzolla Caldera'' from 1997, danced
just this once for the opening-night audience. Some of the
Piazzolla tangos are hot, some cool. Taylor's choreography makes
the entire dance spectacular. Corbin lifts both Francie Huber and
Lisa Viola and holds them while dancing, and Richard Chen See and
Andy LeBeau do a gravity-defying windmill routine which looks like
something from Cirque de Soleil.
</P>
<P>
   The Paul Taylor Dance Company, formed in 1955, has just returned
from Germany and Paris, where Taylor was inducted into the Order of
the Legion of Honor. After the New York season, the 16-member
company will dance, through April, in Glendale, Calif., Kingston,
Jamaica, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Flint, Mich.,
Pittsburgh, Pa., Hanover, N.H., and Albany, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Future Unclear for 'Peanuts' Shows  </HEADLINE>
By MARY ANN LICKTEIG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Schulz left strict
instructions that nobody else could draw ''Peanuts,'' and, days
before he died, told one of his daughters that animated shows
featuring Charlie Brown and the gang must end as well.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cartoonist's children are worried that the company
that owns the ''Peanuts'' franchise will turn out new programs that
stray too far from Schulz's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll end up being like ''South Park'' or something like
that,'' says Schulz's son Monte.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the family is that, although Schulz earned more
than $30 million a year from his creations, he didn't actually own
the copyright to the ''Peanuts'' characters.
</P>
<P>
   That remains firmly in the hands of United Media, which got 61
percent of its $84.9 million in 1998 revenues from the comics, TV
shows and licensing deals that put the strip's characters on
everything from lunch boxes to life insurance ads.
</P>
<P>
   When Schulz began drawing Peanuts in 1950, comics distributors
often demanded the copyrights to protect their investments. Schulz
was never able to get his back.
</P>
<P>
   United Media hasn't met with the family or Schulz's
collaborators to discuss making more shows, and wouldn't elaborate
about its plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I would say is that, at the appropriate time, we will
discuss business issues with the Schulz family and that will
include animation,'' said company spokeswoman Diane Iselin.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz had two or three more TV shows in the works at the time
of his death last month, including a Snoopy-as-Pied Piper story to
be released on home video later this year.
</P>
<P>
   His five children have no problem with continued merchandising
of Peanuts goods, as long as they can reject products they don't
like.
</P>
<P>
   But they feel that creating new ''Peanuts'' content without his
input is unacceptable -- especially after Schulz told to his
daughter Jill Transki that he expected the shows to end with his
death.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people were asking about the animated shows; I
thought get it directly from him,'' she recalled. ''He looked at me
just incredulously ... He was like, 'You've got to be crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the children who insisted that Schulz's contract
stipulate no one else would draw the strip after his death. The
contract also said he had to approve all ''creative projects,'' a
right that now belongs to his widow, Jean, and his children,
according to the family's lawyer, Barbara Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher believes creative projects includes animated shows --
and that she trusts United Media to heed the family's wishes. ''I
don't believe that they're going to try to pursue anything that the
family doesn't want,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Monte Schulz got worried after a United Media
representative hinted that the company will want to create new
shows to help maintain the franchise's value.
</P>
<P>
   ''But forget it,'' he said. ''At the expense of the integrity of
the strip? The characters themselves? Dad's legacy? Not a chance.
We'll have to live with fewer dollars in our pockets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only way the family might accept new shows is if the story
line and dialog were pulled directly from existing strips, said
Monte Schulz, who doesn't favor the idea.
</P>
<P>
   For United Media, there's plenty at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Annual revenue from the strip in 1998 was only about $2 million,
according to the latest figures available from United Media's
parent, The E.W. Scripps Co., while licensing of Peanuts products,
including the TV shows, brought in $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   New animated shows would keep the franchise fresh, stimulating
demand for related products, said securities analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was under the impression the strips would stop but
everything else would kind of continue business as usual,'' said
James Marsh, an analyst with Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz's two closest collaborators on the TV shows, producer Lee
Mendelson, 66, and animator Bill Melendez, 84, haven't ruled out
creating more if asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Its not my decision; it's the decision of the children and
United Media,'' Mendelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Melendez said he can write stories that would be true to Schulz,
and he believes that United Media will try to find a way to make
more. ''I've never seen a money-making machine like this just let
die, especially by the people who own it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Melendez fears the company will hire other animators who
never worked with Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as they want me to make these shows, I'll do them. And
if they don't want me to do them, they're going to run into a real
nest of hornets. Because I'm the only one that can do them,''
Melendez said.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Johnson, one of Schulz's daughters, thinks her father's
legacy -- which includes 62 animated shows and four feature-length
movies in United Media's library -- should be left to stand on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly we can look at those things over and over. You read
great books over and over. You look at great paintings over and
over. And that's what you want to pass down to your children.''

<HEADLINE> Regulators Probe Saline Implants  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- Federal regulators opened scientific
hearings Wednesday to determine if saline-filled breast implants
are safe enough for thousands of women to continue getting -- or if
they break open and deflate too often.
</P>
<P>
   Some 9.2 percent of saline-filled implants given to breast
cancer patients ruptured and deflated within three years of
implantation, manufacturer Mentor Corp. told a Food and Drug
Administration meeting.
</P>
<P>
   That risk was three times greater for breast cancer patients
than for women who had their breasts enlarged cosmetically, the
study of 1,680 implant recipients found.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 40 percent of cancer patients who received saline
implants needed some repeat surgery within three years, and 24
percent of these implant recipients suffered breast hardening from
scar tissue, a complication that can be very painful.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer patients whose first implant deflated, Mentor said
the chance a second implant would break was 22 percent, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   Data on the risks of saline-filled breast implants has long been
awaited. About 130,000 American women received saline implants last
year, even though the FDA never has declared them safe.
</P>
<P>
   Saline implants currently are sold because of a government
loophole: They hit the market before the FDA began regulating
medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   These implants are the only option for most women seeking breast
reconstruction or cosmetic breast enlargement. In 1992, the FDA
banned silicone gel-filled implants except for a small number of
women in strict clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA now is reviewing saline implants to decide if they are
safe enough to continue selling and, if so, how to make sure women
understand that -- despite what many plastic surgeons now claim --
their implants are not guaranteed to last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen women, some angry and some tearful, urged the FDA
to declare the implants dangerous and defective. Some held up
implants removed from their bodies that were blackened with fungus,
and blamed them for causing infections, excruciating breast pain or
repeated surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   The implants may have a higher failure rate than any other
medical device FDA lets sell, said Dr. Norman Anderson of Johns
Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only fools will call these risks acceptable,'' said Patricia
Faussett of Henderson, Nev., who said her illnesses disappeared
once her implants were removed.
</P>
<P>
   But some breast cancer patients happy with saline implants
called them vital to emotional recovery after a mastectomy. ''It
has given me back my self-esteem and sexuality,'' said Jennifer
Gardner of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of women in the 1990s claimed implants gave
them serious diseases, from arthritis to cancer. But after repeated
scientific studies, the prestigious Institute of Medicine last year
declared that breast implants, whether silicone gel- or
saline-filled, do not cause major diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA always has considered saline implants less risky simply
because if they break, they release salt water into the body, not a
foreign substance. But officials are concerned about how often the
implants break or cause local complications.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, University of Maryland radiologist Dr. Wendie Berg
told the FDA it is significantly harder for mammograms to detect
breast cancer when the X-rays have to penetrate breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We provide a safe and effective option for women,'' responded
Mentor vice president Bobby Purkait.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor cited studies that found no cancer diagnosis problems,
and contended many women have repeat surgeries because they want
bigger implants or are upset that one breast turned out larger than
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Implants were riskier for cancer patients because they already
were in poor health, prone to infections and undergo repeated
breast exams and treatments that could stress the implant, company
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, 3.3 percent of the implants used in cosmetic breast
enlargement broke and deflated within three years, Mentor said.
Some 6.9 percent of the cosmetic patients had hardened breast
tissue and 1.7 percent infections.

<HEADLINE> New Nasdaq High; Dow Ends Up 9.62  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Soaring telecommunications and technology stocks
pushed the Nasdaq composite index further into record territory
Wednesday and helped the Dow Jones industrials eke out a modest
gain.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite rose 87.39 to close at
4,784.08, topping the closing high of 4,696.69 it set Tuesday. The
Nasdaq also set a new volume record, with 2.14 billion shares
changing hands as of 5:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.62 to 10,137.93. The
blue-chip index has now advanced in three consecutive sessions --
the first time it has done so since Jan. 12-14. But Wednesday's
slim gain came after the Dow spent much of the session in negative
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
rose 12.77 to 1,379.19. Small-company stocks extended their gains,
lifting the Russell 2000 10.64 to 588.35, its second straight
record.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of relatively broad gains, the market reverted to
its familiar divergent pattern, with technology stocks leaping
higher while old-line industrial stocks slid.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technology rose 8 11/16 to 68 3/16 after announcing plans
to spin off the units that sell corporate phone systems and make
wire cabling for office networks. Analysts said the spinoff will
allow Lucent to focus on its fast-growing fiber-optics and Internet
equipment businesses.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, 3Com rose 6[ to 104[ and Sun Microsystems rose 2
11/16 to 97 15/16. Biotechnology companies including Chiron, up 15
to 65, also gained.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks gave the Dow its only real spark. SBC
Communications rose 3 15/16 to 41 11/16 amid reports the company
will combine its wireless phone operations with those of BellSouth.
Shares of BellSouth rose 2 7/16 to 43 on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   ''These companies are going to be real players in the new
economy, which depends on technology,'' said Barry Hyman, senior
equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum in New York. ''People
are willing to pay up for tech stocks because that's where the
growth is.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from SBC, most Dow components were lower as investors
remained wary of blue-chip companies' prospects in an environment
of rising interest rates. Home Depot fell 1~ to 55| and Merck fell
1 9/16 to 60.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates four times since
last June, hoping to slow economic growth enough to stave off
inflation. After Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested last month
that central bankers remain poised to raise rates further,
investors found little reason to buy blue chips, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''His hawkish interest rate comments have folks running from
stocks that borrow a lot of money and are heavily affected by
overall economic activity,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market
strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. ''This depression among the
old-economy stocks has caused the manic buying of the new-economy
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy for technology stocks has grown in recent weeks as
investors have come to believe that fast-growing high-tech
companies, which tend to be investor-financed and borrow less than
more established firms, are in the best position to withstand
rising rates that can erode corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are also hoping that the rapid growth of many
technology companies will allow them to outpace old-economy
companies, no matter how high interest rates may rise.
</P>
<P>
   Reports released Wednesday did little to suggest that the Fed
should end its campaign against inflation. The National Association
of Purchasing Management said the prices paid for manufacturing
supplies shot up to a new five-year high. Meanwhile, the Commerce
Department said spending on construction projects jumped by 2.7
percent in January, the biggest increase in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   A spike in oil prices also set off some inflation jitters.
Crude-oil futures rose to the highest levels in nine years, nearing
$32 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil-services companies
rose, with Schlumberger up 7 29/64 to 81 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE consolidated volume totaled 1.54 billion shares, compared
with 1.45 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.6 percent.
Germany's DAX index gained 1.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose
2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.1 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> New 'Peanuts' Shows in Production  </HEADLINE>
By MARY ANN LICKTEIG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Schulz was involved in two
more ''Peanuts'' shows that will appear this year, a home video
called, ''It's the Pied Piper, Charlie Brown,'' and a 50th
anniversary TV special scheduled to air on CBS in May.
</P>
<P>
   The TV show, ''Here's to You, Charlie Brown: 50 Great Years,''
is partially animated. It features highlights from past shows, 10
minutes of new animation and interaction between real people and
members of the ''Peanuts'' gang.
</P>
<P>
   Look for country music star Faith Hill singing ''Poor Sweet
Baby'' to Charlie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peanuts'' fans accustomed to heard-but-not-seen grownups -- a
trombone was used for the ''wah-wah'' language they used -- might be
surprised by one thing they see in the Pied Piper video: adults.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz personally signed off this, animator Bill Melendez said.
''We had to animate them. The city council and the mayor had to be
adults. He said, 'Fine. Let's have adults, no problem.' But you
never know how people will react.''
</P>
<P>
   Adults have appeared before in the ''Peanuts'' pantheon. The
1988 miniseries, ''This is America, Charlie Brown'' featured the
''Peanuts'' gang in period costume interacting with pilgrims at
Plymouth Rock, the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk, Thomas Edison and
other historical figures.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he died, Schulz also sent Melendez an outline for
another show -- a story involving a game of marbles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a name for it, ''It's only marbles, Charlie Brown,''
Melendez said. ''He gave me the notes. And I've been working on a
storyboard. I was going to show it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans for that show are uncertain.

<HEADLINE> Some Puerto Ricans Nix Govt. Study  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A federal survey that found Puerto Ricans reported
being sick more often other Hispanics was questioned Wednesday by
members of Puerto Rican groups who feared the information could be
used to stereotype them.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Duany, president of the Puerto Rican Professional
Association of South Florida, said he was concerned the report
might cause health insurance providers to raise Puerto Ricans'
rates, or make them less attractive job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We commend their initiative to actually recognize that there
are different Hispanic subgroups,'' Duany said. ''Our concern is
the long-term implications.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-year study was released last Friday by the National
Center for Health Statistics, which is part of the Centers for
Disease Control. It showed that Puerto Ricans reported being sick
more often than Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans and others of
Hispanic descent. They had more doctor visits, hospital stays and
sick days off from work and school than other Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which looked at data from a national health survey
of all Americans collected from 1992 through 1995, focused on the
largest Hispanic subgroups: Mexicans, Puerto Ricans and Cubans. All
other people of Hispanic origin were grouped together.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on interviews of more than 60,000 Hispanics.
Nearly 30 million people of Hispanic origin reside in the United
States, representing 11 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Duany's group, along with the National Coalition for Puerto
Rican Women and the Puerto Rican Chamber of Commerce, criticized
the report, saying researchers failed to take into account several
factors, including the social and economic status of respondents,
where they lived and what kind of access they had to medical
services.
</P>
<P>
   Anjum Hajat, the study's author, said the report was only a
basic look, resulting in raw data that should not be used to draw
larger conclusions.

<HEADLINE> Panel: One Saline Implant Brand Safe  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- Saline-filled breast implants break
open at ''alarmingly high'' rates and require women to undergo
repeated surgeries, but at least one brand is safe enough to
continue selling as long as women are properly warned of the risks,
a government advisory board decided late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   About 130,000 American women received saline-filled breast
implants last year even though the Food and Drug Administration has
never declared these implants safe.
</P>
<P>
   The implants sell because of a government loophole -- but the FDA
recently decided they can only continue selling if manufacturers
prove they truly are safe, and asked its scientific advisers to
evaluate brands sold by California-based Mentor Corp. and two
competitors this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a 13-hour meeting Wednesday, about a dozen implant recipients
emotionally urged that saline implants be banned. Some held up
implants removed from their bodies that were blackened with fungus
that had infected the moist implants, and blamed them for causing
infections, excruciating breast pain or repeated surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only fools will call these risks acceptable,'' said Patricia
Faussett of Henderson, Nev., who said her illnesses disappeared
once her implants were removed.

<HEADLINE> FDA Halts Gene Therapy Trial  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN MELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The federal government has halted a heart disease
gene therapy trial at a hospital here and at several others around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday refused to
release further details, other than to confirm it had put a hold on
trials by Durham, N.C.-based Vascular Genetics Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The order by the FDA came less than a month after President
Clinton ordered a review of gene therapy guidelines after reports
that some researchers failed to carefully explain risks to
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The trials by Vascular Genetics were aimed at growing new blood
vessels around blocked heart and leg arteries in patients who could
not undergo traditional procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA refused to say why the trial was halted, but in a news
release, VGI said the company would provide the government the
results of clinical trials and measurements of the amount of the
gene protein in patient blood samples.
</P>
<P>
   Gene therapy attempts to repair or replace abnormal genes in
seriously ill patients by transferring synthetically manufactured
genes into the body.
</P>
<P>
   The trial at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center was overseen by Dr.
Jeffrey Isner, the chief of cardiovascular research and a professor
at Tufts University medical school. He did not immediately respond
to a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Isner was one of two researchers trying to grow new blood
vessels around blocked ones who failed to report immediately to the
National Institutes of Health that six patients died during their
gene therapy studies.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those deaths were at St. Elizabeth's, but doctors said
the deaths were likely related to other causes and not gene
therapy. One of those patients was involved in the VGI trial, said
Sonya Hagopian, St. Elizabeth's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 patients at about a half-dozen hospitals around the
country had been involved in the trials that were halted. Most
already completed the trial and results were expected to be
presented next week at the American College of Cardiology.
