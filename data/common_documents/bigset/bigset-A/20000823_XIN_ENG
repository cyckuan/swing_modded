</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepal Strives to Improve People's Health by Zhuang Meijie, Song Dejun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A program was launched in
Nepal Monday by some internal and international non-governmental
organizations to raise the awareness of sanitation among people
and prioritize the environmental sanitation issues in the nation's
development agenda.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the program is to "make people understand the
basic hygienic ways of living and bring sanitation and hygiene in
national advocacy through media reporting," said Wing-Sie Cheng,
chief of communications at UNICEF (U.N. Children's Fund), one of
the organizers of the program.
</P>
<P>
Sanitation situation is presenting an ever grimmer picture in
Nepal. Statistics show that Nepalese spend 10 billion rupees (140
million U.S. dollars) annually to cure diseases due to lack of
sanitation and clean drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Although the Nepali government spent 300 million dollars in
recent years on sanitation projects, the situation is not so
encouraging yet.
</P>
<P>
Data presented by Dr. Sarad Onta at a consultative meeting for
the program held on Monday shows that the infant mortality rate in
Nepal is 80 deaths every 1,000 births, 125 babies among 1,000
under five years old die of cholera and around 35,000 children
aged under five die every year due to diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
The data also reveals that 40 percent of the people suffer from
various diseases due to unhygienic living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Besides poor sanitation and unclean drinking water, unhygienic
behavior and ways of living are also the factor leading to the
wide prevalence of contagious diseases in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing problems in making people realize the importance
of clean sanitary habits," said Mohan Bhatta, an official with the
Public Health Department.
</P>
<P>
For many Nepalese, especially those in rural areas, abandoning
their age-old habits of searching for "a corner behind the bushes"
nearby is easier and more acceptable than going to the newly-
constructed toilet. About 80 percent of rural families do not have
a toilet of their own.
</P>
<P>
The practice of keeping menstruating women and those on labor
in the cowsheds is still widely practiced in rural areas due to
superstitious thinking.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the seriousness of the sanitation problem, the Nepali
government has set the target of making clean drinking water
available to all people and sanitation available to 40 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
However, given the present availability of drinking water and
sanitation to 61 percent and 20 percent of the total population,
experts fear that the target is too ambitious.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Refuses to Grant Bail to Journalists on Spy Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A Liberian court Tuesday turned
down a request to grant bail to four foreign journalists on spying
charges.
</P>
<P>
"Under Liberian law, espionage is a first degree felony and
there can be no bail," Judge Timothy Swope was quoted as saying in
the west African nation's capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Gugu Radebe, a freelance South African cameraman, Timothy
Lambon, who holds dual British and South African citizenship,
Sierra Leonean producer Samura Sorious and Briton David Barrie
were arrested in Monrovia last Friday on suspicion of espionage
while filming a three-part documentary for the British television
station Channel 4.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's Justice Department has accused them of engaging in "
clandestine activity to injure the image and character of the
president of Liberia".
</P>
<P>
The case has drawn an angry reaction from Britain. The British
Foreign Office minister for African affairs Peter Hain warned
Liberia Tuesday that the men's detention had put it on a collision
course with the international community and called for their
immediate release.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.S. special envoy to Africa Jesse Jackson has
reportedly appealed to President Charles Taylor to release the
four men.
</P>
<P>
According to Jackson, Taylor promised to give his request "his
highest consideration" but only after the journalists appear
before a magistrate court.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the four, who arrived in the country on August 1
and were charged on Monday, could face up to 10 years in jail,
according to reports.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents Pose Grave Threat to Jordanian Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The alarming rate of traffic
accidents in Jordan has posed a serious social and economic threat
to the kingdom as the accidents claimed hundreds of lives and
millions of U.S. dollars in economic losses each year, a senior
police officer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar held in the northern town of Irbid, Deputy Director
of the Public Security Department Abdul Salem Garfira said 676
people were killed and 19,015 people injured in road accidents in
1999 alone, with a total estimated economic loss of some 200
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 11,000 people have been killed and 250,000 others injured
in nearly half a million traffic accidents in the desert kingdom,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Most of the accidents took place in the capital Amman or its
surrounding areas, which are home to one third of the country's 4.7
million population, he said.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1999, the kingdom has witnessed a 13 percent growth
in its traffic accidents and a 8 percent growth rate in traffic-
related casualties annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the traffic safety of Jordan is far below
international standards, and the death rate among each 10,000
vehicles stands at 16, or 10 times higher than that of developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Traffic authorities are launching education campaigns among
drivers, and imposing tougher traffic laws to curb the rising road
accidents across the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Under a new law, the maximum fine could be up to 1,000 Jordanian
dinars (1,400 dollars) on hit-and-run drivers, or drivers who are
transporting hazardous materials or explosives without proper
authorization.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Air Plane Crashes Near Bahrain, 70 Bodies Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAMA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- About 70 bodies, mostly children,
have been recovered from the wreckage of the crashed Gulf Air plane
off Bahraini coast Wednesday night, but no survivors have been
found yet.
</P>
<P>
Rescue operation is continuing and helicopters from the U.S.
Navy 5th Fleet based in Bahrain are assisting in search for more
bodies, possible survivors and the two blackboxes that record
pilots' conversations and the performance of the plane.
</P>
<P>
The two-engine Airbus A320, carrying 135 passengers and eight
crew and on a schedule flight from Egyptian capital Cairo to
Bahrain went down at 1630 GMT in the Persian Gulf 4.8 to 6.4
kilometers north of Bahrain after two landing attempts, a Bahraini
official said.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini officials had earlier said the flight GF072 plunged
into the waters shortly after taking off from the Bahraini
International Airport in the country's capital of Manama.
</P>
<P>
The passengers included 63 Egyptians, 34 Bahrainis, 12 Saudis,
two Britons, an Australian, nine Palestinians, six from the United
Arab Emirates, three Chinese, one Korean, one Kuwaiti, one Sudanese
and one Omani, officials of the Gulf Air confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Air belongs in equal parts to Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the
government of Abu Dhabi, the largest of seven sheikdoms making up
the United Arab Emirates. The Bahrain-based Gulf Air operates a
fleet of 28 planes and flies to 53 international destinations.
</P>
<P>
There are altogether 1,100 A320s in service around the world and
the Airbus A320 can seat up to 150 passengers.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are the economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Cartier International is expected to open its
Middle East office in Dubai towards the end of October.
</P>
<P>
A warehouse and a regional after-sales centre will be set up at
the Dubai Airport Free Zone, said Philippe McGarry, managing
director of Vendome (Dubai), holder of Cartier International and
other brands.
</P>
<P>
Last April, Cartier started dealing directly with retail
customers and sent a delegation to the region to analyse the
market.
</P>
<P>
Another team visited the Middle East in June to finalize the
commercial audit of regional operations and look at retaining or
closing down some points-of-sale.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- There are big savings in store for the United Arab
Emirates travellers as major airlines here are poised to slash
fares and offer bonanza packages in a bid to fill seats during the
annual slack period which starts early next month.
</P>
<P>
Major airlines flying to the United States, Europe, and East
Asia will cut their fares, and some are also developing special
packages and incentives to lure more passengers during the off-peak
season.
</P>
<P>
Travel agency sources in Abu Dhabi said most of the airlines
would maintain their low fares as an incentive to attract
passengers until March 31 next year to cover the period following
the traditional peak travelling season in the emirates.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Studies at the Al Lootah International University
For Internet will begin from the new academic year next month, Haj
Saeed bin Ahmed Al Lootah, president of the University's Supreme
Council was quoted on Wednesday by local media.
</P>
<P>
He stated that all information about the University will be
available at the web site: www.lootah.sch.ae.
</P>
<P>
The University will offer two programmes, master's and doctoral
degrees in Economics and Commerce, Islamic Banking, Management and
Leadership, Accounting and Computer Science and Information
Systems.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The size of the UAE's information technology market
could cross the 2-billion-dirham (546.4 million U.S. dollars) mark
for the first time this year, nearly 20 percent over 1999's 1.68
billion dirhams (459 million dollars), according to International
Data Corp. (IDC) estimates.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- A senior Iranian official stressed on Wednesday that
the country should make more investments in tourism to increase
government revenues.
</P>
<P>
Iran is among the top 10 tourist sites in the world, but
significant domestic investments are needed to fetch good revenues
in this sector, said Deputy Interior Minister for Development
Affairs Ahmad Khorram.

will visit Egypt on Saturday for more consultations with President
Hosni Mubarak on the peace talks with Israel, the official Middle

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Rebels Pledge Cooperation With UNAMSIL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) has pledged to cooperate with the United
Nations Peace Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) to resume the
peace process under the Lome Peace Accord signed last year,
according to a report reaching here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was made following a meeting between the RUF and
presidents Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, Charles Taylor of Liberia
and Oumar Konare of Mali, who is also the chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), in the Liberian capital
Monrovia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a press communique released by the RUF after the
meeting, the RUF would cooperate with the UNAMSIL in the
deployment of UN peace-keepers in the RUF-controlled areas to
ensure the success of the disarmament program in particular, and
the peace process in general as mandated in the Lome Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
The RUF welcomed the Sierra Leone government's decision to
release about 170 RUF fighters in detention as a step of
confidence building.
</P>
<P>
In return, the RUF decided to hand over the equipment it
captured from the UNAMSIL.

<HEADLINE> Mandate of U.N. Mission in Congo Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a resolution adopted after informal consultations, the
Council said the "technical extension" can also allow the Council
more time to think about the mission's future mandate and "
possible adjustments".
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the mission, known as MONUC, is set to expire on
August 31 according to the February 24 Council resolution, which
requests U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to present his next
report on the latest developments in the Central African country
by August 24.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Council released here a week ago, the U.N.
chief requested an interim extension of the mission through
September 30 to allow sufficient time to assess the impact of the
latest developments and to formulate recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The "adverse climate" in the DRC has so far prevented the
deployment of MONUC in accordance with relevant Council
resolutions, said Annan, calling attention to the persistent large-
scale fighting in many parts of the country, formerly known as
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the severe restrictions imposed by the DRC
authorities and other parties on MONUC's freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace process, which started in 1999 to end the two-
year civil war which has claimed 1.7 million lives, is undergoing
"an extremely challenging phase" and requires substantial re-
evaluation by its signatories and the United Nations, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The Council agreed in February to send 500 cease-fire observers
and 5,500 troops to protect them. But the plan has been put on
hold because Kinshasa barred them from entering the area under the
government control.
</P>
<P>
The latest resolution requests Annan to report to the Council
by September 21 on progress in implementing the cease-fire
agreement and make recommendations for further Council action.

WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday urged the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) to increase production and cautioned that OPEC would suffer

countries and then the supply -- the purchases will drop
dramatically and for a longer period of time," the president said
at a press conference at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he would be happier with oil prices in the
range of 20-25 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
"The low- to mid-20s is a more sustainable rate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would discuss the issue during his upcoming
meetings with Nigerian President Obasanjo and with leaders of
other oil-producing countries. Nigeria is a member of OPEC.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices surged again Wednesday as dealers reacted sharply to
news of an unexpected decline in inventories held by the United
States, the world's largest oil importer.
</P>
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute said Tuesday that U.S. crude
stocks in the week to August 18 down 7.7 million barrels at 279.7
million, 11 percent down on the same time last year and near a 24-
year low.
</P>
<P>
Oil has risen sharply from a 22-year low of less than 10
dollars a barrel in 1998 after a series of OPEC supply curbs which
the cartel has partially lifted this year.
</P>
<P>
OPEC ministers are expected to raise production by at least 500,
000 barrels daily when they meet on September 10 in Vienna.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expresses Support for Mexican President-Elect Fox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Wednesday that he would reaffirm U.S. strong support to close
ties with Mexico when he meet Mexican president-elect Vicente Fox
this week.
</P>
<P>
"I want to reaffirm the support of the United States, which I
think is bipartisan, for good strong relationships with Mexico,"
Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Fox, who won a presidential election on July 2 and will take
office on December 1, will arrive Washington on Thursday after his
visit to Canada.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he wanted to discuss with Fox the two countries'
efforts to deal with the problem of illegal drugs, common
environmental issues along the border, and how to make the U.S.-
Mexican trade relationship work for both sides.
</P>
<P>
"I think he's quite serious about modernizing the Mexican
economy and moving forward with our relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about Fox's proposal to expand North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) into a body like the European Union,
Clinton said he wanted to hear what Fox would have to say.
</P>
<P>
"In general, I think there will be increasing interdependence
of the world's economies over the next decade, increasing
interdependence in our region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't extend our trade agreements to the rest of South
America, and I think that the Europeans have benefited at our
expense," Clinton said. "So I think there will be more
interdependence and the United States has to be a part of that."
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who met with Fox in
Ottawa on Tuesday, expressed little enthusiasm for Fox's proposal,
saying he thought that NAFTA was going very well and did not think
that one could apply European-style rules to the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges Afghan Parties to Resume Talks Without Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Wednesday urged Afghan parties, in particular the
Taliban, to stop fighting and resume the negotiations under the
United Nations auspices without further delay and preconditions.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the 15-member Security Council was briefed
by the Secretariat on the latest situation in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its grave concern over the continued armed conflict
in the country, the Security Council reiterated its call to all
Afghan parties to work together for peace and the establishment of
a broad-based multiethnic and fully representative government.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed its deep concern over further
deterioration of the humanitarian and human rights situation in
the country and insisted that all parties take responsibility for
the safety and the security of the civilian population and of
humanitarian personnel.
</P>
<P>
The council condemned the recent killing of seven de-mining
workers working under the auspices of the United Nations mine-
clearing program and called on the Taliban authorities to bring
the perpetrators to justice.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated that continuing disregard by the Taliban
of the demands made in its relevant resolutions was totally
unacceptable, and confirmed its determination to ensure full
compliance by the Taliban without conditions with its obligations
under relevant U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Suspends Aid Operations in West Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The move followed "the worst attack" against the agency's
personnel working in West Timor with three UNHCR staffers
suffering severe injuries, spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place Tuesday night while the three were
distributing plastic sheeting at a refugee camp 130 km east of the
provincial capital of Kupang. They were beaten up by local militia
armed with machetes, clubs and stones, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesian Army officials in the area failed to respond
immediately to the incident, considered by UNHCR as the worst of
more than 100 recorded cases of harassment and intimidation
against aid workers and refugees since last September," Eckhard
added.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday Indonesian authorities told the U.N. Traditional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) that the refugee camps in
West Timor will be closed down within three to six months in
coordination with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The UNTAET welcomed the initiative to expedite voluntary
repatriation or resettlement of the refugees still in West Timor,
according to Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 85,000 to 120,000 East Timor refugees,
who fled or were forced by pro-Indonesia militia to flee to West
Timor when violence erupted in East Timor after its people voted
overwhelmingly for independence in August 1999.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Much has to be done to curb the
spread of HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa, a red cross official said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Holger Liepe, head of a delegation in Zambia from the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (
IFRCS), told the Zambia Red Cross HIV/AIDS youth initiative
campaign that HIV/AIDS is the biggest threat in many countries and
has retarded development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Liepe attributed the rapid spread of the disease to the lack of
seriousness and financial constraints.
</P>
<P>
He added that changing the behavior of fellow citizens should
be of first priority if the initiative was to be a success.
</P>
<P>
He urged the youths and volunteers to teach the people the
importance of using condoms and that they should stay faithful to
one partner in order to halt the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function, Zambia Red Cross Society youth
advisor Joel Oyo said the organization would make sure the
initiative was taken to the furthest point in the country since it
had the largest number of youth volunteers placed around the
country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean War Veterans Protest at President Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's war veterans held
demonstration outside President Robert Mugabe's office here
Wednesday, demanding an explanation on why police destroyed their
properties.
</P>
<P>
According to the Zimbabwe News Agency, Home Affairs Minister
John Nkomo last week had instructed police to evict war veterans
from the white-owned farms and private land they had occupied by
burning and destroying their houses.
</P>
<P>
"John Nkomo has sold out. Down with him," said one of the many
messages inscribed on placards waved by the former liberation
fighters outside Mugabe's office.
</P>
<P>
Although the war veterans went to Mugabe's office in the
morning, they had not met the president by lunch time. Mugabe was
said to be attending a Cabinet meeting in the same building.
</P>
<P>
Neither war veterans leader Chenjerai Hunzvi nor commander-in-
chief of the farm invasions Joseph Chinotimba could be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans have occupied about 1,500 white farms since
February this year to pressure the government to speed up land
reform. Mugabe had previously supported the war veterans' action.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has designated over 3,000 white farms
for seizure to resettle landless war veterans and black peasants.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Inappropriate to Attend Peace Summit: Chinese Religious Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 24 (Xinhua) - The Dalai Lama is a turmoil-
maker instead of peace-maker and is thus absolutely inappropriate
to be invited or allowed to attend the upcoming Millenium World
Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders to be held at the
United Nations Headquarters, a Chinese religious delegation said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of Dalai Lama is closely related to the emotional
feeling of the Chinese people and the sovereignty of the state,
and the Chinese people have, as always, been resolute in this
issue," said Jamyang Losang Jigme Tubdain Qoigyi Nyima, top Living
Buddha of Tibetan Buddhism and member of the delegation, which
will attend the peace summit.
</P>
<P>
"Some people want to make it an issue and trying to split Tibet
from China and interfere in China's internal affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Michael Fu Tieshan, head of the delegation, said that
the peace summit should be for peace-makers, instead of for
trouble- or turmoil-makers.
</P>
<P>
"The Dalai Lama has been engaged in splittist activities and
creating turmoil in Tibet, and his presence at the meeting is
inconsistent with the theme of the summit," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Convicts 151 Falun Gong-related Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 23 (Xinhua) - Chinese courts nationwide, by
August 15, convicted and meted out criminal penalties to 151 hard-
core Falun Gong practitioners who committed crimes, said Ye
Xiaowen, director-general of China's State Administration of
Religious Affairs, at a press conference here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the convicted, 22 were given sentences up to five years in
prison, according to Ye, who also serves as an advisor to the
visiting Chinese delegation of religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "the convicted are those who either leaked
state secrets, or making use of Falun Gong to create social chaos,
or committed other crimes."
</P>
<P>
Of the 2.1 million people practicing the Falun Gong cult in
China, those prosecuted are only a tiny fraction, and the majority,
or more than 98 percent, have been converted to normal life after
persuasion and education for over a year, according to the most
senior official in charge of religious affairs in China.
</P>
<P>
In response to local reporters' question on the stance of China
's religious circles on the government crackdown upon the Falun
Gong cult, Buddhist master Sheng Hui said today that the Falun
Gong cult is just as harmful as narcotics, who "has no difference
from drug traffickers."
</P>
<P>
"Due to its strong capability to control the mind of
practitioners, more than 1,600 have committed suicide or been
killed as a result of indulging in practicing the Falun Gong cult,
and 650 people have serious mental problems, of whom 14
perpetrated the felony of homicide," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist master, who is vice-president of the China
Buddhist Association, said that Buddhists were the first who
identified Falun Gong as an evil cult as early as 1996, three
years ahead of government crackdown, because the cult "stole" many
concepts of Buddhism and distorted them for evil purposes.
</P>
<P>
Both Ye and the Buddhist master warned the public that Falun
Gong is so cunning that it usually takes on different cloaks to
cheat people, which is why it fooled so many people both in China
and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
"When the Chinese Qigong was popular, the master of Falun Gong
Li Hongzhi said he was practicing Qigong for the good of health,
and seeing that religions were respected in China, he said he was
a religious leader," said master Sheng Hui.
</P>
<P>
"He is a wildcatter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the big advertisements run by the Falun Gong
group in major U.S. newspapers, including the New York Times,
saying that Falun Gong is Qigong again, Ye said that Li Hongzhi is
just playing another trick to fool the public, Ye said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Policy Is to Move Peace Process Forward: Ben-Ami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The central task of the Israeli
foreign policy is to move the Middle East peace process forward,
Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Camp David summit in July, the Israeli-
Palestinian negotiators have been meeting with each other and
trying their best to work out the differences on the central issues
in the final-status talks, Ben-Ami told a press conference
organized by the Foreign Press Association.
</P>
<P>
He rejected news reports that the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiators have stoped negotiations since the Camp David, saying
that he himself has been working with Palestinian chief negotiator
Saeb Erekat to try to move the talks ahead.
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is to reach a draft agreement on all
the key issues of the final-status talks by late September, to pave
the way for holding another three-way summit, in which Israeli and
Palestinian leaders can sign it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David summit in the United States, attended by Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.
S. President Bill Clinton, ended on July 25 but failed to reach a
framework agreement on such key issues as the fate of Jerusalem,
borders, Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
"The Camp David summit was not a total failure, and progress has
been on the issues of borders, settlements and even the Palestinian
refugees, but not on the Jerusalem issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had raised three proposals on the Jerusalem issue during
the Camp David summit and one of the them was asking Israelis and
Palestinians to share the sovereignty of the city, but all the
three proposals were rejected by the Palestinian side, he added.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the Jerusalem issue is too sensitive to settle.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem has the holy sites for three religions of Jews,
Muslims and Christians. Ben-Ami said Israel will never give up the
Jewish holy site and Jewish quarters in East Jerusalem, but a "
symbolic solution" to the Jerusalem issue must be found.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem has two parts. The eastern part, or East Jerusalem,
was captured and occupied by Israel during the 1967 Middle East
War. Almost all the holy sites of the three religions are located
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
As proposed by Clinton, Israel now also prefers to "defer the
settlement" of the Jerusalem issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami will travel to Egypt on Thursday to hold talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who has his own proposals for the
settlement of the Jerusalem, and to listen carefully what Mubarak
is going to say.
</P>
<P>
It is urgent for Israel and the Palestinians to reach a peace
agreement, and it's time for the two sides to make final decisions
instead of going to conferences to conferences, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami met Erekat again Tuesday night to discuss the Jerusalem
and other final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
The renewed talks appeared to be the results of mediation
efforts by U.S. special Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, who
has been in the region for a week.

<P>
CAIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey needs to import 1 million tons of corn to meet
domestic demand for feed grain this year.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Turkish Feed Grain Industrialists Association,
Ulku Karakus, said the country's maize production in the 2000-2001
harvest season is expected to reach around 2 million tons and 1
million tons of imports would be required.
</P>
<P>
The government usually lowers import duty when domestic stocks
run low around the spring, so imports can cover much of the
remaining domestic demand until the next spring.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey would likely have to import 150,000 tons more
of sunflower seed and oil in 2000-2001 than previously expected.
</P>
<P>
Deputy president of the Oilseeds Producers Association, Okyar
Yayarlar, said that this was due to the heat damage to the domestic
crop in July and that the 2000-2001 sunflower crop was of low
quality as well.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey normally imports some 600,000 tons of
sunflower seed and oil every year.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The business aviation services company Jet Aviation
plans to enter the United Arab Emirates' Dubai as part of its
expansion in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We are monitoring Dubai to see how the business is growing,"
said Norbert Ehrich, vice president and general manager of Jet
Aviation in Saudi Arabia, "Dubai holds the largest potential for
our next operation in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Jet Aviation operates more than 140 aircraft with almost 3,500
employees in 30 locations across Europe, East Asia, North and South
America and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- More residential areas in the UAE's Sharjah emirate
will be connected to the Sharjah natural gas supply network by the
end of this month, according to the Natural Gas Department at
Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority (Sewa).
</P>
<P>
Sewa started the 500-million-dirham (136.6 million U.S. dollars)
piped natural gas supply project in April last year.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, which was completed earlier this year, 25,
000 consumers in Al Majaz, Bu Shegarah, Al Qassimiyah, Al Manak, Al
Yarmouk and some other areas were covered with direct supply of
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The second phase started in April this year and is expected to
be completed in mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The latest statistics on Egypt's international
cooperation activity during the January-July period this year
disclosed a notable increase in non-refundable grants Egypt
obtained from abroad to 895 million dollars, up 67 percent from the
same period in l999.
</P>
<P>
Total loans during the respective period were 275 million
dollars, down 30 percent from the corresponding period last year.
Combined grants and loans Egypt got during the first seven months
this year hit 1.1 billion dollars, said the report.

BAGHDAD, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Wednesday repeated its
rejection to the United Nations Resolution 1284 and vowed not to
allow the U.N. arms inspectors back, the official Iraqi News Agency
(INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the National Assembly (parliament),
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz rejected any cooperation
with the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission
(UNMOVIC).
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's stand is constant and will never change," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The latest refusal to the U.N. resolution came after a report
saying that the UNMOVIC would be ready to start preliminary arms
inspection work this month.
</P>
<P>
Hans Blix, head of the UNMOVIC, said in June that preliminary
investigations could be done "towards the end of August."
</P>
<P>
Blix pointed out, however, that "Baghdad's public position is
that they reject the Resolution 1284."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly rejected the resolution, claiming that it
aims at prolonging the U.N. sanctions on Iraq or keeping Iraq's
oil "under the colonial control" of the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the official Jumhuriya newspaper on July
16, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said that the U.N.
resolution was "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"This resolution aims at making our country a U.S.-British
protectorate. We totally reject the resolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UNMOVIC was set up by the U.N. following the adoption of the
U.N. resolution in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has insisted that the total lifting of the U.N. sanctions
is the precondition for the return of the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under crippling U.N. sanctions ever since it
invaded Kuwait in August 1990.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President to Visit Egypt in September: Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is
to visit Egypt in September, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the announcement during a meeting with Egyptian
university students in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria,
the country's official Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Bashar's visit to Egypt will take place in the second half of
next month, Mubarak was quoted as saying by the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Reports have initially said that Bashar was to visit Egypt at
the end of this month as part of an Arab tour, which will also take
him to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. It will be Bashar's first trip
abroad since taking office last month after the death of his
father, Hafez al-Assad, in June.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Bashar is ready to restart peace talks with Israel
on the basis of complete Israeli withdrawal from Syria's lands
occupied in the 1967 Mideast War, the news agency added. He
reiterated Egypt's support for the Syrian position.
</P>
<P>
After a brief resumption in December following a hiatus of
nearly four years, Syria and Israel froze again their peace
negotiations due to failure to overcome differences over the return
of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of holding an Arab summit, supported
by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq Shareh during his visit to Egypt
on Monday, the Egyptian president said it could be convened "this
year or at the beginning of next year."
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Mubarak, Shareh called on Arab leaders to
hold a summit to seek ways of ending a "wretched situation of
disunity" in the Arab world for the benefit of the Arab nation and
peace and stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The last Arab summit was held in 1996 in Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Annan Promises Major Reform of U.N. Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday urged world governments to join him in
implementing changes in the structures and management of United
Nations Peace operations recommended by a panel of international
experts.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. panel on peacekeeping operations, which was established
in March at the request of the Secretary-General, launched a
report today in which a clear set of recommendations were made on
how to improve the whole range of U.N. activities in the area of
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the report, Annan said prompt action was "absolutely
essential to make the United Nations truly credible as a force for
peace".
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief asked his deputy, Louise Frechette, to follow up
on implementing the recommendations and to submit an action plan
in time for the General Assembly to consider it during its autumn'
s session.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the report would receive
attention from world leaders, who will be in New York next month
for the Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
The panel's report recommended extensive restructuring of the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, a new information and
strategic analysis unit to service all United Nations departments
concerned with peace and security, an integrated task force at the
U.N. Headquarters to plan and support each peacekeeping mission
from its inception, and more systematic use of information
technology.
</P>
<P>
Chaired by Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian Foreign Minister,
the panel included members from all six continents, with wide
experience in humanitarian, development and police work as well as
military peacekeeping.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. panel said on
Wednesday that its recommendations to change the structures and
management of U.N. peacekeeping operations was in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
Launching a report which made specific and concrete
recommendations to reform the U.N. peacekeeping operations,
Lakhdar Brahimi, head of the panel on U.N. peacekeeping operations,
said: "The report is the work of a group of people firmly
committed to the United Nations and highly conscious of the
indispensable role the Organization must continue to play if peace
is to be maintained and reinforced among nations and within
nations."
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the United Nations cannot play that role fully
due to the limitation of its functions, Brahimi said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is doing a very good job indeed. But I am
confident that it can do it better if the will is there," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that our recommendations could be the first step,
indeed an important one, in the right direction," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The member states, the Secretary-General and many senior
officials at the United Nations system had identified the
recommendations as necessary and urgent to reform the system, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Defected Libyan Agent to Testify in Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A former Libyan
secret service agent will testify in the Lockerbie trial next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The testimony was arranged for next Monday so as to give the
defense team time to study crucial documents to be released by the
United States secret service CIA.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Majid Giaka, the former Libyan agent who became U.S.
double agent shortly before the Lockerbie bombing, was originally
due to appear in court on Wednesday but the defense team objected,
persuading judges that the CIA documents could contain information
that turn out critical to the case of its client.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said that Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin
Khalifa Fahima while posing as Libyan Arab Airlines employees in
Malta put stolen luggage transfer tags to an unaccompanied
suitcase that contained the bomb.
</P>
<P>
The suitcase passed through an X-ray scanner at Frankfurt
before being loaded onto the New York-bound Pan Am Flight 103 that
blew up over Lockerbie on December 21, 1988, killing 270 people
altogether.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution had planned to introduce a batch of cable
communications from CIA agents in Malta to Washington containing
details of interviews with the defected Libyan agent.
</P>
<P>
The cable communications, combined with the testimony by Giaka
in court, are expected to serve as the key evidence to the
accusation against the two Libyans.
</P>
<P>
The defense team argued that the copies of the cable
communications should not be allowed as evidence in that the
prosecution had seen largely unedited copies in early June whereas
the defense had only seen copies with sections and words blanked
out on grounds that they are either sensitive or irrelevant
information.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution told the court that Chief Prosecutor Colin Boyd
had met with CIA officials overnight and progress was being made
in the declassification of the cable communications that would be
given to the defense team.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Alastair Campbell said on Wednesday that the defense
team would be given the copies of the cable communications by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution also said that Giaka was assistant manager of
the Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta before defecting to the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Annan Defends Strength of U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opening a meeting with chiefs of defense staff of UNAMSIL's
nine troop contributing countries at the U.N. headquarters, Annan
said the mission must be prepared for worst-case scenarios, citing
the events in May, which "exposed serious problems".
</P>
<P>
The UNAMSIL suffered the humiliation of seeing more than 500 of
its soldiers taken hostage by the rebel Revolutionary United Front
(RUF).
</P>
<P>
The Security Council voted unanimously on August 4 to toughen
UNAMSIL's mandate and asked Annan to recommend ways of
restructuring and strengthening of the mission, now close to its
authorized ceiling of 13,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The priority of the UNAMSIL and elsewhere has always been to
avoid force to the extent possible and to find a political
solution first. But "if the use of force is unavoidable, the
United Nations should be capable of delivering in a credible
fashion", Annan told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were senior military officials from
Bangladesh, Ghana, Guinea, India, Jordan, Kenya, Nigeria, Russia
and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Annan on Wednesday urged world governments to join him in
implementing changes in the structures and management of the U.N.
peace operations recommended by a panel of experts.
</P>
<P>
The penal appealed to the Security Council not to finalize
resolutions authorizing large peacekeeping missions until member
states have pledged the necessary troops and resources.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Open Fresh Talks with IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government will
open fresh talks on Thursday with a delegation of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the release of the second
installment of a standby loan agreement.
</P>
<P>
The standby agreement, approved in August 1999 by the IMF board,
includes a credit of 547 million U.S. dollars, of which Romania
received only the first tranche of 73 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
IMF representative in Bucharest, Stephane Cosse, said that if
talks end successfully, Romania will be disbursed the second
tranche of the standby agreement worth 110 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF mission that will come to Bucharest has two goals: the
first refers to a second revision of the standby agreement and the
second to an analysis of the evolution of the whole economy over
the past year," Cosse was cited on Wednesday as saying by the
official Rompres news agency.
</P>
<P>
Such analysis is not conducted for Romania alone, Cosse said,
adding that the IMF regulation calls for such annual assessment
for the economy of all member-states.
</P>
<P>
IMF's technical mission will make a complete assessment of all
economic indicators, in a more complex manner, which does not
refer only to the way that the Fund's resources are used, Cosse
said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF official said that there are a number of good signals
in the Romanian economy, such as economic growth, beneficial
developments of the trade balance and boosted exports. "Inflation
is the most unsettling aspect. The inflation target should be
revised," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Government set an inflation rate target of 27
percent for this year, a goal it will not be able to meet.
</P>
<P>
In reference to this situation, Finance Ministry's secretary of
state Valentin Lazea, who will participate in the talks with the
IMF, evoked a range of "reasons for which the Government cannot be
held responsible".
</P>
<P>
He cited the floods and drought that hit Romania this year, a
lower exchange rate for the euro and the dramatic oil price rises.
Finance from the international bodies, moreover, was disbursed as
late as this June, four months later than promised.

<HEADLINE> Putin Feels "Responsible, Guilty" for Kursk Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
said Wednesday that he feels "fully responsible and guilty" for
the death of 118 crew aboard the ill-fated Kursk nuclear submarine.
</P>
<P>
Putin told the state RTR television that Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev, Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov and
Northern Fleet Commander Vyacheslav Popov have submitted their
letters of resignation for the tragedy but the resignations were
turned down.
</P>
<P>
"The letters will not be accepted," Putin said, adding that the
causes and circumstances of the sinking of the Kursk should first
be clarified.
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose sub went down to the bottom of the Barents Sea
on August 12. Putin and the military have come under fierce
criticism for failing to rescue the submariners and for being too
slow in requesting outside help.
</P>
<P>
"If anyone is to blame, I must be punished. But we must get an
objective picture of the accident," the Interfax news agency
quoted Putin as saying in the television interview.
</P>
<P>
To accept someone's resignation or fire someone "is the easiest
and most erroneous way out" of the tragic situation, but that "
does not change the essence of the matter," Putin said. "We should
get an objective picture of both the accident and the course of
the rescue efforts."
</P>
<P>
"I will remain with the army and navy," Putin promised. "
Together we will revive the army, the navy and the country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has always had a future," he said. "We will get through
this grave tragedy. But these events should unite the nation and
public."
</P>
<P>
He blasted some politicians for trying to use the misfortune
for political gain and to "benefit some group interests."
</P>
<P>
Those "who say that the people who have long promoted the
disintegration of the army, navy and state were among the first
ranks of the seamen's advocates."
</P>
<P>
"Some of them even collected a million each (in donations)," he
said, adding that in his opinion, these people should have better
"sold their villas on the Mediterranean coast of France or Spain."
</P>
<P>
"But in that case they would have had to explain why all this
real estate was registered in the name of figureheads and dummy
legal companies. And we would have probably asked where the money
had come from," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is very sorry about the widely repeated phrase that
"the honor of the navy, the pride of Russia, sank together with
Kursk."
</P>
<P>
"You know that our country has lived through years of much
worse trouble than we have lived through recently. We and our
ancestors faced much worse catastrophes. We have lived through
everything," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has always had a future," Putin said. "What we are
going through today is a very grave thing. But I am absolutely
sure that events of this kind should unite the nation and the
people, not separate them," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Share Diesel Price Hikes Cost With Truckers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has agreed
with a group of protesting truckers to share the cost of diesel
price hikes, according to a government report late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting between Thai transportation minister Suthep
Thueksuban and representatives of the truckers Wednesday, both
sides agreed that the current diesel price of 14.90 baht (37 U.S.
cents per liter is "unfair," and the normal price should be 10.82
baht (26 U.S. cents) and the government will share the cost of
extra, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, about 1,000 trucks from four neighboring
provinces formed a protest convoy in the highways outside Bangkok,
demanding that the government should help to ease the impact of
fuel price hikes.
</P>
<P>
The government's move was welcomed by Thai Transportation
Association chairman Chatchawal Pojananuphab, who said that the
government has shown it was sincerely concerned with the truckers.
</P>
<P>
As the world oil price soaring to a ten-year's high, Thailand's
petrol and diesel prices have increased three times in two weeks.
The government is facing criticisms for being slow to take
measures to moderate the price hikes.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Panel Launches Report on Peacekeeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. panel on
peacekeeping operations on Wednesday presented a set of
recommendations on how to improve United Nations activities in the
area of peace and security.
</P>
<P>
In its report to the U.N. Secretary-General, the panel of
international experts recommended an extensive restructuring of
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the establishment of a
new information and strategic analysis unit to service all United
Nations departments concerned with peace and security, the
establishment of an integrated task force at the U.N. Headquarters
to plan and support each peacekeeping mission from its inception,
and more systematic use of information technology.
</P>
<P>
The panel said many of the proposed changes require political,
financial or operational decisions from the United Nations member
states.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the panel urges the Security Council not to
finalize resolutions authorizing large peacekeeping missions until
member states have pledged the necessary troops and resources and
recommends an increase in funding to strengthen the peacekeeping
support staff at the U.N. Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General set up the panel in March after
publishing two reports last year which highlighted the United
Nations failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and to
protect the inhabitants of Srebrenica (Bosnia and Herzegovina) in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Chaired by Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian Foreign Minister,
the panel included members from all six continents, with wide
experience in humanitarian, development and police work as well as
military peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General asked the panel to assess the
shortcomings of the existing system of the United Nations
peacekeeping operations and to make frank, specific and realistic
recommendations for change.
</P>
<P>
The report will be reviewed at the Millennium Summit to be held
from September 6 to 8 at the U.N. Headquarters in New York.

less costly option for the international community than military
actions, emergency humanitarian relief, or reconstruction after a
war has run its course".
</P>
<P>
It says peacekeepers must be able to defend themselves and
their mandate, with "robust rules of engagement", against those
who renege on commitments or seek to undermine peace accords by
violence.
</P>
<P>
It urges the Secretariat to draw up a plan for developing
better peace-building strategies. Peacekeepers and peace-builders,
it says, are "inseparable partners", since only a self-sustaining
peace "offers a ready exit to peacekeeping forces".
</P>
<P>
MANDATE
</P>
<P>
The Secretariat "must tell the Security Council what it needs
to know, not what it wants to hear, when formulating or changing
mission mandates".
</P>
<P>
TRANSITIONAL CIVIL ADMINISTRATION
</P>
<P>
A panel of international legal experts should explore the idea
of an interim criminal code for use in places where the United
Nations is given temporary executive powers (as currently in
Kosovo and East Timor), pending the re-establishment of local rule
of law and law enforcement capacity.
</P>
<P>
TIMELINES
</P>
<P>
"Traditional" United Nations peacekeeping operations, sent to
monitor cease-fire and separations of forces after inter-state
wars, should be fully deployed within 30 days; more complex peace
operations, sent to help end intrastate conflicts, within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
PERSONNEL
</P>
<P>
Member states should work together to form "coherent,
multinational, brigade-sized forces," ready for effective
deployment within these timelines; and should each establish a
national pool of civilian police officers.
</P>
<P>
The panel does not call for a standing United Nations army, but
says the Secretariat should establish "on-call" lists of about 100
military and 100 police officers and experts, from national armies
and police forces, who would be available on seven days' notice to
establish new mission headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Conditions of services for civilian specialists should also be
revised so that the United Nations can attract more qualified
personnel and reward good performance with better career prospects.
</P>
<P>
SPEED AND EFFICIENCY
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General should be allowed funds to start planning
a mission before the Security Council approves it, so that when
approved it can be deployed quickly. Field missions should be
given greater freedom to manage their own budgets. Additional
ready-made mission "start-up kits" should be maintained at the U.N.
Logistic Base in Brindisi, Italy.
</P>
<P>
FUNDING FOR PEACEKEEPING SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
The panel states that, after 52 years, it is time to treat
peacekeeping as a "core activity" of the United Nations rather
than a "temporary responsibility". Headquarters support for it
should therefore be funded mainly through the regular United
Nations budget, instead of the current "Support Account" which has
to be justified year by year and post by post.

<HEADLINE> Government to Focus on Economic Development: Iranian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
said here Wednesday that his government will do more in future to
promote the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said at the inauguration ceremony of a big housing
project in the south of Tehran that future policies of the
government will be based on encouraging production, absorbing
domestic and foreign investments and efficiently utilizing the rich
national resources.
</P>
<P>
"We have no option but to encourage production and investments
in the country and raise national income," he was quoted by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his government will show more care for the low
and fixed income group so that they will not be harmed by the
process of development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the housing requirements of the people should be
met. If the needy are provided with housing, a major part of the
society's problems will be solved, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the 10,000 rental units of the newly inaugurated project
will be completed by September and qualified applicants will be
allocated the houses at mere 30 percent of the total cost price.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's government, formed in 1997, has been focusing on
political and social reforms in the past three years, which invited
severe criticism and resistance from the powerful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The country's longtime economic problems, notably high inflation
and unemployment, have not been eased in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Khatami has announced that he will seek reelection in the next
presidential election, possibly to be held in May 2001.

HANOI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam demands an immediate end
to the U.N. embargo and military activities against Iraq, the
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said Wednesday
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh made the remarks while answering
Party daily Nhan Dan (the People) about Vietnam's stance on the
10th anniversary of the United Nations' imposition of embargo
against Iraq.
</P>

Over the past 10 years, Thanh said, the embargo has caused
disasters to the Iraqi people. Nearly 1.5 million Iraqis, most of
them children, women and elderly people, died of hunger and
medicine shortage.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.N. continuation of its embargo against Iraq
constitutes an inhumane act, violating human rights and running
counter to morality.

<P>
She affirmed that the Vietnamese people, together with peace-

the embargo and military activities against Iraq so that the Iraqi
people will soon bring their lives back to normal and re-build

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Indonesia's New Cabinet to Face Tough Tasks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 23 -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid
here Wednesday announced his new cabinet lineup, with significant
changes. It is believed that the move is aimed at boosting his
administration performance for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Some prominent figures from political parties as well as
professionals were recruited into what Wahid said as a "
collaboration cabinet team."
</P>
<P>
To boost the efficiency of the new cabinet, Wahid has expressed
his willingness to authorize Vice President Megawati Soekarno
Puteri to carry out the government's technical daily work. But,
the vice president should be responsible for the president.
</P>
<P>
It also could be categorized as a brave decision, as Wahid has
liquidated at least ten ministries and retained only 25 ministries/
departments.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet is simpler and slimmer, and will enable the
executives to be able to make a "fast decision" as there is no
longer a long bureaucratic procedures that used to be passed
through.
</P>
<P>
As the country is facing with many complicated problems in an
unusual political transition period, all the ministers should be
prepared themselves to work harder.
</P>
<P>
The first priority for the new cabinet is recovering the crisis-
hit economy which will provide job opportunities, boost the
currency of rupiah, and help the development of small and medium
industries.
</P>
<P>
Other crucial tasks are finalizing banking restructuring
programs and continuing the privatization of state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet should also be able to improve the current
political and security condition to bring back foreign investors
as well as re-running economic activities without fear of possible
disturbances and riots.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government should put an end to the rising
separatist activities in some areas, such as Aceh, Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
Another knotty problem must be solved is eliminating corruption,
especially the trial of former president Soeharto who was accused
of embezzling state funds during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
Observers held that the government must seriously pay its
attention to its job. If all the problems could be resolved step
by step, the ongoing political and economic reforms in the country
will make progress and the government's prestige will also be
raised.
</P>
<P>
A conducive climate following the success of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) annual session should be maintained.
Horizontal conflicts, which have been taking place in several
areas in the country, should be completely overcome and the
upholding of the supremacy of law has to be enhanced, political
analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the new cabinet seems to be one of Wahid's
efforts to stay in power until 2004.
</P>
<P>
However, Speaker of the parliament Akbar Tandjung has said that
if Wahid fails to improve the current situation, he is likely to
lose people's confidence and it means he will face big trouble in
the following years.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Impose Price Ceiling on Medicines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Senate President
Franklin Drilon said Wednesday he is open to impose price ceiling
on medicines citing that prices of drugs have reached alarming
proportions compared with those in other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
But Drilon said this move will only be undertaken as a last
resort to arrest the spiraling prices of medicines in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"The survey data on the comparative prices of medicines are
very alarming. We do not need to wonder why the poor and the
deprived die faster than the ones who can afford," Drilon said
here in speech during the oath-taking ceremonies of new
pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
Drilon said he is against any government subsidy for medicines
or price control because these measures ignore the basic problem
of high medicine prices and do not offer a lasting solution to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
However, if the government can not come up with effective
measures to bring down drug prices, he said, he would support some
form of price control if this would be the only way to solve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The Senate chief also supports government plans to bypass local
and foreign pharmaceutical companies and instead import directly
the drug requirements of government hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Drilon filed a resolution asking the Senate committees
on health and trade to conduct a joint probe into the excessive
pricing of medicines and introduce legislative measures to make
medicines more affordable to the people.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia attempts to plant
100,000 tress within a minute in a bid to create a new world
record.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian attempt would take place on October 15 at various
places throughout the country simultaneously, Bernama news agency
reported Wednesday quoting Housing and Local Government Minister
Ong Ka Ting.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamd will lead 100,000 people in the
attempt which would start as soon as they receive the signal via
radio from the campaign's launch site here.
</P>
<P>
The attempt will be part of the "New Millennium Gift of Trees
for the Nation" campaign which is a continuation of the "Gift of
Trees to Green the Nation" campaign launched in 1996, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 campaign has succeeded in getting 2.3 million trees
planted against the target of three million trees by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The attempt is being organized by the Malaysian Nature Society,
Forest Research Institute of Malaysia, Lions Club, One Earth
Enterprise and the Malaysian Private Property Valuers and
Consultants.

<HEADLINE> Philippine VP: No Asylum for Abu Sayyaf Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President Gloria
Macapagal Arroyo said Wednesday that she is not in favor of
granting asylum to the terrorist Abu Sayyaf group leaders.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo told reporters here that the recent events hounding the
Southern Mindanao showed that granting an asylum to the Abu Sayyaf
is not the proper measure.
</P>
<P>
"I am not in favor of granting asylum to the Abu Sayyaf leaders,
they must face the consequences," said Arroyo, who is also
Secretary of Social Welfare and Development.
</P>
<P>
The asylum to be granted by foreign countries is reportedly one
of the several conditions that Abu Sayyaf leaders Ghalib "
Commander Robot" Andang and Mujib Susukan were asking in exchange
for their captive's release.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist group was supposed to release on August 20 their
remaining hostages but, at the last minute, they backed out for
fear of massive military operations against them.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf extremists are still holding in their hands nearly
30 hostages, some of them being western tourists abducted in April
from Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's MICE Industry Expands in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's meetings,
incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) industry expanded
significantly in the first half of this year compared to the
corresponding period last year, Singapore Tourism Board (STB)
announced this in a statement Wednesday while announcing that
Singapore ranked among the top five convention city in the world.
</P>
<P>
STB said that the Belgium-based Union des Association
Internatinales (UAI) conducted annual statistical survey and
ranked Singapore world's fifth convention city -- the highest
ranking the island country ever achieved.
</P>
<P>
The total number of events staged in Singapore increased by 7.8
percent to 3,245 in 1999 and the number of conventions rose by 23.
8 percent to 880, STB added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to major exhibitions and conventions held in
Singapore from January to June this year, the STB cited the Asian
Aerospace, Food &AMP; Hotel Asia, CommunicAsia and Tax Free Asia
Pacific and the inaugural International Dental Exhibition and
Meeting (IDEM)
</P>
<P>
"CommunicAsia, Asia Pacific's largest communications and IT
event which took place in June, brought in 16,000 overseas
visitors. Food&AMP;Hotel Asia generated 22,000 foreign participants,"
STB elaborated.
</P>
<P>
The IDEM brought in 4,000 overseas delegates in April and has
also confirmed Singapore as the venue for its conventions in 2002,
2004 and 2006, STB added.
</P>
<P>
Six large meetings by IT companies have since been confirmed
and will bring in close to 3,500 overseas delegates between
September this year and July 2001 with four of them to be staged
in Asia for the first time, STB said.

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration is scheduled on Wednesday to
release long-awaited guidelines that will, for the first time,
allow federally funded scientists to conduct research on human
embryo cells. Opponents say the research is unacceptable because
the only way to acquire the cells is by destroying human embryos.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton on Tuesday night signed a waiver
authorizing distribution of a 1.3 billion U.S. dollar aid package
to help the Colombian government fight drug traffickers. The
decision came one week before Clinton is to make a one-day visit
to the country.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

that it had systematically concealed customer complaints about
tens of thousands of defective automobiles since 1977.
</P>
<P>

sweeping tax-cut proposal on Tuesday, saying it was both
responsible and easily affordable in light of federal surplus
projections.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian population fell again in the first half of this year,
Moscow said, reflecting a poor economy, inadequate health care and
a declining birth rate. Russia is expected to see its population
of 145 million drop by eight million by 2016.

<HEADLINE> Four-Team Trade Failure Irks Knicks Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The proposed four-team 13-
player blockbuster trade, which would have been the biggest in NBA
history, is dead for now, and legendary New York Knicks center
Patrick Ewing remains struck in a city that doesn't seem to want
him.
</P>
<P>
New York fans and media hailed the trade, which also would have
involved the Los Angeles Lakers, Detroit Pistons and Seattle
SuperSonics and sent Ewing to Seattle, as a brilliant move when it
appeared to be a done deal.
</P>
<P>
The trade unraveled as the Pistons developed cold feet late
Monday after agreeing to it Sunday. The teams still were trying
to salvage the deal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fans have blamed Ewing for the Knicks' failure to win an NBA
title in his 15-year career with the team, even though he was
voted one of the 50 greatest players in league history. The deal
was considered a step in the right direction to move the Knicks
past the injury-plagued disappointment of the Ewing years.
</P>
<P>
"His ego was too big, David Robinson stepped aside for Tim
Duncan, and the Spurs won a championship. If Ewing had done that,
the Knicks probably would have done the same thing," the New York
Post said.
</P>
<P>
In the proposed four-team trade, Pistons would have gotten
seven marginal players, cash from New York and a first-round draft
pick each from the Knicks and Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Apparently Detroit and many of its fans felt that they were
getting the short end of the stick. Meanwhile, the Pistons turned
their attention elsewhere and Tuesday traded point guard Lindsey
Hunter to the Milwaukee Bucks for forward Billy Owens.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislator on China's Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China's top lawmaker has called
on the rational development and utilization of water resources in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, made the call today at a forum on water
resources in China and the revision of the Water Law.
</P>
<P>
China is short of water resources, with its per-capita water
resources accounting for only one third of the world's average, he
said, noting that the country is frequently hit by droughts and
floods.
</P>
<P>
He said the water shortage problem is becoming more and more
serious, along with the acceleration of industrialization,
urbanization and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Equal importance should be given to developing water resources
and saving water, Li said, adding the Water Law should be revised
to enhance the country's over-all management of water and bring
about a water-saving economy.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, advanced technology should be adopted to save
water and the structure of farming should be improved, so as to
use the limited water resources to their maximum effect, the NPC
leader said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Li urged to reduce the discharge of sewage by
industries and try to recycle waste water. Market mechanism
should also be introduced to promote the rational use of water
resources and a scientific water distribution system compatible to
the socialist market economy should also be set up, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Supreme Court Rejects Former Shas Leader's Appeal Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Supreme Court President
Justice Aharon Barak Wednesday rejected an appeal by the former
leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party Aryeh Deri for a new
hearing of his case.
</P>
<P>
Deri, the first former cabinet minister ever sentenced to prison
terms in the country, will begin serving a three-year sentence on
September 3.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a three-judge panel upheld the lower court verdict,
but reduced Deri's prison term from four to three years. The fine
on Deri was also reduced. Deri, 41, was ordered to begin serving
the prison term on August 13.
</P>
<P>
Deri's lawyer has requested a new hearing before a full panel of
justices. The move had delayed Deri's sentence serving.
</P>
<P>
Shas party leader Eli Yishai said on Wednesday that it is a sad
day and a pity that the president of the Supreme Court has denied
Deri the chance of a second hearing.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Israel Radio, Yishai said despite their
disappointment, Shas supporters are moderate and will not resort to
violence and criticism of the court.
</P>
<P>
Yishai said Deri will be escorted to prison when he begins
serving his term and the Shas leadership will continue consulting
with him while he is in prison.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem District Court convicted Deri, the country's
former youngest interior minister in history, of taking bribes
totalling 155,000 U.S. dollars from three friends and co-defendants
- Moshe and Aryeh Weinberg and Yom Tov Rubin, as well as fraud and
breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
The conviction was delivered on March 17, 1999, following a
trial that lasted five years. A three-judge panel ruled unanimously
that Deri pocketed the money over a period of five years from 1985
to 1989 in return for channelling state funds to the Weinberg-Rubin
yeshiva.
</P>
<P>
On April 14, 1999, Deri was sentenced to four years in prison
and fined 250,000 shekels (about 62,500 dollars) or another 10
months in prison in lieu of the fine.
</P>
<P>
The court also ruled that the count of bribery constituted moral
turpitude, meaning that if Deri's appeal is rejected, he will not
be able to run for public office for 10 years after completing his
prison term.
</P>
<P>
The sentence caused a furor in Shas's constituency, which
revered the charismatic young politician and one of the country's
most powerful people. Six weeks later, Shas won 17 seats in the
Knesset (Parliament) elections, up from 10 three years earlier. The
party thus rose to the status of the third largest party after
Labor and the Likud.
</P>
<P>
In another reaction to the Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday,
Shas Knesset Member Eli Suissa said the refusal to Deri's second
appeal is "another stab of knife into the body of the Sephardic
Jewish community." He said the day will mark the beginning of
violence of the Sephardic Jewish revolution in Israel and
throughout the world.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records 8.8 Percent GDP Growth in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's real gross
domestic product (GDP) expanded by 8.8 percent in the second
quarter of this year against 11.9 percent growth in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
GDP growth for the first half of this year is now estimated at
10.3 percent against 1.8 percent in the first half of 1999 and
this exceeds the levels attained in the second half of 1999 by 2.4
percent, Bank Negara (State Bank) Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The second quarter this year was the fifth consecutive quarter
of positive growth for Malaysia's economy which contracted
following the regional financial crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The governor said output expansion had raised the level of the
GDP to 52.4 billion ringgit (13.78 billion U.S. dollars),
surpassing the highest quarterly GDP of 51.2 billion ringgit (13.
47 billion U.S.dollars) recorded in the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
She said "8.8 percent was considered a very strong growth for
Malaysia. What is important here is that there is sustainable
growth. We want this (growth) to be sustained over the medium to
long term and the growth momentum is continuing."
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector recorded a growth of 22 percent in the
second quarter against 10.7 percent in the previous corresponding
period.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector grew by 2.1 percent against a
contraction of 7.9 percent, mining grew by 2.5 percent against a
contraction of 4.6 percent, services rose by 5.0 percent against 1.
4 percent but agriculture, forestry and fishing declined by 4.8
percent against a growth of 9.9 percent previously.
</P>
<P>
Real gross fixed capital formation increased by 25.8 percent in
the second quarter reflecting investment in new growth areas such
as information technology and higher investment for expansion of
production capacity.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in the second quarter was at 1.4 percent due
to lower prices and lower price increases for food. Inflation is
expected to be lower than the earlier forecast of 3.0 percent for
the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus of 12.5 billion ringgit (3.28 billion U.S.
dollars) contributed to the increase in international reserves of
Bank Negara Malaysia to 129.2 billion ringgit (34 billion U.S.
dollars) at the of June this year.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, exports continued to increase strongly
by 16.9 percent while imports grew by 31.5 percent mainly due to
the strong external demand for exports and increased investment
activities.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's external debt position continued to remain at a
manageable level, with total external debts recording a modest
increase of 0.5 percent to 155.8 billion ringgit (41 billion U.S.
dollars) at the end of June 2000, she said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Ruling Coalition Troubled by Infighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's ruling People's
Alliance (PA) was troubled by a political infighting between two
Muslim ministers in the run-up to the general elections due in
October, government officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shipping Minister Mohammed Ashraff, leader of the Sri Lanka
Moslem Congress (SLMC), resigned from the cabinet on Tuesday in
protest over criticism from his colleague, Transport Minister A.H.
M. Fowzie.
</P>
<P>
Fowzie on Tuesday issued a statement slamming the SLMC over the
party's demand for a higher quota of seats at the October 10
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
He said the party was a spent force which cannot get more than
five seats in the forthcoming general elections unless they
contest with the PA.
</P>
<P>
The SLMC said Wednesday it had decided that any future support
for the PA would depend on the action President Chandrika
Kumaratunga takes against Fowzie. Kumaratunga's PA was able to
form a government after the 1994 elections with a slender one-seat
majority mainly due to support from the SLMC, which had seven
lawmakers in the 225-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga, unwilling to lose SLMC's crucial support,
has refused to accept Ashraff's resignation.
</P>
<P>
However, crucial talks between the SLMC and Kumaratunga for the
party to contest with the PA were reported to be deadlocked on
Wednesday with the party insisting on demanding three seats and
two ministries.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Govt Calls for NLD's Contribution to Education Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government Wednesday
called on the National League for Democracy (NLD), an opposition
political party in the country, to contribute meaningfully and
positively to the education sector.
</P>
<P>
The call came one month after all universities in Myanmar were
reopened in late July without official announcement following a
long closure since December 1996 for students' involvement in
street demonstrations then against the government.
</P>
<P>
"The government together with the people of Myanmar welcomes
any meaningful contribution and cooperation from political parties
within the country to help overcome challenges and create a better
educational standard for its youths and a better life for its
people," the government said in an Information Sheet released here
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
However, the information sheet expressed regret that the NLD,
which it said, has taken the stance of condemning and criticizing
the government's endeavors in encouraging the students to
peacefully pursue their education without being side-tracked and
exploited by certain quarters with vested interest.
</P>
<P>
The information sheet pointed out that the government has been
working hard to assure the children better education, which is a
national priority, by investing more and more in schools not only
to open the doors of learning to all but also to obtain higher
standards and quality of learning.
</P>
<P>
The information sheet added that the government appreciates
constructive advice and criticism from the local and international
community, while rejecting criticizing and condemning others
merely for the sake of engaging in the act of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NLD charged in a recent statement that
educational crisis is among crisis that the government faces in
the fields of politics, economy, social and international affairs,
urging the government to tackle the country's present overall
crisis by implementing the result of the 1990 multi-party general
election, in which the NLD won a vast majority of parliamentary
seats with 396 out of 485.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Handle Abu Sayyaf Problem by Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that the Philippine government is capable
of resolving the problem with the Abu Sayyaf without the help of
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Estrada made this statement in response to the reported offer
by the United States and Malaysia to help in the fight against the
terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need it. We can handle this on our own," said the
president before flying to Mindanao for the third phase of his
series of visits to the South aimed at monitoring development
projects there.
</P>
<P>
Press Undersecretary Mike Toledo said although the government
welcomes the offer of Malaysia and the United States to help in
the fight against global terrorism, it maintains that the hostage
crisis involving the Abu Sayyaf group is an internal matter.
</P>
<P>
Toledo also stressed that suggestions to create a multinational
armed forces to combat the Abu Sayyaf is not necessary.
</P>
<P>
"The military option in neutralizing the Abu Sayyaf is not
being discussed because right now, what is important is the safe
release of all the hostages," Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad and U.S. Embassy
spokesman Thomas Skipper were earlier reported as saying that
their governments are prepared to help the Philippines combat the
Abu Sayyaf, since they consider the group a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
The foreign hostages, now being held by the Abu Sayyaf, were
originally abducted from a diving resort in Sipadan, Malaysia in
April and were later brought to Sulu.

BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share market
index plunged 7.35 points, or 9.26 percent, to 72.05 points on
Wednesday, after it was beaten to an intraday nadir of 71.70
points in early afternoon, well below its 10-day moving average.
</P>
<P>
Daily turnover was 87.65 million US dollars, which was 7.67
million or 8.05 percent less than Tuesday's total, according to
Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory
company.
</P>
<P>
Not ready to overcome its sudden reversal starting yesterday
afternoon, the market was succumbed to further sell-off for most
of the day as profit-takers dragged stocks in all areas sharply
down with follow-through moves.
</P>
<P>
There was no leadership today as breadth figures were running
decisively in favor of negativity. Fifty-four losers dominate the
market, with the remaining one suspended from trading.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12 players dived to the daily price floor,
including Goods and Materials Sanmao, Dazhong Taxi, Friendship,
Waigaoqiao, Zhenhua, Lujiazui, Chlor Alkali, Worldbest Kama,
Jintai, P and T and China Travel.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that the slide, where sellers made
strong presence, could be curbed to some extent if buyers mount up
to back up. The market has got a respite in its meltdown in the
late day, an encouraging performance thus far as traders have
shown a little inclination to reverse the bearish trend.

<HEADLINE> China's Water Conservancy Sector Enters New Stage: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China's water conservancy sector
has entered a new phase of development with greater investment and
better planning since 1998.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shucheng, minister of Water Resources, made the remark
today at a forum on water issues in China and the revision of the
Water Law.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, attended the forum.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the ministry has completed the planning
of special projects to control the country's seven largest rivers
as well as a guideline on the development of water conservancy in
China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has worked out a number of plans on water
conservancy, including the national plan for preventing floods,
special plans for the development of water conservancy in the 10th
Five-Year Plan period (2001-2005) and a 10-year plan on the issue.
There is also a plan for the development of water conservancy for
western China and the national plan on the protection and
utilization of water resources.
</P>
<P>
He said the efforts over the past two years have paid off. In
1999, flood-control facilities in the lower and middle reaches of
the Yangtze River played a successful role, although the water
levels are the second highest following those recorded in the
previous year, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the country built up water-efficient
irrigation facilities for 4.33 million ha., while a total of 13.33
million ha. of cultivated land has benefited from various kinds of
water-efficient measures, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The farmland saved 10 billion cubic meters of water and led to
an increase of 5.6 billion kilograms in the country's grain
production capacity.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to water projects built in the past two years, soil
erosion has been curbed, at a certain degree, in an area of 500,
000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Since the catastrophic floods that attacked part of the country
in 1998, central and local governments have stepped up the efforts
to reinforce reservoirs that were weak or damaged in the floods.
</P>
<P>
Over 177 cities in the country have reached the national
standard on flood prevention and 6,000 kilometer-long sea dikes,
44 percent of the total, have been reinforced.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Tackles Unemployment Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Acting Labor and
Social Affairs Minister Ra'anan Cohen decided on Wednesday to call
an urgent meeting to discuss measures to tackle the country's
unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
The minister decided to ask various government ministries and
agencies to attend the meeting in the coming days to join hands to
solve the problem as soon as possible, the Labor and Social Affairs
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The number of job-seekers in Israel reached 166,000 in July, up
by 1.1 percent from that of June, Cohen announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Overall, a 2.5 percent rise in the number of job-seekers has
been recorded since the start of 2000, he said, adding that Arab
and Bedouin towns and villages were hardest-hit by the unemployment
problem.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that he intends to cut unemployment rate to annual
levels of 6 to 7 percent. The rate in May stood at 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a step to curb unemployment, Cohen, also secretary-general of
the Labor Party, plans to establish a fund to assist factories that
are on the verge of closure, while reducing the number of foreign
workers employed in Israel to help create new job opportunities for
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign workers employed in Israel reached 69,800
in July, compared to 68,600 in June, figures released by the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also proposed the Israel Defense Forces to institute
professional training courses during the last three months of
regular army services, so that the newly discharged veterans can
reach the civilian work world with usable professional skills.

<HEADLINE> Australian Opposition Stands for Self-defense Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian defense strategy
must be based on the defense of Australia, Kim Beasley stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition leader was addressing to the Sydney Security
Forum last Friday and it was published by The Australian daily
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said it must be the discipline to determine priorities for
Australian Defense Force capability development.
</P>
<P>
Australia cannot and should not structure its defense force
directly in relation to our alliances or potential diplomatic
needs, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly should not structure the Australian Defense Force
on the basis of forward defense contingencies, such as conflict on
the Korean peninsula, across the Taiwan Strait and in the South
China Sea," Beazley said and added that "we need to contribute to
diplomatic strategies aimed at preventing such tensions becoming
shooting wars."
</P>
<P>
He accused the Howard Government of ignoring "any real
consideration of the defense benefits of enhancing Australia's
engagement with the region".
</P>
<P>
"No more important foreign policy issue faces us than advancing
our engagement with Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Australia, a debate on the defense strategy is undergoing.
The focus is whether and how much the defense spending should be
increased and the Defense Forces' mission should be to defend
Australia itself or as the United States' strategic prop to guard
the whole interest and value of the West in the region.
</P>
<P>
There is a strong cry that Australia must increase sharply its
defense spending and raise the armed forces' overseas battle
capability, and in case the United States involves in any military
clashes in the region, Australia should be able to take concert
operations.

CANBERRA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 70,000 premium
Olympic Games tickets will be offered to the Australian public

<HEADLINE> Made-in-China Firewall Challenges Global Hackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Noted Chinese consumer
electronics production company, Hisense, has challenged hackers
all over the world to hack a server equipped with its newly
developed firewall products before September 1 to win 500,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The company has set up a large screen in front of a major
department store in Beijing, showing the homepage of the protected
server and the number and sources of hackers.
</P>
<P>
Hackers would be awarded with the money if they could hack the
homepage of the server or gained access to a designated document
on the server, company sources said.
</P>
<P>
The activity was kicked off on Monday. By the press time, the
company has recorded 35,862 attacks by hackers from China, the
United States, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, South Africa and
other countries, while the server remains safe, according to
Doctor Liu, a senior manager from Hisense Digital Technology Co.
</P>
<P>
The manager said Hisense started the development of its
firewall product early last year. In June this year, the product
passed the assessment of the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
Liu admitted that he was a little worried that the firewall
might be broken through by hackers, but insisted that the
possibility for this is small.
</P>
<P>
"Our product is designed to survive all known means of attacks
by hackers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not only a marketing activity. If the firewall is
broken through, we will find new tricks to improve our products,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of Internet has produced a huge market
for network safety products. Investigations show that the size of
the market may hit 6 billion yuan in China in three years.

HONG KONG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese University of Hong
Kong (CUHK) announced Wednesday that it signed a tripartite
agreement with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Anson
Biotechnology Enterprise Inc. to pursue bioscience research on
health and food.
</P>
<P>
The three parties agreed to channel 100 million Hong Kong
dollars (12.8 million U.S. dollars) in the coming five years to
set up a research fund and to support the two research centers at
the Shanghai Institutes of Biological Sciences and the Chinese
University of Hong Kong (CUHK), according to CUHK's vice-
chancellor Arthur K.C. Li.
</P>
<P>
This was the first collaboration of the kind to promote
biosciences research, and partners will capitalize on their
respective expertise and resources in a sustained manner over a
long period of time, Li said at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The collaboration is an effective way to combine the modern
technology with economy, said Lu Yongxiang, president of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, hoping the two centers to create the
world-class biological achievements.
</P>
<P>
Molecular biosciences and biotechnology research are recognized
as crucial elements in China's national strategy for food and
healthcare security in the 21st century, since adequate food and
healthcare are top national priorities with 22 percent of the
world population but only 7 percent of the cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
The main effort will focus on basic research with potential for
applications through biochemical, pharmacological and genomic
studies.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR to Ensure Better Operation of Gaming Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) government has decided to invite a trans-national
consulting company to act as an advisor in working out future
strategies on local gaming industry, a senior official said at a
press conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Francis Tam Pak Un, secretary for economy and finance of the
Macao SAR government, said that the company of Arthur Andersen
will work in three stages. In the initial stage, it will spend
four weeks submitting a report based on studying the operation of
gaming industry in the United States, Britain and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Following that, the company will probe into the present
conditions of Macao's gaming industry and compare the casinos in
Macao with others around the world.
</P>
<P>
In the final stage, the company is required to put forward
detailed and concrete suggestions on the strategies for Macao's
gaming industry in the future, such as relevant licensing,
taxation and supervision.
</P>
<P>
The company is chosen to be an advisor to the SAR government
because it is regarded as an independent company with no bias, the
official said, noting that "the suggestions will be taken as a
major reference (by the Macao SAR government) but will not be
carried out 100 percent."
</P>
<P>
"The government will certainly listen to the opinions of people
from various social sectors and future policies will conform to
the interests of the public," he said.
</P>
<P>
Data provided by the SAR government show that Arthur Andersen,
established in 1913, is a global consulting firm in assurance,
consulting, corporate finance and tax. It has more than 78,000
personnel in 84 countries and territories. Its revenue exceeded
seven billion U.S. dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the company is known as a premier service leader
in providing strategic advice to gaming industry. It currently
serves as principal accountants, systems and strategic consultants
or tax advisors to public and private companies that operate more
than 100 casinos around the world.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Tourism and Amusement Company (STDM) has been running
franchise casino business in Macao. Its monopoly contract with the
government expires at the end of next year.

<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan have decided to
start 89 new scientific cooperation programs in scientific areas
like biology, nuclear energy, agriculture, resources,

</P>
<P>
Ma Songde, vice minister of science and technology, said today
that the two sides reached an agreement on jointly starting the
programs at the Ninth Session of the Sino-Japanese Joint Committee
for Science and Technology Cooperation, which ended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Calls for State of Emergency in Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has said that a state of emergency might be the best way
to deal with a worsening economic crisis and social tension in his
breakaway republic, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Street protesters earlier this month called for Denktash and
his "government" to resign over their handling of a series of bank
failures in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Our people are experiencing difficult times, and everyone is
looking for a way out," the paper quoted Denktash as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I am suggesting declaring a state of emergency may be a way
out," he said, adding that some "coercive measures" were necessary
to right the economy.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has criticised the way the Turkish Cypriot "government"
has managed its heavily subsidized economy, and Denktash is also
under fire for his perceived role in Ankara's dominance of the
Turkish Cypriot economy and state.
</P>
<P>
Denktash earlier this month attended the U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks on Cyprus issue with Greek Cypriot leader, the
Cyprus president Glafcos Clerides, in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Crowds called for his resignation when a Turkish Cypriot court
last month released a newspaper editor accused of espionage after
questioning the Turkish military's control over the police and fire
brigade in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash denied that a state of emergency would create an
autocracy.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
state which is only recognized by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Dives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended two
U.S. cents lower Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar dipped as low as 56.90 U.S. cents on the
day and closed at 57.15 U.S. cents from 59.03 on the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Richard Yetsenga, currency strategist at Deutsche Bank, said
the offshore traders had bailed out of the Australian dollar
because it had failed to make progress.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a sharply weaker currency this morning the local
market had tried to buy it back but the selling barrage was too
strong.
</P>
<P>
The selling barrage was exacerbated by a fall to three-month
lows in euro/U.S. dollar rates while the euro dive was triggered
by poor sentiment implied in a German business survey which gave
the market cause to believe the European Central Bank will be in
no hurry to lift rates.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plunge on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Share prices experienced one-
percent plunge on Singapore Stock Market Wednesday as investors
failed to react to U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to hold
interest rates steady.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) gave up 20.06 points to
end at 2,190.45 points in thin dealings.
</P>
<P>
The market volume amounted to only 351.36 million units valued
at 542.48 million Singapore dollars (about 315.85 million U.S.
dollars). Declining issues overwhelmed advancers by 249 to 84 with
230 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Ionics was the most active stock with a turnover of 24.40
million units. Trek was the second most heavily traded stock with
16.36 million shares done. Sunlight was the next with 15.89
million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
SPH, SPH 100 and SembLog topped the day's gainers list as they
rose by 50 cents to 28.80 and 10.80 Singapore dollars respectively
at close. ShangAsia put on 25 cents to finish at 8.30 Hong Kong
dollars. CSA added 11 cents to end at 3.02 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
PacCent was the biggest loser of the day, incurring a loss of
150 cents to close at 22.30 Singapore dollars. SIA and SIA 200
slipped 40 cents each to finish at 18.60 and 18.70 Singapore
dollars separately. Chartered and Creative 50 retreated 30 cents
to end at 14.30 and 38.20 Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to leave
interest rates unchanged failed to boost the market and no factor
could support the recent upward trend.
</P>
<P>
They noted that shares of the Singapore Airline (SIA) fell due
to profit-taking and concerns that rising fuel prices could erode
its profits.

<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The information industry will
become a strategic industry and a new area for the growth of China
's economy in the 21st century, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
That why China attaches great importance to the development of
the industry, said Wu Jichuan, minister of information industry,
at the opening ceremony of the 2000 International Forum on the
Information Industry, jointly sponsored by his ministry and Xinhua
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that with the globalization of the world economy and
the rapid growth of information networks, China's information
industry is facing both development opportunities and fierce
competition.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China is drafting its 10th five-year plan for
social and economic development during the 2001-1005 period. The
information industry is expected to grow at annual rate of some 20
percent in the next five years. Total sales of IT products are
expected to double the present level in 2005, with industry's
value-added output accounting for five percent of that year's
gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The minister believed that this forum of leading Chinese and
international scholars and corporate leaders will play an
important role in helping both the government and enterprises in
promoting industrial development with information technology.
</P>
<P>
Vice President of Xinhua, Cai Mingzhao, said at the opening
ceremony that despite the challenges that they face in the age of
the Internet, conventional media are enjoying greater development
provided by Internet technology.

more Web clients while securing their original users by seizing

<HEADLINE> T-bond Trade Slackens on Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China's T-bond trade narrowed
today while bonds stayed stable at current prices. Transaction
value totaled 1.33 billion yuan, down 425 million yuan from
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
China's domestic stock market expanded the sharp slump today.
But investors were seen hesitated to transfer capital into fixed
income T-bonds, according to Homeway, China's leading on-line
financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009704 leapt 0.30 percent to stay at 145.65 yuan with the
yield down 0.05 percentage points to 3.82 percent, still the
highest all outstanding bonds.
</P>
<P>
All the other bonds changed little at the close prices.
</P>
<P>
As money was fleeing away from stocks when securities plunged,
and there was no expansion in the trade in treasuries, the eased
money supply led the repurchasing market to slack.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume of three-day, seven-day, 14-day and 28-day
repurchasing transactions contracted by 456 million yuan to 1.85
billion yuan. Meanwhile, the interest rate of the three-day
repurchasing agreement slipped by 0.04 percentage points to 2.95
percent.

<HEADLINE> Earthquakes Cause Damages in Northeastern Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A series of earthquakes occurred
late Tuesday and early Wednesday in Iran's northeastern province of
Khorasan, causing damages, but no report of casualties is
available, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
A quake measuring 5.4 degrees on the Richter scale rocked the
city of Bojnourd at about 21:25 local time (1655 GMT) Tuesday
night. The Geophysics Institute of Tehran University
registered the
epicenter of the quake at 100 kilometers northwest of the city, on
Iran's border with Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
The 5.4-degree quake was followed by two tremors, which measured
4.9 and 3.8 degrees respectively. And early Wednesday, some 45
aftershocks, all measuring over 2.5 degrees, jarred the city and
nearby areas again.
</P>
<P>
The IRNA report said the earthquakes caused damages in some
villages, without elaborating. But there are no reports of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Reminiscent of a destructive earthquake that took place in the
province in February 1997, inhabitants spent the entire night
outdoors fearing aftershocks, the report said. A Red Cross team has
been reportedly dispatched to the area.
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes are not unusual in Iran, as the country is located
on an earthquake belt.

<HEADLINE> UAE Editorial Urges Arab Summit, Defiance of Foreign Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A major Arabic daily of the
United Arab Emirates has urged Arab nations to defy foreign force
and hold an Arab summit in their own interests.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Dhabi-based Al Ittihad published Wednesday pointed out
in its editorial that "a foreign hand, which never wish something
good for the Arab nation" was pulling the string behind the screen
and was holding the "magic wand" that can cause the summit to be or
not to be. wondered the paper.
</P>
<P>
"This foreign hand continues to pull every sort of tricks to
ensure that the Arab front is always divided and that no summit is
held to patch up Arab differences," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
It also said the hand is busy "ensuring the safety of Israel and
strengthening the Jewish state's position in the Middle East peace
process."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the paper expressed disappointment at the
Arab leaders' inability to convene a summit to solve many critical
issues threatening the Arab nation's entity.
</P>
<P>
The paper wondered why some quarters shy away from convening an
Arab summit with intangible excuses, including their claim that
such a summit needs adequate preparation.
</P>
<P>
The Arab situation is not that bad to warrant a failure in
holding such a meeting, which would surely lead to making some
critical decisions, it called.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the problem of Arabs lies not in the call for
holding a summit but in the Arab leaders' inability to understand
such a call and to critically study it from all perspectives before
making a final decision.
</P>
<P>
"It is high time for Arabs to live abreast with their current
situation. It is only by so doing that they will realize how
important it is to hold an Arab summit now," the paper stressed.

<HEADLINE> Investments in Philippine Economic Zones Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Investments in the Philippines'
major economic and industrial zones zoomed up by 10 billion pesos
(250 million U.S. dollars) for the first seven months of this year,
or an 8.85 percent increase compared with the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said Wednesday in a
report that investments at the Philippine Economic Zones Authority
(PEZA), Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) and the Clark
Development Coporation (CDC) amounted to 130.8 billion pesos (3.27
billion dollars), compared to 120.161 billion pesos (3 billion
dollars) for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Although there was a slump in investments registered in the
Board of Investment (BOI) for the seven-month period, this was
offset by the surge in investments in PEZA, SBMA and CDC, the
report said. The BOI is one of the major investment management
institutes of the DTI.
</P>
<P>
Data from the DTI showed that foreign investments registered in
the BOI for the first seven months of 2000 dropped 63 percent from
a year earlier to 17.46 billion pesos (436.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report noted that because of the limited incentive package
offered by BOI, investors now opt to take advantage of the more
generous incentive package of PEZA, SBMA and CDC.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, according to the report, BOI-registered firms have
been no longer entitled to tax and duty-free importation of
capital equipment incentives, the main reason for the decline in
BOI investment registrations.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the PEZA, CDC and SBMA aside from offering
income tax holidays, also allow importation of capital equipment
and the choice of paying 5 percent on gross income in lieu of
paying all the national and local taxes, the report said.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's state of Sabah,
which plans to venture into large scale paddy cultivation, has
requested China to lend its expertise in the field.
</P>
<P>
China, as a major exporter of rice, could share its expertise

Sabah currently produces 30 percent of its rice consumption and
imports the rest, mainly from Thailand and China.
</P>
<P>
Sabah's major exports to China are palm oil and rubberwood and
it also exports substantial volume of fish, prawns and fresh
flowers to China with Hong Kong as the gateway.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former President
Soeharto will be tried for corruption case next Friday, August 31
at 10;00 a.m.(local time), an official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the South Jakarta District Court, Lalu Mariyun said in
a press conference that, "Former President Soeharto will be
brought to justice on August 31 on Friday. The trial will be
conducted at the agriculture ministry building instead of at the
South Jakarta District Court building," Mariyun said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the decision was made for the sake of
security reasons and "to meet the people aspiration who wish to
see the trial process," he added.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that there will be a lot of spectators during the
trial.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief of the South Jakarta Police Senior
Superintendent Edward Aritonang said on the same occasion that the
police is ready to safeguard the trial process, adding that his
side will deploy its personnel around the location of the
agriculture building.
</P>
<P>
But he didn't said in detail on the number of security
personnel which will be deployed to safeguard the trial.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto is principally charged with violating article 1 (a) of
Law No. 3/1971 on corruption for deliberately enriching himself at
the state's expense.
</P>
<P>
He is also subject to subsidiary charges as provided for by
article 1 (b) of corruption law under which a defendant may be
convicted for abusing of power so as to cause losses to the state.
</P>
<P>
In another development, just days ahead the trial, Chief of the
Investigation Team into former president Soeharto, RIS Pandopatan
Sihombing was replaced on Wednesday by Sudibyo Saleh.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the attorney's office said that the replacement of
Sihombing was normal.
</P>
<P>
"That is a normal tour of duty," he told Xinhua, adding that
there is also not a political motive behind the replacement.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies "Kursk" Collision With Russian Ship Or Sub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Navy Wednesday
categorically denied media reports that the sunken nuclear
submarine Kursk may have collided with a Russian military vessel
or a submarine.
</P>
<P>
Reports appeared earlier that the Kursk may have collided with
a large Russian anti-submarine ship, the Marshal Ustinov, or a
Russian strategic submarine Project 941 (Typhoon by NATO
classifications), which had been near the area during the naval
exercises and had supposedly hit the Kursk's bow compartments
underwater.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Northern Fleet spokesman Vladimir Navrotsky, who was
deputy commander of the Marshal Ustinov until recently, said that
the ship returned from exercises on August 11, one day before the
sub accident.
</P>
<P>
"It (Ustinov) is not being repaired and is ready to go to sea
at any moment," the Interfax news agency quoted Navrotsky as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Russian Navy Igor Dygalo denied reports that
the Kursk may have collided with a Typhoon class submarine.
</P>
<P>
"Russian submarines of this type are based in Zaozyorsk in the
Murmansk region and have a displacement of up to 30,000 tons," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Not a single submarine of this class is currently undergoing
repairs," Dygalo said.
</P>
<P>
This information has also been confirmed by Navrotsky, said
Interfax.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia and Norway also denied reports of high
radiation levels in the waters of the sub wrecking in Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Russia Navy and the Norwegian State Radiation Safety
Agency has not registered any rise in radiation levels in the
Barents Sea, the Itar-Tass news agency cited "well-informed"
sources as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the agency had analyzed all water
samples taken near and inside the sunken Russian submarine Kursk
and had stated that "radiation levels are normal."
</P>
<P>
"Water samples were taken during the operation to rescue the
submarine crew. The Norwegian divers also took air samples in the
area of the accident. The radiation situation in the Barents Sea
is being monitored," Tass quoted Norwegian sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the Norwegian nor any other stations in the distress
area have registered any increase in radiation levels," the
sources said.

JAKARTA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Grand Master (GM)
Utut Adianto has set a target of finishing 20th in the men's team
competition at the 34th Chess Olympic Games in Istanbul in October.
</P>
<P>
"We want to improve our rank. It'll be fantastic if we can

Indonesia first took part in the Olympics in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Utut expressed optimism the team could match this mark, but

<P>
-- Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met Tuesday night in a
session characterized by Palestinian officials as a resumption of
intensive negotiations aimed at resolving the question of Jerusalem
and other final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
The renewed talks appeared to be the result of mediation efforts

Abdullah said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is interested in
renewing negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the king that he is ready to make progress on the
stalled Syrian track, but warned of the need to be careful because
of the sensitive state of negotiations with the Palestinians.

According to a senior diplomatic source in Jerusalem, "Israel
does not want to appear as if it is trying to bypass the
Palestinians on its way to the Syrians."

MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Share prices in the Philippine
Stock Exchange closed lower Wednesday despite the United States
Federal Reserve's decision to keep rates steady.
</P>
<P>
The 30-company Phisix, the market's main index, went 5.61
points lower to close at 1,491.31. However, the broader all-shares
index slightly rose 2.21 points to 655.91.

Dealers exchanged 549.8 million shares worth some 17.5 million
U.S. dollars on Wednesday against Tuesday's 568 million shares

</P>
<P>
Analysts said the steady U.S. rates would not necessarily lift
the market's sentiment over the Philippines' domestic situation,
including the conflict in Mindanao and the unresolved hostage
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee decided Tuesday to keep
its short-term interest rate target unchanged at 6.50 percent amid
signs of slower economic growth. But the Fed said it may consider
another rate hike in the future.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Opposition Parties Enforce A Half-Day Hartal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh was mostly paralyzed by
a nationwide half-day hartal (destructive strike) Wednesday which
widely disrupted transport services and hit the banking operations.
</P>
<P>
The four-party opposition alliance led by the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) enforced the hartal to protest against the
killing of BNP leader and lawyer Habibur Rahman Mondol in the
capital on Sunday by unknown assailants.
</P>
<P>
The Southwestern Regional Road Transport Coordination Committee
has also enforced dawn-to-dusk transport strike in 21 out of 64
districts against the price hike of petroleum products by the
government, which helped the opposition shutdown become more
successful, adding sufferings to the people of that region.
</P>
<P>
Police backed by the para-military Bangladesh Rifles patrolled
the city and manned various posts around the city to prevent
potential violence.
</P>
<P>
There was no report of any disturbance during the shutdown
which started at 6 a.m. and ended at 1 p.m., police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said opposition picketers damaged rickshaws during
the shutdown as passengers fled. Police stopped a planned march by
the main opposition BNP, but there was no untoward incident, they
added.
</P>
<P>
Most vehicles stayed off the streets except a large number of
rickshaws, three-wheel motorcycles, taxis and some private and
state-run buses plying in the streets.
</P>
<P>
The government offices worked with slim attendance, while
schools and other educational institutions remained shut, police
sources said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Meets Dead Sub Crew Relatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
met relatives of the dead crewmen of the sunken nuclear submarine
Kursk Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Putin told the relatives
that he has kept asking the military and submarine designers: "Can
it really be true that nothing more can be done?" "It's impossible
to believe in this. The sorrow is immeasurable and no words of
consolation will suffice. My heart is filled with pain."
</P>
<P>
The questions Putin was asked at the meeting suggested that the
relatives were still refusing to believe that the crew were dead,
Interfax quoted an officer participating in the meeting as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting was very emotional and tense," said the officer.
</P>
<P>
Many speakers at the meeting sharply blamed the military
command. But Putin said it would be possible to punish Northern
Fleet commanders only if their guilt is proved.
</P>
<P>
Although emotions were running high, the relatives of the
Kursk's crew agreed that the Russian rescuers had done everything
they could to save the crew, the source said.
</P>
<P>
On the future life of the dead crewmen's families, including
their children's education at secondary schools and establishments
of higher education and jobs for their widows, Putin said there
will be no apathy in tackling these issues.
</P>
<P>
Most of the relatives were urging the president to continue
efforts to retrieve the bodies of the dead crewmen. Putin and the
Northern Fleet commanders assured that work to retrieve the crew
bodies will be carried through to the end, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Putin, wearing a dark suit and a black shirt without a tie in a
Russian NTV television show of the meeting, spoke in detail about
the rescue operation and about when and how the foreign rescuers
were asked to join in.
</P>
<P>
The governmental commission on the sub accident has announced
that the state would buy an apartment building outside Moscow
where relatives of the dead crewmen might settle.
</P>
<P>
Putin arrived at Russia's Northern Fleet base of Severomorsk
late Tuesday to meet the relatives of the crew in the Kursk
submarine, which went down to the Barents seabed on August 12
during a naval exercise. He returned to Moscow from Severomorsk
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister, head of the governmental
commission on the sub accident, Ilya Klebanov, deputy chief of the
presidential staff Alexander Abramov and Commander of the Russian
Navy Vladimir Kuroyedov have remained in Severomorsk to fulfill
Putin's instructions to offer aid to the crew relatives.

<HEADLINE> Gold Demand in UAE to Rise 8 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates' gold
demand is expected to increase by nearly 8 percent by the end of
2000 in light of the attractive prices and the inflow of tourists,
a World Gold Council (WGC) official has said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the country's total gold demand was 79.7 tons, said WGC
manager for Gulf states D. V. Pathy, "we will end up this year with
an increase of about 8 percent."
</P>
<P>
Attractive Prices, retailers' marketing promotion activities,
new concepts and the influx of tourists shore up the gold demand,
Pathy said.
</P>
<P>
He quantified the "attractive" prices at 275-280 U.S. dollars
per ounce, also with a room of increase. But he stressed "even the
Price is 300 dollars, we believe consumers' interest in the yellow
metal will be sustained."
</P>
<P>
"we will see an increase in offtake provided prices stabilize at
that lever," so the WGC hope "to wrap up the year with total sales
of about 85 tons," the local English newspaper Gulf News Wednesday
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also estimated that the festival of lights of Hindus, Diwali;
the Muslim fasting month Ramadan; the Eid al-Fitr feast that marks
the end of Ramadan, and the Christmas will also boost the sales.
</P>
<P>
WGC statistics showed that gold sales, including re-exports, in
the Middle East reached 421.3 tons during the first half of 2000, a
9 percent increase from last year's same timescale.

<HEADLINE> Over 200 HIV Infections Take Place Daily in Zambia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing a conference on the Challenge of HIV/AIDS in Lusaka
on Tuesday, Sichone said a large number of Zambian families are
keeping more than one orphan whose parents have died of AIDS,
Zambian newspaper, The Post, reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our people live with the reality of poverty on a day to day
basis. Clearly poverty makes the effective control of HIV/AIDS
difficult, but it too is in part the result of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic," the paper quoted Sichone as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sichone said the country faces a severe external debt burden
that stifles investment in social sectors such as health,
education and the fight against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"There exists a preponderance of socio-economic conditions
inimical to the effective prevention and control of HIV/AIDS in
Zambia as in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He was however hopeful that despite the gloomy picture, there
is renewed commitment from the political leadership to fight the
epidemic as evidenced from the setting up of the AIDS council
secretariat in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to have hope because there is an encouraging
decline of HIV infections among the young people in Zambia that
indicates to us that prevention of the spread of HIV is possible,"
Sichone said.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States of America International Development
mission director Allan Reed warned that over the next decade, AIDS
will kill more people in sub-Saharan Africa than in all the wars
of the 20th century combined.
</P>
<P>
"It is a development crisis and we all must mobilize every part
of society to respond, the numbers speak for themselves: 12
million Africans have already died, and another 22 million adults
and one million children are now living with HIV," Reed said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that half of the youth in Southern Africa who are
now 15 years old will likely die of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen important progress in Uganda, Senegal, and also
here in Zambia. In Lusaka, the HIV prevalence among 15-19 year old
dropped from 28 percent in 1993 to 15 percent in 1998, but in
other Zambian age groups, the rate is not changing," Reed said.
</P>
<P>
He said as for the 30,000 children that are born each year to
HIV mothers, programs are needed to reduce vertical transmission.

<HEADLINE> Compaq To Build Supercomputer For Military Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Compaq Computer Corp. said
Tuesday it won a contract for more than 200 million U.S. dollars
to build a supercomputer for the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
Compaq said the computer, called Advanced Strategic Computing
Initiative (ASCI) Q, will have more than 11,968 processors,
allowing it to perform more than 30 trillion operations per second.
That is about 2.5 times as powerful as today's fastest
supercomputer, ASCI White, which was built by IBM for the Energy
Department.
</P>
<P>
ASCI Q will be the size of five basketball courts, or more than
21,000 square feet. The supercomputer is expected to begin working
in early 2002, Compaq said.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said the supercomputer, the largest one being
built under contract today, would be housed at Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico and used within the National Nuclear
Security Administration's weapons stockpile stewardship program.
The program's work is to certify the safety and reliability of
nuclear weapons without underground nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
John A. Gordon, the chief of the nuclear security agency, said
the weapons reliability program has historically required the
fastest computers available and the contract announced Tuesday
would accelerate the evolution of technical computing.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that ASCI Q will be composed of linked
AlphaServers, Compaq's brand of computers for heavy-duty corporate
tasks. The highly visible deal strengthens Compaq in this market,
where it competes with IBM and Sun Microsystems, among others.
</P>
<P>
Compaq scored another victory early this month, when it was
selected to build and manage the world's largest nonmilitary
supercomputer. The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center will operate
the computer for the National Science Foundation.

Of the top five religions, Buddhism, the most influential, has
a history of 2,000 years in China,Taoism, native to the country,
has a history of more than 1,700 years. Islam was introduced to
China in the seventh century. Catholicism and Protestantism boomed
in China with the humiliating Opium War in the 1840s, but they
still have 4 million and 10 million followers in China today.
</P>

It is stipulated by law that Chinese citizens may freely choose
and express their religious beliefs and make clear their religious
affiliations, Fu told the meeting of 100 religious leaders in
California and scholars.

BELGRADE -- The Serbian government Tuesday decided to cut
agricultural taxes in a bid to alleviate the negative impacts of
the month-long heat wave on farmers and agricultural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The move will exempt farmers from the land revenue tax,
property tax and part of property taxes of the agricultural
production by agricultural enterprises, the Yugoslav news agency
Tanjug reported. Persisting high temperatures and severe drought
have hit Yugoslavia for nearly a month, causing inconveniences to
people's daily life and affecting agricultural production. (

<HEADLINE> Popov to Meet Klim in Melbourne Pre-Olympic Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian swimming czar Alex
Popov will race against Australia's Michael Klim in a pre-Olympic
100 meters freestyle clash in Melbourne this weekend, Australian
sports officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The pair are ranked No.1 and No.2 in the world rankings in the
prestigious men's sprint event going into next month's Sydney
Games.
</P>
<P>
Popov will contest in both 50m and 100m freestyle events at the
Melbourne grand prix, the Australian Olympic team's last
competition before the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
A win in Melbourne would give the victor a psychological edge
going into the Olympics, they said.
</P>
<P>
The 100m event will be one of the most tightly fought of the
weekend, with Australian world numberfive Chris Fydler and
talented Algerian swimmer Salim Illes also competing.
</P>
<P>
Klim pulled out of the Games' 200m freestyle - one of his world
championship gold medal events - after the Olympic trials in May
to concentrate on the 100m freestyle and butterfly in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
But Popov, who recently broke the world 50m freestyle record at
the Russian trials, won't give up the gold medal easily.
</P>
<P>
He's won the 50 and 100m freestyle double at the last two
Olympics and has a chance in Sydney to become the first male
swimmer in history to "do a Dawn."
</P>
<P>
Australia's Dawn Fraser was the first swimmer to win the same
Olympic event three-times when she won the 100m freestyle during
the span from 1956-1964.
</P>
<P>
It's a feat only equaled by Hungarian Krisztina Egerszegi who
won the 200m backstroke between 1988 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Popov has two chances to do it in Sydney, both before Australia
's Kieren Perkins goes for the 1500m freestyle triple on September
23 - the last day of swimming competition.
</P>
<P>
The Melbourne grand prix has attracted swimmers from Britain,
South Africa, Algeria, Angola, Malaysia, Fiji, Singapore, Papua
New Guinea and Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Organizers Put More Tickets for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Sydney Olympic organisers
Wednesday abandoned their premium tickets scheme and put 75,000
new A category tickets on sale to the general public.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision, Olympics Minister Michael Knight said
the scheme to sell top tickets to the rich had soured public
enthusiasm for the Games.
</P>
<P>
Knight said he was personally given the responsibility to
decide on a superticket premium scheme by the Sydney Organizing
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) board, which had the
blessing of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
"But in the end, I've decided not to do it," he told ABC radio.
</P>
<P>
"When I think back to the way in which the premium ticket
packages soured the whole public feeling about ticketing, I don't
want to see that happen again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Knight said the 75,000 A category tickets kept aside from last
year's disastrous original premium tickets program would go on
public sale at list price.
</P>
<P>
"We could get a few extra million out of it, but right now,
when enthusiasm's building, when (we) ... have re-established a
credible ticket selling proposal, I don't want to place that in
jeopardy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a false economy and I really want to get those tickets
out to average Australians," he added.
</P>
<P>
Knight said 13,700 artistic gymnastics tickets, around 13,000
basketball finals tickets and the 3,000 tickets to the men's gold
medal soccer matches would be available from next Tuesday, only
through box offices and the call center.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Drug Testing Blitz Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- An Australian Sports Drug
Agency (ASDA) spokeswoman said here on Wednesday the largest drug
testing program in the 104-year history of the Olympics had been
launched.
</P>
<P>
She said at least 2000 tests under three programs run by ASDA,
the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping
Agency (WADA) would be conducted before the Games begin on
September 15.
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, there's more tests in the leadup to these
Games than ever before," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"If someone's taking drugs ... I think they're taking a big
risk," she said.
</P>
<P>
It's reported that drug testing officials took urine samples
from Dutch world record breaking swimmer Inge De Bruin soon after
she arrived in Australia earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
De Bruin has set eight world swimming records in the past four
months.
</P>
<P>
But the spokeswoman refused to confirm the Dutch team had been
asked to supply samples.
</P>
<P>
Testing officials are expected in Brisbane in Australia's
Queensland state next week where the high profile United States
swimmers will train, reports said.
</P>
<P>
And some Australian swimmers were also targeted during their
recent training camp at Caloundra, on the Queensland state's
Sunshine Coast.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project: Hubei's Economic Booster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The gigantic water control dam
near Three Gorges on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has
contributed an average of 8.6 percentage points to Hubei Province'
s gross domestic product (GDP) annually since it began
construction in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges hydro-electric power project, the largest of
its kind in the world, is located near Yichang in central China's
Hubei Province. It will require a static investment of 117.6
billion yuan. Once completed, it will help control floods and
increase the country's power generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shuiwen, head of Hubei Provincial Office for Three Gorges
Project, said recently that before building the water control
project, bids were invited for 6,099 items inside Hubei Province
alone, of which, 4,112 were won by enterprises from Hubei, with
the contracts amounting to a total of 27.225 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen went on to explain that over the past eight years, the
annual added value of Hubei's GDP was averaged at 39.571 billion
yuan, of which, around 3.4 billion yuan was created by local
enterprises by fulfilling the contracts related the Three Gorges
Project.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project areas in Hubei have become the places
that have been experiencing fast economic growth, said Chen. From
1992 to the first quarter of this year these areas contracted 1,
344 new specific projects which have brought an inflow of 1.77
billion yuan from economically developed parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
While other areas in Hubei have also witnessed notable
improvements and progress in infrastructure, urbanization and fast
growth in building materials and some special industries.
</P>
<P>
Improved infrastructure in the Three Gorges Area has created
favorable conditions for developing tourism. In Hubei 60 percent
of its overseas tourism earnings and 20 percent of domestic
tourism earnings come from tourist attractions close to the Three
Gorges Project, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project is designed to consist of a 1,983-
meter long and 185-meter tall dam and 26 generating units with a
combined capacity of 18.2 million kilowatts and an annual output
of 84.7 billion kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project will take 17 years to complete. The
first batch of generating units are scheduled to be operational in
2003.

<HEADLINE> China Introduces Gene Diagnosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China has begun using an advanced
method based on gene analysis to diagnose diseases.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health has authorized 10 hospitals to open gene
diagnosis laboratories on a trial basis, sources said.
</P>
<P>
With the help of computers, doctors can precisely detect 20
viruses by examining a patient's saliva, blood or urine, according
to doctors at No.1 Medical College Hospital in northeast China's
Heilongjiang province, one of the first authorized hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Diagnosis based on gene analysis is quicker and more accurate
than conventional means, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
However, because of some technical problems, the new method
cannot totally replace the conventional diagnostic means, they
added.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the several countries that successfully drew
the picture of genome.

Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- The body of former Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey, who died
at Ankara's GATA Hospital on Tuesday morning, was sent to
Azerbaijan after a state ceremony at Ankara's Esenboga Airport the
same day.
</P>
<P>
Turkish soldiers carried the coffin to the plane after attendees
observed a minute of respect for Elchibey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Minister Abdulhaluk Cay said that Elchibey held a
special place in the history of Azerbaijan, a Turkish ally in the
Caucasus, adding that he had struggled for the independence of
Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
For the past two months, Elchibey had been undergoing treatment
in Ankara for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
Elchibey was Azerbaijan's first democratically elected president
following the country's independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Greece will lift the daily visa application for Turkish
tourists who want to visit the Aegean islands of Greece in summer.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a meeting between Greek Foreign
Minister George Papandreou and Turkish Public Order Minister
Michalis Chrysochoidis.
</P>
<P>
But Greece will request tourism agencies to inform it about the
number of tourists who will visit the islands one day in advance to
prevent illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the move was a step forward in the
improvement of Turco-Greek bilateral relations.

Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- The skeletons of Byzantine soldiers, who were killed by the
armies of Crusaders, were found in five separate mass graves during
the ongoing archaeological excavations in Iznik township of western
Bursa province in Turkey.

the excavations on behalf of Turkish Cultural Ministry, said on
Tuesday that they made very important findings during the
excavations that started in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Historians said that Byzantine Emperor Theodos Laskaris withdrew
to Iznik upon this development and continued his administration
here.
</P>
<P>
Crusaders felt uneasy over this and staged attacks on Iznik.
Clashes occurred between the sides. As a result, dead bodies of the
Byzantine soldiers could not be sent away as the city was besieged,

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Dissatisfied by Australia's Delay in Lifting Apple Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has not ruled out
taking Australia to the World Trade Organization over a long-
standing apple ban dispute, according to Television New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Australia has been reviewing a 78-year ban on New Zealand
apples to keep out the plant disease fireblight, although somewhat
slowly.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand government and apple industry have been growing
increasingly impatient at the delay in announcing the outcome of
the review of the ban. A risk assessment carried out by the
Australian Quarantine Service was due out 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The review's release has been postponed four times and the
latest release date for the review is the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Agriculture and Trade Negotiations Minister Jim
Sutton Wednesday was quoted as saying if the dispute is not
resolved soon, he would consider taking a complaint against
Australia to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
"There is a general expectation both here and in Australia that
the review will recommend relaxing the ban, at least to allow
imports of New Zealand apples from fireblight free areas," Sutton
said.
</P>
<P>
He said if that is the outcome, he is prepared to wait a little
longer.

<P>
WELLINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar has
sunk to all-time low against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
It fell below 44 U.S. cents for the first time in more than 15
years Wednesday, trading at 43.47 U.S. cents after losing 1.53 U.S.
cents overnight.
</P>
<P>
The last lowest record for the New Zealand dollar was at 43.70
U.S. cents in 1985.
</P>
<P>
"The latest drubbing overnight was not sparked by an individual
event. Rather, the strength of the U.S. dollar keeps sucking
investors away from all other currencies, while the New Zealand
dollar's long-time vulnerabilities leave it even more exposed,"
the Evening Post said.
</P>
<P>
"A large current account deficit, uncertainty about interest
rate prospects and slipping support for the government are all
weighing on it," the Wellington-based newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Health Ministers of South-East Asian Countries Meet in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The 18th meeting of health
ministers of the countries of the WHO South-East Asia Region (SEAR)
kicked off here Wednesday .
</P>
<P>
The health ministers will discuss during the three-day meeting
issues such as rationalizing WHO (World Health Organization)
resources to inter-countries counterparts, health sector reforms,
HIV/AIDS problems, as well as deliberating on new strategies for
strengthening inter-country collaborations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Dr. Uton Muchtar Rafei,
Regional Director of WHO, said that at the threshold of the 21st
century, the health sectors of the region are facing both
challenges and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental degradation, lack of safe drinking water and
basic sanitation for millions of people will continue to be
serious challenges in the coming century," said Rafei.
</P>
<P>
"Widespread poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition, and the
generally low status of women hamper the health development in the
region, while the ever-increasing population, rapid and unplanned
urbanization and industrialization compound the situation," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Rafei said, however, there are great opportunities "for us to
seize them and meet the challenges head on".
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that this meeting will provide an opportunity
to reinforce the common bonds of friendship and cooperation in our
countries, and will lead to renewed commitment, collective self-
reliance and regional solidarity in health development," Rafei
said.
</P>
<P>
Health ministers of all SEAR countries except Sri Lanka --
Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Thailand -- are
participating in the meeting, which is jointly organized by the
Nepali Health Ministry and WHO. Sri Lanka is being represented by
its Additional Health Secretary as an observer.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Official Warns of Water  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Water, Lands and
Environment Minister Henry Kajura warned of an impending water
shortage in the Nile Basin if countries sharing the river do not
plan its use, the New Vision daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the opening of a five-day regional workshop on
the Nile Basin in the Ugandan city of Entebbe on Tuesday, Kajura
called for "sustainable and equitable utilization of the Nile
waters."
</P>
<P>
Droughts, land degradation, poor farming methods and other
circumstances that make water unsafe would aggravate the scarcity,
said Kajura.
</P>
<P>
"As the population in the basin increases, it is evident that
the Nile waters will not be adequate to meet all the development
needs of these countries in the long term," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Kajura said that despite the great potentials of using the
water for economic development, the Nile Basin countries were
among the poorest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The workshop has brought together water experts from Burundi,
Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda to discuss joint economic and
environmental projects for the basin.

<HEADLINE> Nike Aims to Double Women's Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Nike Inc., the world's No. 1
company for sports shoes, claimed Tuesday to have formed a unit
specifically for designing and selling products for women, aiming
to double its share of the market in two years.
</P>
<P>
Nike said its women's apparel sectors located in department
stores across the United States have already achieved good
performance. Women's retail sales both in Japan and through its
female-oriented Web site in Hong Kong have also been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
"Nike's women's business is one of our major growth
accelerators in the U.S. and internationally, making it one of our
company's top priorities," Nike's chief executive, Philip Knight,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Nike appointed Clare Hamill, who formerly headed Nike's
equipment division, to lead the new women's business as vice
president, effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
Hamill, who has been with Nike since 1981, said the company
planned to double or triple its investments in nearly all areas of
the women's business, including designing, advertising, and
retailing.
</P>
<P>
"Nike has always demonstrated leadership in women's products,
but we're going to make even greater strides in acting and
thinking like a women's company," Hamill said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Currently, women's apparel and footwear make up about 20
percent of Nike's total sales of 25 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Beaverton, Ore.-based Nike sees the booming popularity of
women's sports -- highlighted by the success of the women's
professional basketball and the U.S. women's national soccer team -
- as a prime opportunity to bolster its top line.
</P>
<P>
But Nike's share price dropped almost 12 percent after the
announcement, though analysts said the decline had little to do
with the company's decision to step up its marketing to women.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday morning, a J.P. Morgan analyst lowered her
estimate of the company's U.S. footwear sales growth, citing the
recent overall sluggishness in U.S. retail sales.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Make Closer Relations with India: Mori </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I will like to make India-Japan relations much better than
what they are now," said Mori after he was accorded a ceremonial
welcome at the presidential place here Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Mori, who arrived here Tuesday evening for a three-day official
visit from Bangalore, 2,000 kilometers south of here, is scheduled
to hold wide-ranging talks later Wednesday with his Indian
counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee on regional, international and
issues of mutual concern, a high-ranking Indian official said.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first by a Japanese Prime Minister in the last
ten years, highlighted that Tokyo is keen to bring back on track
bilateral relations derailed in the aftermath of India's nuclear
tests in May, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure to New Delhi, The Japanese leader, who
arrived in Bangalore Monday evening from Pakistan, reportedly
proposed a major promotion and cooperation initiative between the
two countries in information technology (IT) sector.
</P>
<P>
Mori said his government was about to launch an "expansive
measure" on the issuance of multiple entry visas for short-stay
visits in Japan from India for business purposes.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese leader spoke of the high software technology that
was available in India, saying extraordinary strong complementary
relations existed between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He told Indian industrial leaders in Bangalore that the current
cooperation between the two countries in the IT field still
remained low profile compared to its potential, adding that he
would like to show Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee the proposed IT
promotion and cooperation exchange.
</P>
<P>
Japan is a major source of development assistance and leading
trade partner and investor in India, with the two-way trade
increasing to 4.56 billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Japan imposed strict economic sanctions against New Delhi
immediately after India's nuclear tests in 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Closes More Land to Recreational Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Dangerous wildfires and a
shortage of firefighters have led U.S. federal authorities to
close more Western forests and grassland to camping, tourism and
other recreational use effective early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management Tuesday said it is ordering
another 1.3 million acres of the land it controls in western and
central Montana closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
Last week, 6 million to 8 million acres of state, private,
tribal and federal land were closed to prevent additional fires
and to reduce the chance that people could be trapped by wildfires.
</P>
<P>
And Montana Gov. Marc Racicot was expected Wednesday to close
state grasslands and forests to campers, hikers and fishermen in
16 counties.
</P>
<P>
The National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho said Tuesday that
79 fires were burning on 1.4 million acres of land in Arizona,
California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, fires have consumed some 5.7 million acres --
more than double the 10-year average and an area bigger than the
state of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
The hardest hit states remain Idaho and Montana, where a
combined 56 fires are burning more than 1.2 million acres in
mostly steep, rugged terrain that is difficult to reach.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Montana had 29 large fires on 613,000 acres, the
fire center reported. More than a third of the blackened land lay
in the Bitterroot Valley of southwestern Montana.
</P>
<P>
Manpower remained in short supply Tuesday, as firefighters
struggled against the massive host of wildfires. The shortage has
affected the way agencies approach the blazes.
</P>
<P>
In Idaho, the nation's largest wildfire continued to devour the
Salmon-Challis National Forest. The fire had consumed about 159,
000 acres, but was about one-third contained.
</P>
<P>
Almost 1,600 firefighters were fighting the blaze, aided by 16
helicopters and 58 fire engines.
</P>
<P>
An army battalion from Ft. Campbell, Ky., was also expected to
reinforce Montana firefighters later this week, followed a few
days later by another contingent from Fort Bragg, N.C.
</P>
<P>
They will join about 2,900 U.S. military, National Guard and
Reserve troops already aiding the some 20,000 weary firefighters
working to contain the blazes.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters from Canada, Mexico and as far away as Australia
and New Zealand are also battling the fires expected to burn
through at least September.

<HEADLINE> Thai Gov't to Set up Funds to Relieve Oil Price Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent oil-price hikes have hit these two sectors hardest,
government spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to ensure state-owned transport and
bus companies keeping fares at current levels.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has instructed the State Railways of Thailand to
keep its third-class fares at their current level. The Bangkok
Mass Transit Authority and the Transport Corporation were also
asked to maintain their current fares.
</P>
<P>
The Express Transportation Organization of Thailand, another
state-owned enterprise managed by the transport and communications
ministry, was also told not to increase fares.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has been instructed to establish a special fund to
help ease the woes of private transport businesses.
</P>
<P>
But private operators of inter-provincial buses will be allowed
to increase their fares to accommodate increased costs.
</P>
<P>
The government also proposed the taxis be converted to run on
natural gas, promising to finance taxi modifications, including
installation of a gas tank in each vehicle.
</P>
<P>
However, the government ruled out tax measures as a means of
easing fuel costs, saying that reducing oil taxes might undermine
the its monetary austerity policy and encourage increased petrol
consumption, which will adversely affect the economy in the long
run.

Indonesia has reached 37 million, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The existing program for jobless eradication was inadequate,
Coordinating Minister for Social Welfare and Poverty Eradication
Basri Hasanuddin was quoted Wednesday by the Jakarta Post daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The program has not worked due to lack of coordination,"
Hasanuddin said here at a seminar, adding that last year's
unemployment figure stood at 36 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Director General of Manpower Placement and
Development Tjepy F. Aloewie said that several ministries have
already had good programs.
</P>
<P>
"The target is to implement the programs together with good
coordination, especially in the regions. The programs have to
absorb a lot of workers," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hasanuddin also said Tuesday at an ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian nations) meeting on poverty eradication held here
Tuesday, that the poverty in Southeast Asia needs a greater
attention and must be uprooted soon.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that "there must be a joint network on this(
poverty eradication) among ASEAN countries because the ASEAN must
work together to improve the people's welfare."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Home to 4,500 Elephants: Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's elephant population
ranges from 4,000 to 4,500, some 1,500 more than earlier estimate,
according to the latest census taken by the Department of Wildlife
Conservation.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of Wildlife Conservation Nandana Attapattu was
quoted by the official Daily News as saying on Wednesday that an
earlier survey, which was not conducted on a proper basis, had
inaccurately estimated the elephant population at between 2,500
and 3,000.
</P>
<P>
He said that elephants were being killed in large numbers due
to human encroachment, poaching and the destruction of their
habitat because of the civil war in which rebels are fighting for
a homeland for the minority Tamils in the country's north and east
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
In 1970-1980 about 50 elephants were shot or captured annually.
Later in 1980-1990 about 50 more were shot dead by farmers yearly
to protect their crops. At present it is estimated that there are
about 150 elephant deaths per year.
</P>
<P>
In 1948 when Sri Lanka gained independence, there were more
than 20,000 elephants in the country which are viewed as national
treasures protected under law.
</P>
<P>
According to the census, there are about 226 domestic elephants
in the country which had been reduced due to the lack of breeding
facilities. Between 1946 and 2000 domestic elephant births were
only seven in addition to the 17 births recorded at the Pinnawela
Elephant Orphanage under captive breeding.

<HEADLINE> 1,000-year-old Vinegar Town Even Prosperous Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people love drinking tea
just like western people have special interest in coffee.
</P>
<P>
However, people in Langzhong, a 1,000-year-old small town in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, enjoy a quite different habit:
drinking vinegar instead of tea.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, local people cannot go by without vinegar
in their daily life: using vinegar as a kind of soft drinks to
replace tea, using vinegar to entertain guests instead of alcohol
and tea, and even pour vinegar in cooked rice as a tonic or health-
care medicine to prevent the complication of certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
Located at the foot of the Daba Mountain and by the River of
Jialing, a tributary of the Yangtze River, Langzhong is home to
Baoning Vinegar, one of the four name brand vinegar products in
China.
</P>
<P>
China mainly produces three kinds of vinegar products. They
include the mature vinegar, which is brewed from sorghum at high
temperature, with Chencu (mature vinegar) of north China's Shanxi
province as the sample, the aromatic vinegar, brewed from
glutinous rice at low temperature, with Zhenjiang Aromatic Vinegar
as a sample, and the bran vinegar, brewed from wheat bran at
modest temperature, with Baoning Vinegar as a typical example.
</P>
<P>
The history of Baoning Vinegar dates back some 300 years ago.
Baoning was the name of the county at that time. The well-
preserved "Vinegar Shop Street" in Langzhong still reminds people
of the prosperous scene of that time.
</P>
<P>
Langzhong now has more than 30 vinegar plants. Among them,
Sichuan Baoning Vinegar Co., Ltd is the largest vinegar producer
in southwest China, with an annual production capacity of 15,000
tons of table vinegar.
</P>
<P>
Baoning Vinegar has a stable market especially in southwest
China. One of the reasons why Baoning Vinegar enjoys popular fame
is that the Vinegar is said to be effective in preventing cancer
and many other diseases. The Sichuan Baoning Vinegar Co., Ltd, for
example, has found no cancer case for more than 50 years. Experts
said that this has something to do with the yeast for making the
Baoning Vinegar.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many new products have been developed from the
Baoning Vinegar, such as the acetic acid drinks, varied fruit
vinegar and special vinegar for drunken people.

<HEADLINE> Clash Kills Three in Irian Jaya, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Three civilians have been killed
and nine others injured during a clash between police and
separatists in Irian Jaya province, Indonesia, the Jakarta Post
daily reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The clash broke out at about 8:30 local time on Tuesday, after
some 500 supporters of the Free Papua Organization (OPM) hoisted
the separatist flag outside a church in the coastal oil town of
Sorong.
</P>
<P>
Official sources were quoted as saying that 38 civilians have
been detained following the incident.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Irian Jaya Police Chief Senior Superintendent Thamrin
Simandjuntak said five policemen were badly injured after being
stabbed with machetes, arrows and spears by separatists.
</P>
<P>
He said the policemen were met by a spray of arrows and spears,
and they retaliated by opening fire with rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
Irian Jaya was incorporated into Indonesia in 1963, after heavy
diplomatic pressure on the Netherlands, the country's former
colonial ruler. In 1969, a U.N.-run plebiscite was held among
local leaders, which resulted in a vote to join Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The violence in Sorong came a day after separatist leaders
threatened to wage an all-out war against Jakarta if their calls
for independence remained unheeded.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid told
the People's Consultative Assembly that Irian Jaya would be
accorded broad autonomy before the end of the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson was fined 125,000
pounds (185,700 U.S. dollars) by the British Boxing Board of
Control on Tuesday because of breach of the rules and "
reprehensible" comments against his opponent.
</P>
<P>
The American boxer fought after the bell following his victory
over countryfellow Lou Savarese in Glasgow in June, and made harsh
words about Britain's world heavyweight champion Lonnox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
Just 38 seconds after the bout started, Tyson knocked down
Savarese and punched referee John Coyle to the canvas after the
bout was stopped.
</P>
<P>
"I want to rip your heart out. I want to eat your children,"
Tyson said after the fight.

" I'm ready to help others, but people often think I'm a fool,"
said a listener to the "Accompany You Until Daybreak" radio
program.
</P>
<P>
Another listener said, "I fell in love with a married man, but
I don't want to listen to platitudes. If you were my older brother,
what advice would you give me?"
</P>
<P>
"I like my job in foreign enterprise, but I was troubled when
my boss tried to make sexual advances toward me at the office..."
</P>
<P>
In most cases, the hosts are patient and polite, but they can
also be tough.
</P>
<P>
A young man who used to live overseas telephoned Ye Sha, a
female host of the program, pouring out his broken heart as he
told of his numerous girlfriends who all dumped him in the end.
</P>
<P>
Ye told him bluntly, "What does love mean to you? You cannot go
blindly into a relationship without being a responsible person."
</P>
<P>
Shi Meijun, a department director at Shanghai Oriental
Broadcasting Station, said many people feel empty about life in
general, and this is quite common in a large bustling metropolis
like Shanghai which has a population of 13 million.
</P>
<P>
Communication between people is crucial, said Geng Wenxiu, a
psychology professor at East China Normal University, and a former
host of the program.
</P>
<P>
"The program is a mirror reflecting society," Ye said. "Several
years ago, those who called us were young couples living in
separate places who cannot stay together or migrant workers. What
made them miserable was that they could not stay with their
spouses."
</P>
<P>
"Today, there are problems such as extramarital affairs, young
lovers living together and wealthy men taking on a mistress," she
said. "We talk to our listeners and also offer them practical and
realistic advice."

<HEADLINE> Farming-Pasturing Area Faces Rapid Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Experts have asked for
ecological improvement efforts in this area of China where farming
and the raising of livestock take place.
</P>
<P>
Overgrazing has resulted in desertification to a certain degree
of about 80 percent of the 574,700 - square kilometer of pasture
in the co-developing area. The same thing is happening on the 519,
000 square kilometers of farmland, 45 percent of the belt has been
covered with sand.
</P>
<P>
The co-developing area, a joining belt of farming and pasture
industries, runs through 12 provinces and autonomous regions from
northeast to southwest. With some 1.1 million square kilometers,
the belt is facing the worst vegetation damage in the country.
</P>
<P>
Horqin Desert, Muus Desert, Tengger Desert and Badain Jaran
Desert are still spreading by several thousand hectares each year.
</P>
<P>
Han Jianguo, an expert in research of pasture ecology at China
Agricultural University, said the belt, where many rivers' sources
or upper reaches are located, plays a crucial role in sustaining
crop yields and building up a barrier from sand and heavy winds
for the lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
To curb the ecological problems, experts suggest the raising of
livestock become the area's pillar industry, increasing its output
value to over 70 percent of the area's total. They also favor
rotating between farming and raising livestock in one-half or one-
third of the belt to improve farmland fertility and ecological
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Harsh farming conditions have resulted in low yields and poor
living conditions in the belt. Statistics show 61 counties in the
area's 75 banners (counties) are in poverty, with 16 listed among
the nation's poorest counties.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Citizens Bare Souls on Radio Programs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- In China's largest commercial
city Shanghai, a number of people cannot fall asleep at night
because of heavy work commitments and stress.
</P>
<P>
But they have an outlet with a talk show program called "
Accompanying You Until Daybreak" broadcast on the Shanghai
Oriental Broadcasting Station.
</P>
<P>
Listeners can call in to talk with the show's hosts and can, if
they wish, bare their souls to the whole city. Many people have
regained their once shattered confidence by tuning into or being
an active participant on the program.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Wu Jindi, a mother of two children, lost her
factory job and worse still broke up with her husband. At that
time, she only had 20 yuan (about 2.4 U.S. dollars) in her pocket.
</P>
<P>
Wu, in her forties, even wanted to kill herself before she
called Yu Chen, one of program's hosts. Yu listened, consoled her
like a good friend, and asked listeners to help Wu.
</P>
<P>
Yu did not expect that the program would be so well received. "
An elderly lady was waiting for me outside the broadcasting
station at 5:00 am with 1,000 yuan for Wu when I had just finished
the program," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the help from people from all walks of life, Wu opened a
social service center employing 10 jobless women. In 1998, Wu's
situation became much better and she remarried.
</P>
<P>
Many Shanghai residents wait eagerly each night to tune into
the program, which was launched in 1992. So far, more than 20
people have worked as a host for the program.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai also has other talk show radio programs, on which
lawyers help citizens buy houses and provide legal consultancy
services, flea market owners tell people what's on their shelf.
Listeners can also find out how to solve problems which arise from
traffic accidents, and learn what to do in a dispute with a
shopping center.
</P>
<P>
Yu is a lawyer by profession and his job as a radio host is
just part-time.
</P>
<P>
He said he likes radio as a medium because he can reach out to
a multitude of people. "In today's modern society, people need
more heart-to-heart communication," Yu said.

<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China officially launched its
first website for the machinery industry in a bid to speed up the
traditional sector's development, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The website, e10000.com.cn, operated by the China Machinery-
Electricity Yiwan E-commerce and Network Co Ltd, provides a
business-to-business(B2B) platform for the machinery sector.
</P>
<P>
"The website will be built into the best and safest B2B portal
suitable for the unique characteristics of the machinery industry,
" said Mao Xin, deputy director of the Economic Information Center
under the State Administration of Machinery Industry.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited Mao as saying that the website would provide
firms with on-line trading and consultation services.
</P>
<P>
The e-commerce services will be extended to the whole country
following trials among electrical firms in North China and South
China.
</P>
<P>
As a major effort to combine Internet technology and
traditional business methods, chain stores specializing in
machinery and electrical products will also be set up nationwide
to complement the on-line business.
</P>
<P>
Customers will be able to place on-line orders, which will be
processed as quickly as possible allowing products to be delivered
in the shortest time, Mao said.

<HEADLINE> New Circuit to Better Link Beijing and Wuhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China will import equipment
worth 140 million yuan from Japan's NEC (Nippon Electric Corp) to
build a new micro-wave telecommunications circuit linking Beijing
and Wuhan, capital of Central China's Hubei Province, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The contract of the project was signed yesterday in Beijing.
National Power Telecommunications Center, a subsidiary of the
State Power Corp of China, is the operator of the project.
</P>
<P>
After public bidding last year, the center chose NEC from seven
competitors because of its advanced technology and low price, the
paper cited director of the center Cao Youzhi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-kilometer Beijing-Wuhan SDH (synchronized digital
hierarchy) microwave circuit will go into trial operations by July
2001. With 34 microwave stations, the circuit is capable of
handling 310 megabits per second.
</P>
<P>
The new system will replace the current Beijing-Wuhan digital
microwave circuit built 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The new SDH circuit will better cater to telecommunications
demand related to the coming power transmission from the Three
Gorges Hydropower Station, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Wuhan SDH circuit is part of an ongoing plan
launched by the State Power Corp of China to advance its national
electric telecommunications system.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's External Debt Rockets in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's external debt exceeded
34.4 billion U.S. dollars in June, equivalent to 40 percent of the
country's gross domestic product GDP), the Central Bank of the
Republic said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the quick rise of Colombia's foreign debt
to the tax crisis that obliged the government to seek funds on the
more costly outside market.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that when a country's international debts amount
to over 25 percent of its GDP, it has crossed the indebtedness
threshold, so Colombia's situation is alarming.
</P>
<P>
Debt servicing went up to 6.696 billion dollars in 1999,
accounting for 60 percent of Colombia's export earnings of that
year.
</P>
<P>
While Colombia is facing political and economic instability,
banks have considered investing in Colombia as highly risky.

BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bohai Sea Cleaning Plan,
launched by the central government recently, signifying China's
efforts to improve the environment, has extended from land to sea.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the Chinese government is to spend about
60 billion yuan (about 7.2 billion U.S.dollars) within 15 years to
deal with the pollution in Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
Experts disclosed economic losses due to pollution accounts for
four to 8 percent of the country's gross national product (GNP)
every year. The flooding in 1998 alone left over 200 million
people homeless, cost the lives of over 3,000 people and resulted
in over 160 billion yuan in direct economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Pollution dampens the country's efforts for sustainable
economic development and threatens national security. China's
central government's working report in 1999 first introduced "
clean industry inspiration" into official documents, requiring all
the contaminating enterprises to make reforms or they would be
closed.
</P>
<P>
Frank E. Loy, under-secretary for Global Affairs for the United
States once said if China does not tackle ecological problems now,
it will probably take the place of the United States in two or
three decades to become the country to discharge the largest
amount of greenhouse gases in the world.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, the capital city, listed among the world's 10 most
serious polluted cities, will invest 3 percent of its gross
domestic product this year in piping natural gas from northwest
China's Shaanxi Province, which will reduce auto exhaust emissions.
600,000 autos in Beijing have not been allowed to be on the roads
for too much exhaust emission.

<P>
Harbin, an old heavy industrial city in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, decided to allocate 30 billion yuan (about
3.6 billion U.S. dollars) over three years, to eliminate all
industrial pollution sources, substituting coal with natural gas
as the main source of energy and planting more trees, developing
the city into one of the cleanest ones.
</P>
<P>
Besides, southwestern Yunnan Province, east China's Anhui,
Jiangsu and Shandong provinces are all striving to improve their
environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
China is ranked at the top in sulfur dioxide discharge in the
world, the second in carbon dioxide, and the third in acid rain.
Among the 10 cities with the most serious pollution, seven are in
China. Also, 700 Chinese cities are facing an increasing lack of
water.
</P>
<P>
To cope with global warming, the "United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change" in 1992, required only the
industrialized countries to lower the giving-off of greenhouse
gases, with carbon dioxide in particular.
</P>
<P>
China made its contribution by closing down over 60,000
polluting factories and lowering sulfur dioxide's proportion in
the air in 98 cities to the set standard.
</P>
<P>
Loy thought highly of China's efforts during his visit to the
country in July, saying ," I must say what China is doing (on
ecological improvement) leaves a deep impression on me."
</P>
<P>
Xia Qing, vice-president of China Environmental Science
Research Institute, said besides more investment, an overall
ecological improvement also depends on citizens' increasing
awareness of environmental protection, and more related laws and
regulations as a strong backup.
</P>
<P>
China has put in a total of 450 billion yuan in environmental
projects since 1996, accounting for 1 percent of the GNP. The
figure is expected to increase by a large margin in the next five
years.

LAGOS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings appealed to Morocco to rejoin the Organization of African
Unity (OAU), Ghana News Agency reported on Wednesday.

<P>
Rawlings made the appeal when he met with visiting Moroccan
Foreign Minister Mohamed Benaissa in the capital Accra.

<P>
During the meeting, Benaissa transfered a message from King
Mohamed of Morocco to Rawlings.

Rawlings said: "It is our genuine desire to see Morocco back to
the OAU. What caused Morocco to leave the continental body could
be resolved."

<HEADLINE> Consumer Goods Industry Attracts Foreign Investors in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The consumer goods industry in
Romania attracts more and more foreign investors, the official
Rompres news agency reported Wednesday by citing a study of an
international consultancy company.
</P>
<P>
According to the study by the Roland Berger and Partners
international consultancy company, the Romanian consumer goods
market amounts to about 7 billion U.S. dollars a year, with bakery
products holding 17 percent of the market; tobacco, 16 percent;
and milk products, 15 percent. Coffee and beer hold 10 percent of
the market each while soft drinks and wine hold 7 percent each.
</P>
<P>
The importance of the consumer goods market has determined the
upward trend of other domains too, especially in distribution and
transport. Many retail selling networks and supermarkets as well
as cash and carry networks appeared in quite a short time.
Companies such as Interbrands, First Romanian Distribution,
Overseas and Cosmos appeared.
</P>
<P>
The consumer goods industry has also influenced the advertising
industry, with the consumer goods producers spending over 300
million U.S. dollars on advertising, about three-quarters of the
total expenditures for advertising in the country. As a result,
the advertising sector has rapidly developed by 50 percent
annually.

WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Wednesday that he gave order to release 1.3 billion U.S.

BUCHAREST, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The beer market in Romania

<HEADLINE> U.S. Delivers Last Check for Canal Profits to Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Panama
Simon Ferro delivered Wednesday to Panamanian President Mireya
Moscoso the last check for Canal profits obtained during the U.S.
administration of the waterway.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador said that the check, issued by the U.S.
Treasury, is for 6,666,141 dollars and 39 cents and will be made
to the Panamanian National Treasury.
</P>
<P>
"This is the last of a series of payments of profits from the
United States to the Panamanian government and represents the
completion of an excellent working relationship between the United
States and Panama, based on the good will and cooperation at all
levels," said Ferro.
</P>
<P>
The check corresponds to the financial auditing made by the old
Panama Canal Commission (PCC) during the first quarter of this
fiscal year, which includes operations between October 1, 1999 to
September 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The PCC, an agency of the U.S. federal government, entered
history with the reversion of the Panama Canal, which occurred on
December 31, 1999, according to the Torrijos-Carter Treaties
signed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The delivery of the check was made during the planting of more
than 500 seedlings of native species in the east of the Culebra
Cut, the narrowest part of the Canal of Panama, by 300 children,
to continue commemorating the 86th anniversary of the waterway.
</P>
<P>
President Mireya Moscoso said it is very important for the
Panamanian government to support the projects of the Panama Canal
Authority, the entity that replaces the PCC to take charge of the
canal operation.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Caught by Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Most Somalis were drawn before
a TV or radio on Thursday as the country's presidential candidates
deliver speeches campaigning for the forthcoming elections to be
held on Sunday in Arta, Djibouti, where a peace conference has
been held to find a central government for the Somalis.
</P>
<P>
In the capital Mogadishu, streets were empty and many of the
business activities closed down while thousands of people either
watched TV or listened to the radio, both of which carried a live
coverage of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, loudspeakers have been mounted on top of the
trees as the campaign continued.
</P>
<P>
During the speeches, four out of the 29 candidates officially
withdrawn from their desire to continue running for the presidency
of Somalia, leaving room for the other 25 still contesting for the
post.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 25 candidates delivered a seven-minute speech
spelling out his way of governance in the future. All of them
promised to rescue the country out of the current political and
social turmoil and pave the way for economic development.
</P>
<P>
Among the most interesting candidates was a man who pledged
that he would dig 63 oil wells, build up over 40 large factories,
dig more than 300 water wells and make use of most of the rivers
and coastal lands for fishing and settling down Somalia's large
nomadic societies along the sea sides and river banks.
</P>
<P>
The man, named Ibrahim Hassan Jumaleh, is not a well known man
in Somalia's recent politics, but he made the Somalis laugh to the
deepest of their hearts.
</P>
<P>
"I would not work for the faction leaders if I could get
employment in any of those oil wells," said a delighted gunman who
held a small FM radio to his ear near Bakara market.
</P>
<P>
Many people have applauded for Abdiqasim Salad Hassan, Somalia'
s former interior minister, who made his speech a very much
contemporary and carefully written one. He pledged a full recovery
in economy by choosing the market-oriented policy, good
international relation and enhancement of education for Somali
children.
</P>
<P>
Hassan also vowed for democracy, saying the Islamic laws will
all the time remain the points of reference.
</P>
<P>
Somalia's former finance minister Mohamed Sheikh Osman and
faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed have also been among the figures
who have attracted some people.
</P>
<P>
Following the speeches on Thursday, the candidates will run for
the presidency in an election Friday. According to Speaker
Abdulahi Deerow Issack of the transitional parliament, each of the
parliamentarians will cast his/her vote in a secret ballot
beginning from 15:30 local time (1230GMT).
</P>
<P>
No matter how long the voting takes, the exercise will be non-
stop until the final decision is made and the president of Somalia
is announced for the first time after ten years of anarchy and
lawlessness, Issack said.

<HEADLINE> UNIDO to Offer 1 Million U.S. Dollars to Zimbabwe's Flower Growers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) has approved a facility with a
total value of 1 million U.S. dollars to assist Zimbabwe's flower
growers for pilot project using steam instead of chemicals to
eradicate insects in the soil, a Zimbabwean official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Export Flower Growers Association of
Zimbabwe Mary Dunphy told the Zimbabwe News Agency that the first
boiler for this four-year project will arrive in the country in
January next year and the 1 million U.S. dollars will cover the
cost of the boilers and the training of people who will be
involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
Instead of going on using chemicals, the growers now want to
adopt the use of steam as a soil fumigant ahead of the set
schedules to phase out the use of chemicals by the year 2015 as
stipulated in the Montreal Protocol.
</P>
<P>
She said the technology had been used in Colombia and had
proved a success if done together with good compositing techniques
and good management techniques.
</P>
<P>
A Colombian consultant was sent to Zimbabwe by UNIDO recently
and gave growers an insight into the production of cut flowers
using steam as a fumigant.
</P>
<P>
Floriculture has been a success in Zimbabwe, which earns the
country millions of dollars in foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
During the 1999/2000 season, the sector exported 20,200 tons of
flower which was a 20 percent increase from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The association which is comprised of more than 280 flower
growers has exported most of its flowers to the European Union and
the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for More International Support for Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Home Affairs Minister
Peter Machungwa Thursday appealed for more support from
international institutions to accommodate a large number of
refugees in the country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
the World Food Program (WFP) should increase food supplies to the
refugees in various camps in Zambia if law and order is to be
maintained in those camps, Machungwa said during a meeting with
visiting UNHCR regional director to Southern Africa Ilunga Ngandu.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa noted that due to inadequate food supplies riots have
been reported in some of the camps causing a serious security risk
to both the locals and the refugees, adding that as a result some
local chiefs have called on the government to remove the refugees
from their areas.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the minister deplored the discrepancies in the
treatment of African refugees in comparison with refugees in other
parts of the world and called for equal refugee treatment
regardless of color or creed.
</P>
<P>
Ilunga Ngandu echoed Machungwa's call, saying Zambia needs more
international support in its efforts to provide a safe-haven for
refugees fleeing armed conflict and persecution.
</P>
<P>
There are over 200,000 refugees in Zambia mainly from Angola,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Somalia and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Promulgate New Tobacco Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's new tough
tobacco legislation will be promulgated by October 1, spokesman
for the Health Department Patricia Lambert announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
She said the last minor corrections are being made to the
regulations that will accompany the law, which is expected to be
made public next week.
</P>
<P>
The Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act, approved by South
African Parliament in 1999, will ban tobacco advertising and
publicized sponsorships and prohibit smoking in public places,
including the workplace except as permitted by the South African
Health Minister.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will set out exactly where people may or may
not smoke and will set deadlines for ending advertising and
sponsorship.

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Chief Lobbys for Firearms Control Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Proposals in the Firearms
Control Bill would greatly enhance the effectiveness of crime-
fighting operations undertaken by the South African Police Service
(SAPS), national police Commissioner Jackie Selebi said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, they would significantly strengthen the
SAPS' ability to regulate and control both legally and illegally
possessed firearms, Selebi said.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the National Assembly's safety and security committee,
Selebi said provisions in the bill would result in fewer guns
finding their way out of legal hands and into illegal ones.
</P>
<P>
The draft legislation made a clear distinction between what was
legal and what was not, gave the police improved powers of search
and seizure and paved the way for more effective policing.
</P>
<P>
Rigorously implemented and appropriately supported by other
mechanisms, the bill represented a major tool, essential in the
fight against violent crime, the police chief said.
</P>
<P>
The police saw the reduction and ultimate eradication of
illegal firearms as a priority, he said.
</P>
<P>
Selebi and various members of his senior management team
rejected allegations by some organizations that the bill would
prove impossible to implement and cost too much.
</P>
<P>
"In response to repeated concerns regarding implementation and
resources, it is important to note that we have, wherever possible,
addressed requirements in the bill in a flexible way so that there
is a less expensive or taxing alternative to the ideal," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africans suffered the effects of widespread crime and
rejection of the law every day.

<HEADLINE> Iranian, Zimbabwean Foreign Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian Foreign Affairs
Minister Kamal Kharrazi held talks on Thursday with his Zimbabwean
counterpart Stan Mudenge on bilateral cooperation in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
The two sides looked at how arrangements could be made for Iran
to supply Zimbabwe with petroleum and other fuel related products,
Kharrazi said after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
This issue, he said, would be pursued and discussed in detail
at higher level meetings since the two countries had given each
other assistance and advise on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Iran was willing to help Zimbabwe's private and public sectors
develop projects, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed his country was against intervention of internal
affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the controversial Zimbabwe Democracy Act 20000,
Kharrazi said that the United States was seeking to pass the bill
as a weapon to impose economic sanctions on Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The bill was introduced by the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations last month in response to the pre- and post-election
violence in June and the invasion of white-owned commercial farms
by war veterans in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a delegation of the Southern African
Development Community was expected to leave for the U.S. next
month to campaign against the Act.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Confident of Signing Burundi Peace Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president Nelson Mandela said on Thursday he did not have the
slightest doubt that all parties involved in Burundi's seven-year
civil war would sign a peace deal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in his Johannesburg office, Mandela said
the parties were committed to peace and "they have not
disappointed me so far".
</P>
<P>
Mandela, chief mediator for Burundi peace talks, will travel to
the Tanzanian town of Arusha on Saturday for Monday's signing
ceremony which will also be witnessed by U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The run-up to the signing has been marked by an increase in
hostilities in Burundi and growing opposition to the draft text of
the deal.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela said he was confident that the peace deal
would be signed as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question whatsoever," he said. "The overwhelming
majority of parties and I believe every party is going to sign."
</P>
<P>
On whether the parties were genuinely committed to peace,
Mandela said: "We are dealing with a highly complicated political
issue. There are 19 political parties and they differ on almost
every point . But nevertheless we have persuaded them to agree to
the unanimous resolution in which they committed themselves to
signing."

<HEADLINE> Angola's Economic Growth Registers at 6.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Angola has seen an average
economic growth rate of 6.5 percent during the last five years, an
official of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was quoted as
saying here on Thursday by the official news agency Angop.
</P>
<P>
Jose Pedro de Morais, who made the statement in Luanda when
addressing a seminar on the role of planning and integrated
management for developing the Angolan economy, said that evolution
of the gross domestic product (GDP) was largely determined by the
consequences of the war which erupted in late 1992. In 1996, four
years after the recrudescence of the Angolan civil war, the GDP
went back to the level of the prewar 1992, estimated at eight
billion U.S.dollars.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the recovery was insufficient to restore the
loss of incomes by the population during the 10 years previous to
1995. In the last five years, the public expenditures
systematically exceeded the revenues, showing a fiscal deficit of
between 29 and 13 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
This implies needs for very significant funding into the public
sector, said the IMF official. Pedro de Morais noted that the
Angolan National Bank (BNA) has been making an enormous effort to
try to stabilize the monetary aggregates and the inflation, adding
that if everything goes on well, a supplementary drop in inflation
of up to two digits is expected next year, after reforms were
successfully introduced into the monetary market plus the
liberalization of the interest rates.

<HEADLINE> S. African Scholar Urges to Reform AIDS Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- HIV/AIDS education in South
Africa can not hope to succeed if it is taught as a separate area
of study, Director of the Center for the Study of AIDS at the
University of Pretoria Mary Crewe said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"What we need is to challenge our existing curricula and
integrate it (AIDS education) through all the subjects we are
teaching," she said at the African Convention of Principals here.
</P>
<P>
Crewe pointed out that South Africa has been identified as
having the fastest-growing epidemic in the world with one in 10
adults between the ages of 15 and 49 already living with the HIV
virus.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the infection rate of South Africa's
teachers is well over 10 percent and nearly 25 percent of the
country's children live in homes or communities where HIV/AIDS are
already prevalent.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that AIDS will have dramatic unimaginable
repercussions on education and the education system in South
Africa," the scholar noted.
</P>
<P>
She further emphasized that teachers also need to be trained in
how to cope with death and dying in their training program, which
should be offered by schools as a crucial part of in-service
training, and applicants for teaching positions who are not AIDS
literate should not be considered for appointment.

<HEADLINE> Drought Hits Blow to Kenya's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new forecast is contained in a memorandum by the Treasury
to a visiting International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission which
arrived here on Wednesday to assess the impact of drought on this
year's budget.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product growth forecast by the government
assumes that the short rains would fall in October and November as
expected and the ongoing power rationing would ease before the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The forecast also assumes that the country would receive
sufficient long rains as expected from March to May next year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the prolonged drought, maize production in the country
is expected to drop by between 30 to 40 percent this year. As a
result, the Kenyan government has to import 10 million bags (90-kg
per bag) of maize and 1.8 million bags of wheat this year.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury has also projected that it will spend 29 billion
shillings (around 381 million U.S. dollars) in the drought related
matters this financial year, noting that with 16 billion shillings
(around 210 million dollars) pledge by donors this year, the
government has estimated the drought would create a deficit of 20.
3 billion shillings (about 267 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Russia Cooperate in Combating Drug Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Russia have
agreed to enhance cooperation in combating transnational drug-
related crimes, Tanzanian local press reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made during a meeting here Wednesday between
Tanzanian Minister for Home Affairs Mohamed Seif Khatib and the
visiting Russian Head of Committee for Combating Transnational
Crime General Ancetoly Koulikov.
</P>
<P>
They discussed measures by the two countries to collaborate in
combating illicit drug crimes and in other areas. Khatib asked the
Russian delegation to consider the possibility of helping Tanzania
to establish centers for treating drug addicts because currently
Tanzanian drug addicts are taken to general hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Koulikov said that his country is ready to further train the
Tanzanian law enforcers in the Russian specialized police unit on
combating illicit drug trade and other cross-border crimes and
enhance information and experience exchange.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania warns that East African region has become a major
illicit drug conduit connecting America, Europe and other areas in
the world due to the introduction of better means of communication
since the late 1980's.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian police have arrested 1,897 suspects dealing with
drugs between 1990 and 1999. Meanwhile, Tanzania has incorporated
education on drug abuse in training manuals in primary and
secondary schools as part of the government strategy to combat the
vice.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Develop Animal Husbandry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda, an east African country,
needs to double its efforts to develop animal husbandry in a bit
to raise the per capita beef consumption level of its people,
according to a study report.
</P>
<P>
An average Ugandan eats only six kilograms of beef annually,
compared with the required United Nations standard of 50 kilograms,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision newspaper reported on Thursday that the study
report, entitled "Strengthening the Uganda Beef Producers'
Association", was carried out by Swede-Agri of Sweden and funded
by Swedish International Development Agency at a cost of over 184,
000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that only 20 percent of the grasslands was
used for cattle rearing and called for a complete rejuvenation.
The report also recommended that a new abattoir of 20 million U.S.
dollars should be set up.
</P>
<P>
Marketing, investments, breeding and disease control education
and training should be put in place in the next 10 years, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The report has been handed over to Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni as well as Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industry and
Fisheries Kisamba Mugerwa.
</P>
<P>
The minister asked the government to support the sector
technically and political if it is to survive, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Large Amount of Cocaine Seized in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Angolan National Police announced
here on Thursday that some 62 kilograms of cocaine had been seized
in Luanda since January, the biggest quantity of drugs ever seized
during such a short period in Angola.
</P>
<P>
In the last two months alone, 35 kilograms of cocaine were
captured at the Luanda International Airport, said an official
declaration issued on Thursday by the Angola National Police.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, on August 16, a citizen from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, resident in Luanda, was arrested
at the Luanda international airport when the police found that
there were 39 packets of cocaine in his bags.
</P>
<P>
Another 17 kilograms of cocaine from Brazil were held in June
this year at the Luanda International Airport. The police
authorities have admitted that there might be a gang of
traffickers based in South Africa and Brazil, with Angola as a
transit point, saying that much of the drug held in Angola comes
from Latin America, mainly from Brazil.

ROME, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli assurances on the efforts
being made to speed a settlement with the Palestinians were
central in a lengthy telephone conversation Wednesday between
Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben Ami and Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini, Italian foreign ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ami, who is the diplomatic chief on an ad interim basis
while still holding his portfolio for internal security, briefed
Dini on the Israeli position as negotiators seek to forge on after
the failure of the Camp David summit in July.
</P>
<P>
In one sign of movement, Bassan Abo Sharif, Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat's special adviser, said at the Italian
Adriatic resort of Rimini Tuesday that the September 13 deadline
for declaring a Palestinian state "is not sacred."
</P>
<P>
"We can change it," he said at the Friendship Meeting,
confirming statements from other leading Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the EU to call a conference with the U.S., Israel,
Palestine and the Arab countries to check out the chances of peace.
</P>
<P>
But according to many observers, the next probable key date for
the negotiations will be the U.N. Millennium Summit in New York
early next month, when U.S. President Bill Clinton is expected to
hold talks with Arafat, on September 6, and Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Fruitful talks could be the prelude to a new three-way summit,
they said, while sterility in the exchanges could plunge the peace
process still deeper into crisis.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Culture Tour to Be Launched in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 23 (Xinhua) -- An eight-minute video tape
showing Chinese costumes of different dynasties and different
ethnic groups, and Chinese modern culture was displayed here at
Lincoln Center Wednesday on the eve of a 25-day Chinese cultural
promotion festival.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Culture Promotion Festival, at the joint
sponsorship of the Information Office of Chinese State Council and
the Chinese Ministry of Culture, is to start from Thursday in the
New York City.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected to help the American people get to know more
about China and its people," said Zhao Qizheng, director of the
Information Office.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Chinese and American media at a press
conference held in Lincoln Center, Zhao said cultural exchanges
are an important way of better knowing each other for both
Americans and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
From August 24 to September 17, exhibitions, artistic
performances and speeches will be held and given in New York,
Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles and other American cities to
introduce China's traditional culture, modern art, and the history
of and current situation in China.
</P>
<P>
"America has a short history but is the most advanced country
in the world, while China, as the largest developing country, is
not known well to the outside world although it boasts of long-
lived history and splendid culture."
</P>
<P>
"So I hope that Americans can better know China through this
culture tour," said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
It is the second such kind of cultural show after China Culture
Week was successfully held in Paris, France last year. But this
year's event is even bigger, said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan have all sent
letters of congratulations on the occasion of the festival.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese and Americans are two great nations. Both have
made outstanding contribution to the advancement of world
civilization." Jiang wrote, "It is my hope that this program will
play a positive role in promoting cultural exchanges between China
and the United States, and between East and West."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Clinton said "the United States and China, each
with a rich cultural heritage, have much to gain from such
exchanges," and he believed that "the arts are a universal
language of expression for virtually every society."
</P>
<P>
The first event of the Chinese culture tour will be a concert
of Chinese folk music given by China's Central Nationalities
Orchestra at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York on
August 24 evening.
</P>
<P>
"Anywhere in the world, music can be a form of perfect
communication," said Annan in a letter of greetings to the concert.

NEW YORK, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose
Wednesday as investors continued to show optimism about the
Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates alone Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 5.50 at 11,144.65,
extending its gain of 59.34 points in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 52.80 at 4,011.01 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 7.84 at 1,505.97.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell as much as 79 points earlier in the session
apparently on profit-taking but the blue chip index bounced back
to the positive territory at the finish.
</P>
<P>
The index gained 59.34 points Tuesday and 33.33 points Monday
in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's decision on steady rates.
After a crucial meeting on the rate issue Tuesday, the central
bank announced its decision to stay on hold amid signs that the U.
S. economy is cooling and inflation remains tame.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed the Federal Reserve will leave rates
unchanged at least until the American voters go to polls in
November in the presidential election year.
