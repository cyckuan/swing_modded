KOBE, SHAQ NAMED TO ALL-NBA TEAMS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ An achy foot, a painful performance and an
All-NBA nod combined to make an interesting 24 hours for Kobe
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd bit of timing, Bryant was named to the All-NBA second
team Wednesday, just a day after his six turnovers and shaky
shooting contributed to the Lakers' Game 5 loss to the Portland
Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored,'' Bryant said. ``Being third-team last year and
moving up to second team, it's a serious honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal was a unanimous selection (Fred Hickman
presumably included) as the NBA's top center, marking his second
election to the first team.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant earned 45 first-team votes but was only the
fourth-highest guard in the balloting, behind first-teamers Gary
Payton and Jason Kidd and second-teamer Allen Iverson. Bryant said
he's not disappointed, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be on the second team,'' he said. ``It gives me
something to work for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he has plenty to work on before the conference
finals resume Friday. Early foul trouble and some reckless play
made Game 5 one of his worst performances of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a lot of turnovers, mistakes, bad decisions,'' he
said. ``I mean, it's something that we all did. But no biggie, just
forget it. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of have to give them different looks, as far as my
positioning on the court. Kind of mix it up. ... I just kind of
have to play different positions within the triangle (offense),
kind of throw them off guard a little bit, throw the defense off
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who coach Phil Jackson called ``a lot out of control''
in Game 5, admitted he was too eager to try to take over the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' he said. ``Just relax, let the game come to
you. It's tough, man, because especially when you try to do that,
then you get in foul trouble situations and you can't find your
rhythm. It can be tough sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's sprained right foot, suffered in the first quarter
Tuesday, forced Jackson to limit his activity Wednesday, but he's
expected to be fine for Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't stop and cut, I couldn't really plant off my right
foot, but it will heal with time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MISFIRING: Jackson had varied explanations for the Lakers' 38
percent shooting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it was was settling for shots, some of it was
confusion, and we have to give Portland some credit for being very
active on the defensive end. As a consequence, we didn't stay
aggressive on the offensive end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Portland's double-teaming of O'Neal and Bryant has opened spaces
for other Lakers, but only Ron Harper (14 points) took advantage
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the players have not stepped into that vacuum,''
Jackson said. ``Robert (Horry) has not made but one outside shot in
the last 12 quarters, and he's a better shooter than that. He's got
to shoot. I challenged these guys today about their shooting, and
we spent a lot of time just getting the rhythm back in our
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The starkest dropoff came from Glen Rice, who scored a
postseason-high 21 points Sunday, then a playoffs-low 4 points
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it has to do with Portland's defense,'' Rice
said. ``They didn't allow us to get into our offense easy like we
were able to the game before. ... If we can go out there and
execute the way we know how, set screens and move bodies, things
will come a little easier for us.''
</P>
<P>
   CHEAPER THAN AIR FARE: Staples Center will carry Friday's game
at Portland live on its scoreboard screens and TV monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Free tickets will be distributed today at 10 a.m. at the Staples
Center box office and TicketMaster outlets. No tickets will be
distributed via the TicketMaster phone center or online. &QL;

L.A. NEEDS THERAPY TO LOVE LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Doc, Los Angeles here. Can we talk?
</P>
<P>
   It's about the Lakers. I thought we had turned a corner in our
relationship this past month. I was letting myself trust them and
it felt terrific.
</P>
<P>
   I trumpeted our relationship. I was loud and proud. I wore
Shaquille O'Neal's jersey; I was sure this was the year he was
going to give me a ring.
</P>
<P>
   I'd pull up next to Robert Horry at a stoplight and I'd gaze at
him with such pure anticipation he wanted to tape to his window a
cue card that read: ``Yes. We're going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd run into A.C. Green at the gas station and I wouldn't
pretend I didn't see him, as I was inclined to do earlier in the
year. I didn't bother acting all aloof so he couldn't see how much
I cared. I felt connected enough to him to make eye contact, to
make conversation.
</P>
<P>
   I'd say, ``You aren't going to let me down this year, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   A.C. would just smile. He didn't take my doubting personally. He
understood I was carrying around a decade of emotional baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Of course he did. He was around in the 1980s when I was so close
to the Lakers, it was hard to tell where Showtime ended and my
identity began.
</P>
<P>
   God, those were gratifying years. But it all started to change
after the Lakers suffered that setback to Phil Jackson's Chicago
Bulls in the 1991 Finals. The Lakers after that became cavalier.
They couldn't be trusted as far as Nick Van Exel could sneer.
</P>
<P>
   They were full of so many empty promises and false hope, I
learned not to expect too much so I wouldn't be let down.
</P>
<P>
   But old affections die hard. I let myself think the Lakers
finally were going to do right by me in 1998. I bought all their
sweet talk. They restored my confidence in them.
</P>
<P>
   I was naive enough to assume they had matured, that they were
sincere.
</P>
<P>
   So I couldn't help but feel betrayed when they succumbed to Utah
in the Western Conference finals without winning a game.
</P>
<P>
   They took my faith in them and twisted it until it looked
grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassment was all I felt last year when the Lakers lost to
San Antonio in the second round of the playoffs. I was mad at
myself for allowing them to hurt me again.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of fool did they take me for, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   I have Hollywood, I have the coastline, I have the mountains, I
have the Dodgers and the Kings and the Galaxy and the upcoming
Democratic National Convention, for goodness' sake.
</P>
<P>
   I was the first to wear sunglasses at night and lacy camisoles
in broad daylight. People everywhere feed off my style, my energy,
my imagination. I didn't need the Lakers to win to feel good about
myself.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I told myself, anyway. I vowed to remain emotionally
detached from them forevermore. If they wouldn't change, I was
going to have to.
</P>
<P>
   My resolve started to unravel last June when Jackson was named
the head coach. He had effectively ended the Lakers' dynasty in
1991 so why shouldn't he be the one to restore the franchise to its
previous glory?
</P>
<P>
   The regular season started and the wins stacked up and I felt
myself succumbing, slowly but surely, to the Lakers' debonair
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Their winning streaks of 16 and 19 games were intoxicating. I
became drunk on the possibilities. My judgment became impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Little signs that would have raised red flags for me before I
simply ignored, such was my euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   You'd have thought I would have sobered up in a hurry when
Sacramento extended the Lakers to five games in the first round of
the playoffs. That should have been a flashing neon sign that the
team was toying with my emotions again.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers couldn't put Phoenix away in four games in the
second round, it ought to have been painfully obvious I was being
set up for more disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   I so wanted to believe it was going to be different this time, I
turned a blind eye to the telltale signs I've come to know and
dread.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Lakers have lost two consecutive games at home to
Portland, they've squandered one of their triple-match points and
I'm feeling featherbrained for ever believing that investing all my
emotions in the Lakers could end any other way but badly.
</P>
<P>
   All I want is to get back those old feelings again. I want it to
be the way it was in 1980, in 1982, in 1985, in 1987, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me, Doc, is that so wrong? &QL;

IT SEEMS LAKERS NEED ADVERSITY TO PLAY WELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ So we've learned this much about the
Lakers: They can't play fat.
</P>
<P>
   Give them some sense of urgency, tighten the vise, make them
squirm and sweat ... and now you've got some basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't give them three games to eliminate their playoff
opponent 'cause they're just not going to get it done early.
</P>
<P>
   For these would-be Lords of the NBA, it's just so pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
   Call it overconfidence or lacking the killer instinct, say it's
being lazy or due to a a strange alignment of the stars, but the
Lakers have been at their best in the postseason when the situation
was most difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers could have wiped out the Trail Blazers in five quick
games on Tuesday night, but instead suffered a 96-88 eyesore that
leaves them having to win in Portland on Friday, or be forced into
an anything-can-happen seventh game at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they won what should have been their two toughest
games of the series in their two previous playoff games at
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Now, those were difficult if not unexpected. Those were right
down their we-never-do-it-the-easy-way alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely doesn't guarantee a win, but it seems so far in
these playoffs that until we feel uncomfortable, we don't really
perform the way that we should,'' Lakers guard Derek Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost seems instead of us having a natural sense of
urgency, we have to be put into a situation where we're forced to
have that feeling. And I think we're in that situation now.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be bad news for the Blazers. Winning three
consecutive playoff games at Portland, now there's a challenge that
should warm the Lakers' little competitive hearts.
</P>
<P>
   This should all sound familiar. The Lakers won their first two
playoff games in the opening round against the Kings, stumbled
around in Sacramento and had to go to a decisive fifth game to
advance. And they won that one 101-88.
</P>
<P>
   They had a chance to sweep the Suns in the second round, lost
and then won 87-65.
</P>
<P>
   They lost their home-court advantage with a Game 2 loss to the
Blazers at Staples Center, won consecutive games in Portland and
then flopped back at home.
</P>
<P>
   That's three consecutive times they could have closed out a
series early but stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing pains,'' said Lakers forward Rick Fox. ``We've had
knockout punches this year in the playoffs. We know how to deliver
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's just doing it when it needs to be done and not
messing around. In the case of a team as good as Portland is, you
give them life and they gain confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the Lakers grow weary of talk about their lack of killer
instinct. Yet until they demonstrate one, they're doomed to keep
hearing it like some unwanted mantra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can keep debating our killer instinct all the way to the
championship,'' said Lakers guard Kobe Bryant. ``We talk about
killer instinct every series, and we always seem to bounce back. We
just have to do the same thing this series.''
</P>
<P>
   To do it on Friday, they'll likely need a healthy Bryant, shoot
better than .380 percent from the field, take fewer than 27 3-point
attempts and rediscover their bench production.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant sprained his right foot Tuesday in the first half of a
miserable night for the shooting guard. He had treatment Wednesday
and is expected to be at full strength for Game 6 at Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Winning on the road has become the unexpected staple of the
Western Conference finals. The oddity of this series was the Lakers
actually winning the opener at home. The visiting team won each of
the next four. And the Lakers hadn't lost consecutive games at home
all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at times it's been a lack of respect on both sides
when it comes to defending their home court,'' said Fox. ``There's
no excuse for it. In the case of Portland, they knew they were
going to be eliminated and we knew had three games to eliminate
them, which is the wrong attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson _ never exactly shy to criticize the Lakers _
eschewed any theories that they had failed to show an ability to go
for the throat when the opportunity to close out Blazers presented
itself Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game didn't have anything to do with our lack of killer
instinct,'' Jackson said. ``It had a lot to do with Portland, it
had a lot to do with how the refereeing was done in the ballgame,
and how it put us on our heels and we didn't adjust in the process.
But I can't throw aspersions at our ballclub for this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are operating under the
what-doesn't-kill-us-makes-us-stronger theory. They're no good at
being Team Comfy, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Tuesday's loss, Jackson was already talking of
how the team might even be better off for having gone through a
difficult series like the one against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let you know,'' Bryant said, ``when it's over.'' &QL;

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The cruelty of Patrick Ewing's return to the New
York Knicks after the team pulled off two playoff victories without
him was punctuated with just under four minutes left in Game 5 of
the Eastern Conference finals Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With his aching body creaking like old floorboards, Ewing
lumbered out too slow and too late to reach Sam Perkins in the left
corner of the floor. The Indianapolis Pacers' old-timer had all
night to line up a 3-pointer that took the air out of the Knicks'
plans to right their miserable second quarter with a late comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins turned a six-point lead into a nine-point edge. That's
all the Pacers needed. Although Ewing was only a bit player in the
Knicks' 88-79 loss Wednesday night, he will surely receive a large
part of the criticism. The Knicks are just one game from
elimination after falling behind the Pacers 3-2. Game 6 will be
played on Friday at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ewing's dream return at first. He made his first three
shots and sent the Knicks off to an 18-point lead early in the
second quarter, only to watch the team unravel during a nightmarish
second quarter. The Knicks scored just eight points, went 1 for 15
during the last 10 minutes and 42 seconds of the quarter and
trailed 42-40 after the Pacers' 23-3 run.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard they tried to repair their spirits, there was
Jalen Rose (17 points), Reggie Miller (16 points) and Travis Best
(24 points) to snuff out their comeback hopes. Allan Houston (25
points) could not pull the Knicks along by himself. The heros from
Game 3 and 4, Latrell Sprewell (4 for 14, 10 points) and Larry
Johnson (6 points), could not shake off a furious defensive effort
by Rose and Dale Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was in no shape to help either. He seemed fit in the
opening quarter, but grew increasingly out of breath as the game
continued. He finished the game with 13 points and seven rebounds
and missed five of his last seven shots.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a week, Ewing watched his team win two playoff games
without him while listening to his critics argue how the Knicks
were better when he was seated on the bench. That was enough
motivation for Ewing Wednesday night. But if he needed one more
incentive to push him through the pain during Game 5, he received
it from Jeff Van Gundy Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A blissfully unaware Rik Smits ambled into a hallway Wednesday
only to find that an indignant Van Gundy had turned his honest
replies about playing against Ewing into a gauntlet for the Knicks'
aging and injured center. On Tuesday, Smits said he preferred to
play against Ewing because he felt the 37-year-old center was
easier to score on. Ewing played him from behind, while Chris
Dudley and Kurt Thomas fronted him and denied him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was Rik Smits, personally, I would not have said that,''
Van Gundy said before his team's shoot-around at Conseco
Fieldhouse. ``I've never heard anybody ask to play against Patrick.
This is a first for me. Not many guys ask to play against a Hall of
Famer at his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how Patrick will respond. I know one thing: he's
not usually motivated by external forces, but I've never seen
someone basically call him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing responded by humiliating Smits in the opening quarter, and
leading the Knicks to a 32-17 first-quarter lead. Then the Pacers,
with Smits on the bench and Travis Best guiding their way,
responded by embarrassing the Knicks right back. In one surreal
second quarter, the Pacers unleashed a frenzied rebounding effort,
pressured the Knicks into a four turnovers and made up an 18-point
deficit. With an overpowering 23-3 run, the Pacers grabbed an
amazing 42-40 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks scored just eight points in the quarter, shot only
12.5 percent and, after holding a 37-19 lead, finished the last
10:42 of the half by shooting an abysmal 1 for 15. Once the Knicks
guards were shut down on the perimeter by Miller, Rose and Best,
they turned to Ewing, but he missed 3 of 4 jumpers in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their shooting effort wasn't even the worst part of their
collapse. It was their rebounding. With Camby getting beaten to the
boards by players like Austin Croshere, Best and Derrick McKey, the
Knicks were outrebounded in the second quarter, 16-8. On one play,
Best hit a 3-pointer on a third chance after two misses by Miller.
The 3-point opportunities haunted the Knicks. They gave up 4 for 9
from 3-point range in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   To start the third quarter, the Knicks exited the locker room
determined but unable to put up a roadblock to the momentum the
Pacers had on their side. After Houston tied the game, 45-45, on a
3-pointer, the Pacers started to barge their way inside the lane
and drew fouls along the way. With 3:55 left in the third, the
Knicks were in the penalty and Mark Jackson was at the free-throw
line after Chris Childs committed a foul away from the ball.
Jackson hit both free throws to give the Pacers a 60-51 lead.
Jackson then posted up Childs and dumped the ball in a hook shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks did not let the game get too far away at this point.
They clamped down on defense with Childs on Miller, forced the
Pacers into a turnover and were down just 63-55 after two free
throws by Camby with three-tenths of a second left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had time to pull themselves together and reclaim the
edge they had when they began the night. There was such fire in the
Knicks at the start. While Smits missed baby hook shots and botched
jumpers, Ewing found his niche in the Knicks' uptempo system. He
wasn't the focus of the Knicks' offense, he was just the safety
net. Twice, he was in position for put-backs. Once, he was fouled
by Smits and converted on the 3-point play.
</P>
<P>
   As Ewing left the floor with 2:53 remaining in the first
quarter, he exited 3 for 3 with nine points and four rebounds.
Smits was 0 for 5.

LANGENBRUNNER OUT FOR GAME 2

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Stars list winger Jamie
Langenbrunner as day to day with a sprained right knee. His
gingerly skating in practice, though, makes a month-to-month
prognosis seem more likely.
</P>
<P>
   He's hardly putting any pressure on that leg, and forget digging
for pucks in corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better,'' Langenbrunner said. ``I mean it's definitely
getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner hasn't played since injuring his knee in Game 5 of
the Western Conference Finals against the Colorado Avalanche. Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said Langenbrunner won't play tonight in Game 2
of the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He skated \RTuesday\S, and he came up sore,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner said Hitchcock isn't just trying to throw off the
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be out there skating if I didn't think I could
return,'' Langenbrunner said. ``I don't know when, but I'm doing
the things I need to do to try to get back.'' Yuck Stars defenseman
Richard Matvichuk held nothing back in his assessment of why the
Stars lost Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't really focused. We weren't ready. For some odd
reason, we just weren't there,'' Matvichuk explained. ``Our jump
wasn't there. Our strong puck play wasn't there. Our defensive-end
coverage wasn't there. Our forecheck was horrible.'' Carbonneau a
finalist Stars center Guy Carbonneau is one of three finalists for
the 2000 William Masterton Memorial Trophy, given annually to the
player who ``exemplifies the qualities of perseverance,
sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   The other finalists are New Jersey defenseman Ken Daneyko and
New York Rangers winger Adam Graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a great honor. Any time you are mentioned for
a trophy, it means you did something,'' Carbonneau said. ``I am
sure my age had something to do with it. I've always said I enjoy
playing and I enjoy competition, and I think that's what writers
look for.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner, as selected by the Professional Hockey Writers
Association, will be announced June 15. \Nsubheds:Bouck signs
contract Right wing Tyler Bouck signed a three-year contract with
the Stars yesterday. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Bouck, 20, who was selected in the second round of the 1998
entry draft, had 30 goals and 33 goals last season for Prince
George in the Western Hockey League. Bouncing back Stars defenseman
Sergei Zubov had as bad a night as goalie Ed Belfour. Zubov, who
missed the first five games of the playoffs with an injured knee,
entered last night's game a plus-6. He left a plus-2.
</P>
<P>
   He was on the ice for the game's first six goals, five of which
were scored by the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zubov was the victim of trying to do too much once we got down
a little bit,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``But if there is
anybody who can shake it off, it is Zuby.'' Sixth sense Backup
goalie Manny Fernandez did not know that Ed Belfour was not feeling
well, but Fernandez suspected something was wrong after the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was showing signs that he doesn't show usually,'' said
Fernandez, who replaced Belfour with a little less than 17 minutes
remaining. ``I could tell there was something wrong. If it would
have been a regular-season game, they probably would have made me
play, but it's the playoffs, and he's going to battle through it.''
Road trip This is the first time since 1995 that the Stars haven't
had home-ice advantage. The Stars are 10-9 in road playoff games in
the 1999 and 2000 playoffs and have lost the first road game in
each of their four series this year. Counting on Guy Stars center
Guy Carbonneau, 40, quit counting a long time ago. Every time
someone tells him he has moved up the NHL's record book again, he
shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like statistics that much, so I'm not the guy that
looks at the things that I do,'' Carbonneau said. ``I wouldn't know
how many games or how many goals I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau has played in 226 playoff games, one behind
second-place Larry Robinson, now the Devils' coach, and 10 behind
Mark Messier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means I've been lucky to play for good teams,'' Carbonneau
said. ``I've always said that this is the best time of the year. To
be able to play that many games means that you've been successful
throughout your career.'' Quotable ``I find, myself, I'm bad for
the newspaper business. Because I don't buy newspapers when we get
drilled like that.'' _ Stars coach Ken Hitchcock Compiled by staff
writers Jennifer Floyd, Charean Williams and Mac Engel.

DEVILS CONTINUE TO SHOW DISCIPLINE IN PLAYOFF RUN
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Fluid skating. Pinpoint passing.
Precision shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Devils were given deserved credit for all of the
above after their 7-3 beating of the Stars in Game 1 of the Stanley
Cup Finals. After all, they did outskate and outshoot the Stars,
and limited their turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   What went slightly unnoticed _ but equally important _ was the
Devils' discipline, something that's been a strength throughout the
playoffs in spite of New Jersey's reputation for physical play. The
Devils were not penalized in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Devils coach Larry Robinson found that, in the face of Dallas'
physical play, to be extremely important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know our guys took a lot of whacks and high sticks and
elbows and everything last night, and I thought we kept our
composure very well,'' Robinson said. ``We are going to have to
continue doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's something New Jersey has done well throughout the
postseason. In 18 playoff games, the Devils have given the
opposition only 51 power plays. Dallas, by comparison, has been
short-handed on 90 occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got whacked pretty good at times, but took the punishment
and answered with goals,'' Devils winger Claude Lemieux said.
``That's the best way to answer.'' \Nsubheds:Role reversal Nobody
could stop talking about Scott Stevens' hit on Philadelphia's Eric
Lindros in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals, or about
Stevens' physical play in general.
</P>
<P>
   Well he showed them. Stevens, it seems, is more than just a
hitter. He can hit the net, too. In Game 1, Stevens had more goals
(one) than hits (zero), showing how versatile the Devils' captain
can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game is different,'' Stevens said. ``That game was more
positional. There wasn't a lot of hits either way. It was more of a
skating game and checking game.'' \Nsubheds:Scoring machines Martin
Brodeur has seen the offensive capabilities of the line of Jason
Arnott, Petr Sykora and Patrik Elias many times in practice. So
their four goals and seven assists in Game 1 _ even against a
goalie the caliber of Ed Belfour _ didn't completely surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love to score,'' Brodeur said. ``It is tough when you go
out every time and they just love to score and they brag about it
and they laugh about you when you can't stop them. It gets annoying
at times. That is why they are successful.'' \Nsubheds:Madden to
play Devils center John Madden reinjured a knee in Game 1 but said
there's no question about his status for Game 2: He's definite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brace moved on me and tweaked my leg a little bit, nothing
serious,'' Madden said. ``It will happen throughout the rest of the
season. I could have come back, but the score was 7-3 with about
three minutes left, so why chance it?''

COWBOYS HAVE TO CUT SANDERS BEFORE SATURDAY OR PAY UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Sometime in the next two days, Deion Sanders
will be released by the Cowboys, and he is expected to become the
league's most coveted free agent again.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, Tampa Bay and Denver already are expected to be the
leading bidders for the perennial All-Pro cornerback, who is
reportedly looking for a multiyear deal and a signing bonus of no
less than $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had to wait until today to make any move with
Sanders to lessen the impact on the 2000 salary cap. Fullback Daryl
Johnston, who is expected to retire because of a neck injury, is
expected to have his contract terminated for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have to cut Sanders before Saturday or his money for
the next two seasons _ a $10 million roster bonus and $500,000 in
base salary this season, and a $13 million salary next season _
will be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, 32, has anticipated becoming a free agent again since
the end of the 1999 season. Yet, as the deadline approaches, the
normally chatty Sanders wanted no part of the speculation that
surrounds his plans.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on ``where I'm going or what I'm going to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to talk about football,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, however, would say that he is healthy, has no regrets
or lasting disappointments about his failed baseball comeback or
his failure to join the Rangers, and is ready to be a full-time
football player again.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders says his injured knee, which required surgery after the
Cowboys' playoff loss to the Minnesota Vikings and hampered him
during his baseball stint with the Cincinnati Reds, is fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' Sanders said. ``My health is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who has missed 10 games because of injuries the past
four years, says he feels better than he has in several years and
credits nationally renowned speed coach Tom Shaw. Sanders has
worked exclusively with Shaw since being cut by the Reds about
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He also says he _ not the Reds _ ended his baseball comeback.
Despite his .200 batting average with the Triple-A Louisville
Riverbats, Sanders said the Reds were interested in his staying and
that other teams were interested in acquiring him.
</P>
<P>
   His wishes, however, were to play in the majors and play for the
Rangers. The Rangers, who were shopping for outfield depth and a
leadoff hitter, never made a serious bid for Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   He said the main reason he gave up on baseball was to spend more
time with his children before football season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't crushed that it didn't work out,'' Sanders said. ``I
accomplished what I wanted. I wanted to give it a shot and see if I
could make a comeback. I didn't want to wait until I was too old
and wonder what if. In the end, I did what was best for me and my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' decision also was best for his future in football. He
would have been hard-pressed to get the money he wants if he had
played a full season of baseball. Football teams will be more
inclined to pay Sanders at his market value knowing that he will be
in training camp and play a full season.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is probably the last place that Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones wants Sanders to end up. However, there's seemingly little
Jones can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was unavailable for comment yesterday. He is expected to
take the Cowboys coaches on a three-day trip to Las Vegas today.
</P>
<P>
   Even after being released, Sanders will count $2.2 million
against the Cowboys' salary cap in 2000. However, if they had cut
him before today, his contract would have counted $5.4 million
against the cap because of signing bonus money. Now, the Cowboys
can split that money up over two seasons, with $3.2 counting
against the cap in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting Sanders and Johnston will free up $1 million under the
cap by eliminating the $500,000 base salary of each. Johnston still
will get $466,700 in 2000 and 2001 because of bonus money.
</P>
<P>
   Jones hasn't totally ruled out the possibility of Sanders'
returning to Dallas. But that's only if Sanders doesn't get the
money he expects on the open market and decides he would rather
stay here for less money than go elsewhere for less money.
</P>
<P>
   Both scenarios are unlikely. Sanders, who has said in the past
that his career as a Cowboys player is over, declined to comment
yesterday on whether he had reconsidered playing for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins are considered the front-runners for Sanders'
services. Owner Daniel Snyder, who has already added a number of
prominent free agents to the roster, has said he will do whatever
it takes to get Sanders. Longtime standout cornerback Darrell Green
even has agreed to relinquish his starting job to Sanders without a
fuss.
</P>
<P>
   The past also has shown that Sanders, who considers himself a
hired gun, has no problem playing for a rival. He left Atlanta in
1994 to join NFC West Division competitors San Francisco. The San
Francisco 49ers won the Super Bowl that year, while ending the
Cowboys' quest for three consecutive Super Bowl titles.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he broke the hearts of San Francisco fans when he
joined the rival Cowboys and helped them regain the Super Bowl
title.

KENNEDY GETS ANOTHER DAY TO RECHARGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Second baseman Adam Kennedy was not in the starting
lineup for the second game in a row Wednesday, but he'll be back on
Friday when the Angels begin a three-game series against the
Dodgers at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Giving Kennedy the final two days of the month off seemed to be
a good idea considering the month Kennedy had. He hit .192 in May
after a .318 April. Kennedy had more RBI in one game _ eight on
April 18 at Toronto _ than in the entire month of May (five).
Overall, Kennedy is hitting .257.
</P>
<P>
   His problem at the plate isn't anything that can be corrected
simply by looking at videotape and making a few adjustments,
hitting coach Mickey Hatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a young guy struggles, most of it is in his head,''
Hatcher said. ``Right now, he's battling himself more than anything
he's doing mechanically. We know he can play. Right now he's
beating himself up fundamentally and mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing sometimes is just to take a couple of days off
and clear your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he has tried to remember how he felt and what he
was doing when he got off to such a hot start in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest picture from that time was I remember how the ball
was so big,'' Kennedy said. ``I could slow everything down. Now,
everything's happening so fast. I need to get back to everything
happening at a slower pace.''
</P>
<P>
   ON FINLEY: Wednesday's game was not the first time manager Mike
Scioscia has seen Chuck Finley pitch. Scioscia caught Finley in
1990 when the two were part of an All-Star team touring Japan.
</P>
<P>
   He said he understands the ties Finley has to many in the Angels
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1986 (when Finley joined the Angels) the pitching staffs
have evolved and the only constant was Chuck Finley,'' Scioscia
said. ``He was !ital!the!off! Angel starter for that long. He has
close friends here, but the game transcends that once you get on
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   SHORT HOPS: Pitcher Tim Belcher threw about 40 pitches during a
three-inning simulated game Wednesday and felt fine. He will go to
Fresno on Monday to pitch for Triple-A Edmonton on a rehab
assignment. He underwent offseason elbow surgery. He's expected to
make two rehab starts for the Trappers before joining the Angels
rotation around June 15.... Shortstop Benji Gil snapped an 0-for-24
slide with a single in the sixth inning Wednesday.... The Angels
are off today, then begin a six-game homestand against the Dodgers
and Giants starting Friday. &QL;

PENTAGON TEST-FIRES MISSILES TO FINISH TWA INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal crash investigators had the Pentagon
test-fire Stinger missiles last month off the coast of Florida to
see if the resulting streaks resembled those described by witnesses
to the explosion of TWA Flight 800, a spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board said on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The board has already concluded that the plane, a Boeing 747
that blew up off the coast of Long Island minutes after it left
Kennedy International Airport for Paris in July 1996, was not
brought down by a missile. And the spokesman said last month's test
did not change their conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing here should be construed to show that there's been any
new finding or change in the wreckage that we've been studying,''
said Ted Lopatkiewicz, the board's spokesman. ``This is part of our
effort to close all the open parts of the investigation.'' The
tests were first reported in Thursday's Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Safety Board plans to meet on Aug. 22 to consider a report
on the cause of the crash, which killed all 230 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The board has already said that the cause was an explosion in
the center fuel tank, and has conducted extensive laboratory work
demonstrating that an explosive atmosphere often develops in such
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The board's investigation has also shown that wiring defects
could, in theory, introduce a spark that would set off an
explosion. But it has not established precisely what set off the
tank, according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Lopatkiewicz said the board could issue a final report without
identifying the precise source of ignition.
</P>
<P>
   The board has already said that there is no hold in the wreckage
that would indicate a missile entry, and no metal bent by high
explosives of the kind used in a missle or a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   In major crashes, the safety board routinely prepares a report
on what witnesses saw, but in this case the investigators got a
very late start on that element of the investigation, because it
was handled by the FBI until only recently.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is unusual for an airplane to explode in flight,
investigators immediately after the crash looked hard for signs of
a bomb or missile, but eventually ruled out both possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's tests were conducted at Eglin Air Force Base in
Florida at a time of day when the sun was at an elevation similar
to its position at the time the plane exploded, and in similar
weather conditions. The team postponed the test on several
occasions until visibility was similar to the haze at dusk at the
time of the crash, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stinger is an Army missile. Civilian experts say its range
is probably insufficient to have reached Flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   There were 244 witnesses to the crash who said they saw streaks
of light.
</P>
<P>
   At hearings after the crash, board investigators said that after
an explosion severed the front part of the airplane, the remaining
part of the plane, including the wings and the bulk of the
fuselage, would have pitched up and climbed steeply, causing an
upward streak of light.

ON BASKETBALL: JACKSON AND PACERS EXPROPRIATE KNICKS' SWAGGER
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It was the middle of the third quarter, and Mark
Jackson, having been outplayed by the most maligned starting point
guard in pro basketball for much of the series, had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   He backed Charlie Ward into the post for the second straight
time, pounding the ball hard to the floor before releasing another
soft jump hook that rolled around and down.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers, who were out of this game _ and very likely
out of the Eastern Conference finals Friday night _ had startlingly
recovered from an 18-point first-half deficit to lead by seven.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, fed up with the posing and posturing of Larry Johnson
and those renegade New York Knicks, mockingly flashed the ``Big L''
sign toward the Knicks' bench after he scored.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Reggie Miller finished a 3-pointer over Allan Houston
by staring down the Knicks guard as if he had committed some
heinous act against a close relative.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks often live to display their cocksure behavior, preen
for America and NBC, bump chests until the cameras stop rolling.
But this is what their swagger sometimes begets, this is the other
half of showing people up on their home floor.
</P>
<P>
   They collapsed at the Conseco Fieldhouse Wednesday night, 88-79,
blowing a grand opportunity to go up by 3-2 in the best-of-7 series
and maybe close out the Pacers at Madison Square Garden less than
48 hours from now.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a complete meltdown, because they came back in the
fourth quarter and made it a tremendous game. But the music
performed over the weekend in New York _ the jazzy syncopation that
made them so entertaining and efficient _ was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Patrick Ewing was not to blame as much as an
almost arrogant attitude that seemed to take hold of the Knicks
midway through the second quarter. Did you see that eyesore? The
Pacers went on a 23-3 splurge, taking a halftime lead because the
Knicks suddenly got comfortable with their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana showed heart, especially Miller, Jalen Rose and Travis
Best, who finally looked for the open man before he dribbled the
shot clock away or took a bad shot. The Pacers showed the kind of
resolve the Knicks did over the weekend. But that run said so much
about the Knicks' ability to deal with prosperity, the feeling that
they got so far under Indiana's skin that the series was all but
over after their devastating 32-17 first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They genuinely thought they had this game won. That's the only
way to explain how the Pacers somehow grabbed three offensive
rebounds on one possession in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   When the Pacers began giving it back, going after loose balls,
flying through the lane without a care for their health, the Knicks
were suddenly the frustrated, poor-shooting team unable to find a
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Look, it's hard to completely knock this crew about what they
have been through. Rewind to that Game 5 loss in Miami that seemed
so long ago, and it is clear they do their best work when their
tank is flickering on empty.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers don't lie. Latrell Sprewell, dribbling furiously
with the shot clock running out, throwing up junk that amounted to
a 3-for-13 night. Johnson, invisible in the post after basking in
self-congratulatory fashion in Games 3 and 4, putting up a 2-for-8,
four-point line. The Knicks' bench, unable to put up enough offense
or defense to push the Pacers and make them think about going to
the Garden with their season on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who watched Derrick McKey hunt down an errant rebound on
the right baseline in front of the Knicks' bench with 4 1-2 minutes
left Wednesday night had to wonder how much those two victories at
the Garden last Saturday and Monday convinced the Knicks they were
finals-bound.
</P>
<P>
   For all the great play Ward has summoned in this series, neither
he nor Childs had an answer for Best and Jackson, who combined for
32 points and 10 assists to the Knicks backcourt's 12 points and
eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   A little anecdote from practice on Tuesday told you a lot about
these guys. Johnson began laughing, breaking up over the newfound
celebrity of a former teammate. It was not enough that they were
chanting Ward's name last weekend at the Garden. But holding court
in the rotunda after the game, using sarcasm and wit in front of
the cameras?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, C. Ward, I heard you were up at the podium yesterday,''
Johnson said. ``Man, that's just like Florida State.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward grinned, mimicked that crazy, left-handed running shot
Johnson somehow flicks in and tried to make an inconspicuous exit
to the locker room at SUNY-Purchase. Before he stepped off the
court, he was engulfed by bright lights, notebooks and
microcassette recorders.
</P>
<P>
   C. Ward, the former Heisman Trophy winner, was the big man on
campus again, sacrificing his body, quarterbacking another
nationally ranked team toward a crucial game.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice moment, but there was something altogether
premature about it, as if they didn't realize the series was
knotted at 2-2 and not 3-2, New York.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, rather than building a relationship with success,
they seem to treat it as some weekend fling that means nothing
until they're faced with an ultimatum. Win or book a flight to the
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, they have once again set themselves up for such a
predicament in Game 6 at the Garden Friday night. If Mark Jackson
is flashing the ``L'' sign toward their bench then, consider their
swagger and their resolve tapped out. &QL;

 DRUG OFFENSE MEASURE MAKES BALLOT  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ An initiative that would require anyone convicted
of a nonviolent drug offense be sent to a drug treatment center
instead of prison qualified for the November ballot Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million signature-gathering campaign was financed by
billionaire George Soros, who will also contribute toward its
passage. The initiative is being organized by the same group that
successfully campaigned for Proposition 215, the 1996 medical
marijuana measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This initiative represents a commitment to treating drug abuse
as a health problem, not a criminal justice problem,'' said Dave
Fratello, a spokesman for the campaign. ``Drug treatment is
effective not only at reducing drug abuse and addiction, but in
cutting criminal activity in users.''
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal is drawing fire from police groups and state
peace officers as a threat to public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Courts are designed to weigh the benefits of treatment for
individuals, said Robert Elsberg, a spokesman for the California
Police Officers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people are not good candidates for treatment,'' he
said. ``We know successful treatment works when there are
consequences _ this has treatment but no consequences for
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are about 20,000 inmates in the state prison
system doing time for simple possession. The Legislative Analyst's
Office said passage of the initiative would save taxpayers a net of
$100 million to $150 million in annual prison operation costs and
another $475 million to $575 million in prison construction costs.
Counties would save another $50 million annually in reduced jail
costs.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BALLOT01 (93644 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The proposal would be for nonviolent first- and second-time drug
offenders, Fratello said. Excluded is anyone caught dealing or with
large amounts of drugs, or who commits another crime at the same
time as possessing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, supports
the measure, citing the success of programs such as the Delancy
Street Foundation in San Francisco in ``taking addicts and
returning them to a successful role.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should treat drug abuses as health problems, not law
enforcement problems,'' said Burton, who makes no secret of his own
past use of cocaine. ``This frees up law enforcement to deal with
serious crimes, reduces overcrowding in prisons that jeopardizes
correctional officers, and frees up prison cells for serious and
violent criminals who need to be separated from society.''
</P>
<P>
   Also supporting the measure are San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown
and Sheriff Mike Hennessey.
</P>
<P>
   Elsberg said law enforcement supports treatment when it has been
proven successful, but warns there is no guarantee of success with
the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no definition of treatment, and no way to determine
success,'' he said. ``A person could go through the program and go
back to what they were doing before, like driving a school bus,
with no check-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argue that the treatment programs would be
court-approved, and therefore reliable.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second initiative that has gathered enough
signatures to be on the November ballot. The deadline for
qualification of an initiative is June 29.

STRUGGLING CLAYTON FINDS WAYS TO HELP RANGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Royce Clayton's offensive contributions have been
almost negligible the past two weeks. So the Rangers' slumping
shortstop went out last night and helped his team win by simply
playing the game right.
</P>
<P>
   He beat out a hit on what should have been a sacrifice bunt. He
went hard into second base to break up what could have been a
double play. On another play, he took second base when he noticed
the catcher couldn't find a ball that had rolled only a few feet
away. He had a bloop single and drew two walks that helped mount
big rallies.
</P>
<P>
   All those little things kept coming up big on a night when the
Rangers' offense overcame pitcher Darren Oliver's continuing
physical problems, leading to a 13-5 pounding of the Detroit Tigers
at Comerica Park. The victory allowed the Rangers to take two of
three from the Tigers and finish their three-city tour of the
Midwest with a 4-5 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little big things,'' outfielder Rusty Greer said. ``I think
that's what Royce is good at. We count on him making that little
big play and doing what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But any euphoria about the victory has to be tempered by
Oliver's situation. He complained of a dead arm after his previous
start against the Minnesota Twins and said it wasn't much better
last night, even though his radar-gun readings were back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have to miss a start,'' said Oliver, who is scheduled
to pitch Monday against the Los Angeles Dodgers. ``We'll see
Friday. Instead of getting stronger, it was getting weaker. I don't
care what the radar gun says; I know what my body says.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver gave up five runs on eight hits and five walks with two
strikeouts. He is 2-3 with a 5.98 ERA and was fortunate the Rangers
broke out the bats last night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers finished with 16 hits. Rafael Palmeiro went 3-for-6
with a home run and four runs batted in, Rusty Greer had four RBI,
Ruben Mateo went 3-for-5 and Luis Alicea had a two doubles, a
triple, two walks and four runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was the best we've swung the bats in a week,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton hasn't swung the bat well in a couple of weeks. He was
2-for-3 Tuesday, which helped slow down a 1-for-28 skid, and had
two more hits last night, but it has been a struggle for him
lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it's just been a couple of weeks,'' Clayton
said. ``The toughest thing was I lost my grandma a couple days ago,
other things outside baseball. I'm just looking forward to getting
back home, seeing my family and putting some stuff behind me. Hot
streaks, colds streaks, they come and go. Things outside baseball
are more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton is someone who loves to have fun in baseball, but that
doesn't seem to be the case right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here, do my job and go home,'' Clayton said. ``That's
how it's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fun part?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe one day it will come back,'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will have to settle for hard-nosed play. They were
leading 2-1 in the second when, with the bases loaded and one out,
Greer hit a double-play grounder to second baseman Jose Macias. But
Clayton went hard into shortstop Deivi Cruz, and his relay went
flying into the Rangers' dugout. Two runs scored, giving the
Rangers a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``From no runs to two runs,'' Oates said. ``Royce made it tough
for him. That's what you want everybody to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clayton: ``Even if you're not going well, you can still do
something to help the team win. It may not go big in the box
scores, but there are other ways to help a team win.'' nn

 FINE EXAMPLE OF HOW S.F. WORKS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I just got back from the Hallidie Mystery Plaza,
and the city is really blowing it there.
</P>
<P>
   This place, marketed correctly, could be San Francisco's biggest
attraction. Guided tours of the hole in the ground that confounds
science and bureaucracy! An amazing harmonic convergence where
nothing works!
</P>
<P>
   Tourists and locals alike will be amazed, astounded and injured!
</P>
<P>
   The plaza, being next to the cable car turnaround, a major
BART/ &QL; 
Muni station, major shopping and the tourist information center,
already has a zillion visitors a day, seeing all this stuff for
free. It's a cash cow sauntering around unmilked!
</P>
<P>
   I volunteer to be the barker.
</P>
<P>
   See the mysterious shifting stairway! The steps, granite slabs,
apparently were improperly installed. They have shifted, creating
tiny and large steps. It's a great spot for watching people slip
and trip.
</P>
<P>
   The DPW tells me they'll have the steps fixed soon; maybe Mayor
Brown could stall 'em.
</P>
<P>
   See the mysterious nonescalating escalators! They work as often
as my uncle Fred.
</P>
<P>
   The elevator repairmen tell me the problem is that the city
hoses off the plaza every day, and sometimes the drains clog and
the water backs up into the escalator mechanism and poof, another
month or two on the fritz.
</P>
<P>
   See the mysterious elevator, stalled by mysterious bureaucracy!
It's been out of action for a month or more.
</P>
<P>
   The 'vator belongs to the Department of Real Estate, but it
doesn't have the cash to fix it, the city's real estate being in
the horrible slump it's in.
</P>
<P>
   So they're handing off the problem to the DPW, but that handoff
could take who knows how long. And the DPW tells one merchant in
the plaza that the DPW doesn't have the money to fix the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   See the elderly, the large and the variously disabled claw their
way up the stairway I call Mt. Hallidie!
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, within minutes, I saw several people stumble, at
least two almost going down. I saw one woman crawl up the steps,
using her hands. Moms with baby carriages really work out! It's
like boot camp for civilians!
</P>
<P>
   I laughed so hard I had to rush through one of the few working
BART turnstiles to get to the men's room. It was out of order.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ARE the odds? (Note to mathematicians: That's just an
expression; I don't really want to know.)
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday night's Giants-Phillies game, Lance Greenfield saw a
fan seated just in front of the press box catch a foul ball. Very
next pitch, to the same Phillie batter, another foul ball, same
place, this one snagged by the first guy's pal, in the very next
seat.
</P>
<P>
   I tell you, that is a house of miracles.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: The city that doesn't hound celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously. I hear it often: Big star comes to town, is able to
walk streets, eat in restaurants without being smothered by gushing
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Either we're terribly cool, or not cool enough to know a star
when we see one. (Although a Mark McGwire, for instance, is hard to
miss.)
</P>
<P>
   Latest example: Ze lovely Charlize Theron (``Cider House
Rules'') and the lovely Stephan Jenkins (lead singer, Third Eye
Blind) have been hanging out in the Mission, at Foreign Cinema and
the newly reopened Brunos, giggling and snuggling, and nobody
bothers 'em (except me, in this item).
</P>
<P>
   CONVERSELY, this city treats should-be celebs like celebs.
</P>
<P>
   Example: The Mabel Mercer Foundation's annual Cabaret Convention
(415-441-5232) hits town for a week starting Monday, and about 90
talented performers, many of whom toil in semi-obscurity, will sing
for packed houses at USF's Gershwin Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Catch a preview Sunday when cab legend Billy Stritch performs at
a brunch/live KKSF broadcast at the Anza Restaurant in the Hotel
Nikko.
</P>
<P>
   COPS AND a TV crew riddled a Muni bus with automatic weapons
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because it was cool. This one has NRA fund-raiser potential
written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT RELIC for bid: A first-printing copy of the Declaration of
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Declaration will be auctioned off, online, on June 29 by
Sothebys. There are 25 known copies, 24 of which are in
institutions or headed to same.
</P>
<P>
   So this is your last chance to have the Dec for your rec room,
hanging between your bowling trophy and your mounted trout.
</P>
<P>
   The famed document will be on display this morning at Buck's
restaurant in Silicon Valley. Soon available, no doubt: Silk
jackets _ ``Declaration of Independence In-Yer-Face-John-Bull
National Tour '00.''
</P>
<P>
   Put your hands together, fans, for our country's nuttiest piece
of parchment.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I'm saving my money to bid on a George Washington rookie
card.
</P>
<P>
   SO WHAT if the S.F. cops shot the smithereens out of that Muni
bus?
</P>
<P>
   The important thing is that they finally ended the crime rampage
of Bonnie and Clyde.

THE DEBATE RAGES: CULTIVATING VS. IMPORTING A WORK FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Is there a shortage of high-tech workers in the
United States?
</P>
<P>
   The question dominates the H-1B debate in Congress, Silicon
Valley and all the Silicon Valley wannabes from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   If H-1B sounds like a new immunization recommended for infants,
you're not alone in your confusion. Unless you're involved in
immigration law or hiring high-tech workers, H-1B visas may not be
on your radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   They could be on your neighbor's, though. Consider the letter I
received Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of an Overland Park, Kan., man, who had earned a
bachelor's degree in electronic engineering technology and later
returned to school to add an associate degree in information
technology, wonders how he ``fell through the crack in this `good'
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his degrees, more than 20 years of job experience and
further work on an Microsoft certified systems engineer credential,
he makes less than $30,000 a year and has been downsized from
several jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Workers like these have trouble understanding the high-tech
industry's current push to increase _ or remove entirely _ limits
on the number of H-1B visas. These are three-year, renewable visas
that allow skilled, college-degreed foreign workers to work in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-tech industry trade groups are lobbying Congress to
raise H-1B limits. This year, U.S. employers reached the fiscal
year H-1B limit of 115,000 workers before the year was half over.
They say they desperately need foreign workers because they can't
find enough skilled workers domestically.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, those who oppose raising H-1B visa quotas say
there are plenty of willing and trainable workers in the United
States. They accuse employers of looking for cheap, temporary fixes
to fill jobs rather than investing in education and training for
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, both sides trot out statistics to support their
assertions. Also as usual, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   But seeping out of the high-tech office parks and oozing out of
my mail is persistent anecdotal evidence that America's older
workers aren't getting or keeping jobs in the high-tech world.
</P>
<P>
   Is it bald-faced age discrimination? Is it older workers'
inability to adapt to the high-tech pace of business? Inadequate
up-to-date skills? A problem of older workers expecting too much
pay?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, worker resentment is building against
allowing into America more young computer jockeys from, say, India
(which supplies the largest share of H-1B visa workers).
</P>
<P>
   It costs employers considerable time and money to wade though
the paperwork required to sponsor H-1B visas. One bill before the
U.S. House would double the H-1B filing fee.
</P>
<P>
   If, as many employers contend, it costs more to hire H-1B
workers (about $10,000 to $15,000 per worker, according to a
Microsoft hiring executive), why isn't it possible, if not more
sensible, to use that sum to train U.S. workers instead?
</P>
<P>
   I have no beef with welcoming more productive immigrants to
American soil. I'd just like to know we're cultivating the workers
already planted here.
</P>

 MCCAIN TOUTS GOP CANDIDATES IN BAY AREA VISIT  &HT;     By CAROLYNE ZINKO 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Arizona Sen. John McCain made his first visit to
the Bay Area Wednesday since the GOP presidential primary, boosting
Republican congressional candidates while only mildly stumping for
his former opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a swing through California on behalf of four candidates,
McCain appeared at a morning town hall meeting and a luncheon
fund-raiser for California Assemblyman Jim Cunneen, R-San Jose. He
also endorsed Tom Campbell for U.S. Senate. Campbell is leaving his
South Bay congressional seat to run against Democratic Sen. Dianne
Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Cunneen is running against Assemblyman Mike Honda, D-San Jose,
for Campbell's 15th Congressional District seat, one of a handful
of seats around the nation that both political parties consider key
to controlling the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists hoped that McCain's appearance would help
both Cunneen and Campbell draw the independents and Democrats who
voted for McCain in the March primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with the campaign that we had and the things
we were able to accomplish,'' McCain told more than 100 supporters
at a luncheon at the Santa Clara Marriott, which raised $50,000 for
Cunneen.
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted he was able to draw to the polls voters who usually
do not vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the Michigan primary, which he won, McCain said 38
percent of those who participated had never voted before &LR; . McCain
said he also won 20 percent of the African American vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush and I showed you can galvanize a group of voters to
vote that never voted before,'' McCain told the luncheon crowd.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said his message of reform and integrity connected with
disenchanted voters, and that Cunneen and Campbell have the same
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   McCain praised Cunneen as a candidate with the enthusiasm and
intellect to represent Silicon Valley, a district that is
influential in the House because of the valley's emergence as the
engine of economic growth for California and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He also took a page from his presidential campaign in lauding
Cunneen for integrity and independence.
</P>
<P>
   Cunneen was a co-author of a measure to require disclosure of
campaign financing on the Internet, and he was one of the few
Republicans to support Proposition 208. The voter-approved 1996
state initiative included limits on campaign contributions, but was
struck down by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   At both Cunneen events, McCain added praise for Bush, but it was
clearly secondary to the business that brought him to the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is obviously now to unite our party to elect George
W. Bush to president of the United States,'' he said at the
luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, the Democrats' Honda got a lift from House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who joined California Democratic
Reps. Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren in a rally with Million Mom March
participants and students at Santa Clara High School. Honda did not
attend, staying in Sacramento to vote on gun control measures in
the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at a Burlingame news conference to endorse Campbell,
McCain urged Bush to campaign heavily in California, saying it was
a ``very serious mistake'' for Republicans to concede the state in
1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said he did not know if he would campaign again in
California for Bush, although he will return to the state in
September or October for congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said his staff and Bush's are negotiating where he will
campaign, and that it appears he will spend more time in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McCain had appeared at a fund-raiser on behalf of
Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif. Rogan, one of the House members who
prosecuted President Clinton's impeachment, faces a re-election
struggle against state Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, in the 27th
Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also is scheduled to make appearances this week in the
36th Congressional District on the Palos Verdes peninsula, where
first-term incumbent Republican Steve Kuykendall faces a stiff
November challenge from Democrat Jane Harman, and in the 49th
Congressional District on the Southern California coast, where
two-term Republican incumbent Brian Bilbray is being challenged by
Assemblywoman Susan Davis, D-San Diego.

MISSOURI GAMING COMMISSION APPROVES SALE OF KANSAS CITY CASINO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The sale of the Flamingo Hilton Casino to
Mississippi-based Isle of Capri Casinos Inc. was unanimously
approved Wednesday by the Missouri Gaming Commission, and the
casino will change hands Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners meeting in Kansas City also proposed $500,000 in
fines against five casinos _ including all four in Kansas City _ in
the wake of an undercover sting operation resulting in allegations
that gamblers were being allowed to skirt the state's $500 loss
limit rules.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also proposed suspending four fraternal
organizations' bingo licenses for up to a year for multiple gaming
law violations, including operating illegal slot machines on the
premises. The Eagles club in Poplar Bluff is accused of running a
small casino in a back room that was accessible only by electronic
key card.
</P>
<P>
   All those fined have 30 days to appeal the action and force a
public hearing that would be conducted like a trial.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Flamingo, patrons won't notice the ownership change
until this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sale is to close Monday, the casino will remain
open under the Hilton Hotels Corp.'s Flamingo banner until the $15
million physical remodeling of the facility and conversion to
Isle's procedures are completed around Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes urged commissioners to ratify the
sale and license the company, the nation's eighth-largest gambling
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor noted the casino's 800 jobs and millions of tax
dollars it pumps into the city's coffers each year. ``I am
confident this Isle of Capri will be what we want in Kansas City,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Isle of Capri officials last month unveiled the casino's new
look at a Kansas City Port Authority meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, pink and purple flamingos, neon lights and other
flourishes will give way to the traditional look of a Missouri
River paddle-wheeler, said Kevin Mullally, deputy director of the
commission. ``We are clearly moving closer to a more appropriate
design,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a mild defense of the oft-maligned Flamingo's decor,
Mullally said river historians acknowledged that the old
paddle-wheelers were major entertainment destinations of their day
and typically were brightly colored and well lit at night to
attract customers.
</P>
<P>
   Capri President Jack Gallaway said a 150- to 200-room hotel
attached to the casino is likely to be announced within a year or
so. ``We're being careful not to commit to that,'' he told
commissioners, ``but that is a standard way we operate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City casino will be the 11th for Isle of Capri. It is
building No. 12 in Boonville, Mo., and is seeking commission
approval for No. 13 in south St. Louis County.
</P>
<P>
   Isle of Capri's founder and chairman, Bernard Goldstein, and
members of his family control about one-third of Isle's common
stock.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday after the commission's vote, Goldstein
said the company's expansion into Missouri was fueled partly by the
public's approval of casino gambling _ at the polls in several
elections and in record revenue still being logged by the state's
14 riverboat casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City is a terrific market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At hearings earlier this year, Goldstein was described as the
``godfather'' of modern riverboat gambling.
</P>
<P>
   He was a key player in winning the Iowa legislature's approval
of riverboat gambling in 1989. He subsequently operated two of the
nation's first modern-era riverboat casinos there in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He said Wednesday that he is surprised by the rapid growth of
the industry over the past 10 years. ``I thought it would just be
in Iowa,'' he said of the then-novel idea of picturesque gambling
boats plying the state's rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois and other states quickly followed Iowa's lead, which
saw legalized gambling as an economic shot in the arm to help the
recovery from recession.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, a scrap metal and river barge tycoon, founded Casino
America Inc. in 1990. The company changed its name in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein also is chairman of the board of the Alter Cos.,
including Alter Barge Line Inc. and Alter Trucking.
</P>
<P>
   Isle of Capri owns or has majority interest in riverboat casinos
in Iowa, Mississippi, Louisiana and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The company also owns the Pompano Park harness racing track and
poker club in Florida, and 50 percent of the Enchanted Capri cruise
ship that sails from New Orleans on Caribbean excursions. An Isle
of Capri casino is on board.
</P>
<P>
   In other action Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   - The commission made final its order for a $10,000 fine against
St. Jo Frontier Casino managing partner Bill Grace for misconduct
in May 1999 involving verbal profanity in public and his
unauthorized consumption of alcohol on the premises. Grace appealed
the original $15,000 proposed penalty, and several other charges
were dismissed after a formal hearing.
</P>
<P>
   - The commission proposed $100,000 fines apiece for Kansas
City's four casino companies and Harrah's in St. Louis. A two-day
undercover sting operation in March led to allegations that the
casinos violated loss limit rules.
</P>
<P>
   The commission offered no details about any of the infractions.
</P>
<P>
   John V. Finamore, Midwest president for Station Casinos Inc.,
was upset over the lack of information made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what we're guilty of,'' he said. ``The thing
that concerns us is the perception that we're flaunting the loss
limit rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Station has spent more than $500,000 on computers and employee
training designed to monitor loss limit compliance, Finamore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss limit rule is very challenging to enforce,'' he said.
``People make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   - The commission also proposed bingo license suspensions for VFW
posts in Lemay and Poplar Bluff, and Eagles clubs in Sikeston and
Poplar Bluff.

AMC FOURTH-QUARTER LOSSES EXCEED WALL STREET'S EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ AMC Entertainment Inc.'s reported loss of
$1.24 a share for its fourth quarter far exceeded the 75-cent to
99-cent loss Wall Street expected.
</P>
<P>
   Dragging the company down was its money-losing international
division; its older, obsolete multiplex theaters; and money spent
on building costly new megaplexes in an industry that's heavily
overbuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the number of movie screens in the United States has
increased three times as fast as attendance, and fewer movie
tickets were sold last year than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Company Chairman Peter Brown said in a conference call Wednesday
morning that 1999 was challenging for the industry and a year of
transition for AMC.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the movie exhibition industry was navigating choppy
seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But fortunately for us, we've got a great crew, we have a
wonderful ship, and in fact we view ours as a battleship on the
waters,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   For the company's fourth quarter, which ended March 30, losses
totaled $29.1 million, compared with a loss of $19.1 million, or 82
cents a share, for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Those losses came on record revenue of $262 million, compared
with $233 million for the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   AMC's adjusted cash flow for the fourth quarter was $8.7
million, down 18 percent from the same period a year ago. Adjusted
cash flow excludes costs for theater pre-opening and closure
expenses, which totaled $4.3 million for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, AMC lost $55.2 million, or $2.35 a share after a
restructuring charge, compared with a loss of $16 million, or 69
cents a share, the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Those losses came on record revenue of $1.17 billion, compared
with $1 billion in the previous year. Though attendance for the
year was down, revenue was helped by increases in AMC's ticket
prices, which averaged $4.93 in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.93 a ticket is more than a share of the company's stock,
which closed Wednesday at 4 3//4, up 7//16.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the company closed 279 multiplex screens
during the year and plans to close about 175 during this fiscal
year. However, AMC also plans to add about 120 screens.
</P>
<P>
   AMC's chief financial officer, Craig Ramsey, reviewed some
balance sheet concerns during the conference call:
</P>
<P>
   - The company has complied with all the covenants of its
financial agreements.
</P>
<P>
   - AMC has reduced its net debt to $703 million.
</P>
<P>
   - The availability of cash and access to its revolving credit
agreement stood at $207 million at the end of its fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans net capital spending of $100 million this year
and expects its debt to be flat to slightly down by the time it
reaches the end of fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The number of movie screens in the United States now is between
35,000 and 37,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry would be a lot healthier if the count was around
20,000,'' Brown said. ``It's going to take many, many, many years
to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel O'Neill, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said
he wasn't completely surprised by AMC's fourth-quarter loss because
he had recently drastically revised his estimate of losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, there's a lot to chew through in their
numbers,'' he said. ``I think AMC has the best circuit and should
do fairly well when and if things turn around. But it's going to be
some tough going for AMC and the industry.''

 LEATHERBACKS, LARGE SEA TURTLES, ENDANGERED BY COMMERCIAL FISHING  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Leatherback turtles, the world's largest sea
turtle and the only ones found off California, have plummeted in
numbers in the past two decades and could be extinct within a few
years, according to a study published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which appears in the scientific journal Nature,
concluded that leatherback turtles have declined primarily as a
result of commercial fishing activities. Large nets used for fish
and shrimp often entrap sea turtles, and long fishing lines can
snag them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, there were 115,000 adult female leatherback turtles in
the world's oceans, according to the study by scientists from
Drexel University in Philadelphia and the Center for Marine
Conservation. That number declined to 34,500 by 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The authors predict that the turtles may disappear entirely
unless comprehensive measures are taken to change fishing practices
and protect nesting beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Leatherback sea turtles differ from other marine sea turtles in
that they have smooth, leathery shells rather than the horny
carapaces typical of their relatives. They may reach a ton in
weight, and are often found far offshore, where they subsist on
jellyfish, crustaceans, fish and seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   They are the only marine turtle that habitually visits the cool
waters of the North Pacific. Until a few years ago, they were
commonly spotted off the Monterey coast and have been observed as
far north as Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Leatherbacks have already disappeared from waters off India, Sri
Lanka and Malaysia, areas where they were once common. The
scientists also noted dramatic declines in nesting colonies in
Mexico and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, the number of nesting leatherbacks declined from
70,000 in 1982 to fewer than 250 in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At Playa Grande, Costa Rica, the world's fourth-largest
leatherback nesting colony, egg-laying females declined from 1,367
for  &LR; in the 1988-89 nesting season to 117 for  &LR; in the 1998-99
season.
</P>
<P>
   The authors predict that Playa Grande's nesting population will
drop to 50 by 2003 unless comprehensive protective measures are
taken.
</P>
<P>
   The adult female leatherback population for the entire eastern
Pacific Ocean, the authors estimate, now stands at 1,690 _ down
from 91,000 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Because leatherbacks are long-lived  &LR; live 30 years or longer and
are slow to mature, continuity in breeding generations is needed to
assure species survival. The low numbers of mature females, the
authors conclude, means Pacific leatherbacks are on the brink of
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial fishing appears to be the cause of the decline.
Several types of fisheries kill sea turtles, including drift nets,
gill nets and long lines. The authors estimate that gill nets and
long lines alone  &LR; killed 1,500 mature female leatherbacks a year in
the Pacific through the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Eichenberg, a program counsel for the Center for Marine
Conservation who consulted on the article, said the federal
government has been ignoring the plight of leatherbacks and other
sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Marine Fisheries Service estimated there are
85,000 mature females left in the Pacific Ocean, when our best
research indicates no more than 5,000 are left,'' Eichenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit filed by the center against the fisheries service last
year resulted in the closure of a vast stretch of ocean off Hawaii
to long-line fishing while the agency prepares a new study on the
status of the area's sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before our suit, there were 15 million hooks running each year
in that fishery,'' said Eichenberg. ``Some of the sets were 30
miles long. It was destroying a tremendous amount of non-target
species, including turtles.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisheries service representatives could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   John McCosker, a marine biologist and senior scientist with the
California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, said the
technology exists to prevent widespread turtle mortality _ but that
global trade agreements have hindered its employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turtle exclusion devices have been developed for shrimp and
fish nets that work very well,'' McCosker said, ``and fishermen are
generally willing to use them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, many countries are reluctant to require them,
because the World Trade Organization views any attempt to impose
environmental regulations on the taking and marketing of seafood as
a trade barrier,'' he said.

LANDMARK AGREEMENT REDUCES RISK OF CATASTROPHIC OIL SPILL
ALONG  WEST COAST
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JIM DOYLE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Large ships will be cruising farther off the
Central California coast, thanks to a landmark agreement designed
to reduce the risk of a catastrophic oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of government regulators, shippers and
conservationists took years of informal talks, negotiations and
approvals at various levels to hammer out the voluntary compromise.
Environmentalists had pressed for mandatory regulations, which
shippers opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The new sea lanes are ``a major environmental victory,'' said
Warner Chabot, a regional director for the Center for Marine
Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could, the cormorants and sea otters and other marine
life would applaud you,'' Chabot told an assembled group of
bureaucrats, maritime industry officials and others who labored to
put together the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The new sea lanes, approved last week by the International
Maritime Organization in London, are designed to prevent collisions
and groundings among the thousands of commercial vessels that ply
the waters between Los Angeles and San Francisco, the busiest
shipping corridor in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The new routes were prompted in part by Alaska's nightmarish
Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 and also by a vexing spill last year off
Coos Bay, Ore. In that incident, rough seas prevented rescue
workers from recovering a freighter's fuel before it washed ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National &AMP; Oceanic Atmospheric Association and
the U.S. Coast Guard highlighted the fine points of the agreement
Wednesday at a news conference on Yerba Buena Island.
</P>
<P>
   The new sea lanes are slated to go into effect in less than six
months, once U.S. and foreign shippers are notified and navigation
charts are altered.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to freeway lanes, the sea lanes include northbound and
southbound corridors for large commercial vessels, as well as
separate routes for ships carrying hazardous materials such as
liquefied gases and other toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This helps keep an accident from happening,'' said Scott
Gudes, a NOAA official, who praised the unique partnership between
federal and state regulators, the shipping and oil industries, bar
pilots, port officials, fishermen and environmentalists that led to
ratification of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very encouraging that these diverse groups came together
and hashed out the details,'' said Vice Admiral Ernest Riutta,
commander of the Coast Guard for the Pacific Area. ``The fact that
we're all here today and still talking to each other reflects the
spirit of the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 large vessels make their way along the Central
California coast every year, most traveling between 2.5 and 15
miles offshore. Each carries up to 1 million gallons of bunker
fuel, a heavy fuel similar to crude oil, which they use in their
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Routing vessels farther offshore, officials said, will provide
more time for rescue tugs and aircraft to respond to disabled
vessels to prevent them from grounding and spilling their fuel. The
new routes also will further separate commercial traffic from the
fishing boats and recreational vessels that typically travel closer
to shore.
</P>
<P>
   The new shipping lanes are aimed at preserving the rugged
Central California coastline, especially the waters of four
national marine sanctuaries that commercial cargo vessels pass
through.
</P>
<P>
   The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, the nation's largest
offshore refuge, has the greatest biodiversity of cold-water marine
life in the world. Its kelp forests provide habitat for a wide
range of wildlife, including rare sea otters, sea birds, fish and
invertebrates, many of which are particularly susceptible to the
effects of an oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major spill can kill thousands of animals,'' said Holly
Price, water quality director for the sanctuary. ``The name of the
game here is prevention _ preventing that oil from reaching the
coast.''
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary measures call for large commercial vessels, such
as bulk freighters and container ships, to use north-south tracks
ranging from 13 to 20 nautical miles offshore along much of the
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Ships carrying hazardous chemicals will be asked to stay within
sea lanes between 25 to 30 nautical miles offshore. Under a
pre-existing treaty, oil tankers would remain at least 50 nautical
miles from shore.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Farr, a Monterey Democrat, praised the shipping
industry's participation in the sea lanes agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do this without the role of the private sector,'' he
said. ``It's their ships. It's their fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, freighters have hugged the California coastline
from Point Pinos to Point Arguello in an effort to reduce the
distance between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The new routes will
add 20 to 30 minutes of travel time for commercial ships between
those two ports.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times it was contentious. There were arguments,'' said John
McLaurin, president of the Pacific Merchant Shipping Association.
Shippers wanted to maintain the status quo, while others wanted to
move large freighters as much as 80 nautical miles offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators said they expect most shippers will comply
with the new sea lanes. A previous study of oil tankers on the
Alaska trade route found that 92 percent adhered to the 50-mile
limit.
</P>
<P>
   The shipping lane proposal was developed through a two-year
collaborative effort led by the Monterey Bay National Marine
Sanctuary and the U.S. Coast Guard. It took an additional two years
for the international agreement to win approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of grumbling'' by conservationists, said Vicki
Nichols, a director of research and policy for Save Our Shores, a
Santa Cruz-based environmental group.

KANSAS CITY PROVIDERS TO COMBINE CANCER TREATMENT PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In a move that could improve treatment for
area cancer patients, longtime rivals Health Midwest and St.
Luke's-Shawnee Mission Health System have signed an agreement to
combine their cancer programs.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the two health systems said on Wednesday that they
plan to complete a feasibility study within 90 days, finish an
unprecedented agreement shortly thereafter and begin joint
operations early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes amid a broader effort to make Kansas City a
national center for life sciences research.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the combined program to give area residents
access to more sophisticated equipment and expanded treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Program leaders also intend to apply within two years to the
National Cancer Institute for designation as a regional
comprehensive cancer center _ the first in the four-state area.
This designation would likely lead to greater funding from the
National Institutes of Health and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working together, we want to build upon our individual
strengths in a way that will enhance the delivery of cancer
services to the community,'' said Richard W. Brown, president and
chief executive officer of Health Midwest, and G. Richard Hastings,
president and chief executive officer of St. Luke's-Shawnee
Mission, in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   The health systems intend to share the cost of upgraded
technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cranshaw, senior vice president of strategic planning for
Health Midwest, said reducing unnecessary duplication in cancer
programs would ``free up funds for investing in new pieces of
equipment not already in the community, thereby increasing quality
and reducing the need for patients to leave the area for
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Health Midwest includes 15 hospitals and St. Luke's operates
eight, making the health systems the largest in the Kansas City
area.
</P>
<P>
   Health care consultant Gail Shafton, president of Cue Resources
Inc. in Overland Park, said she was stunned by the announcement of
cooperation..
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been rivals in every conceivable way for at least
the last decade,'' said Shafton, who has worked in the area
health-care arena since the 1980s. ``Their whole point in
organizing delivery systems has been to capture market share from
each other. I'm thrilled that they are finding a place to establish
common ground....''
</P>
<P>
   The combined program could pose a competitive threat to services
offered by the University of Kansas Medical Center, both for
patients and national funding, Shafton noted.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Ball, a spokeswoman for KU Medical Center, said the
area will always need the type of research and patient care that is
performed by a teaching hospital such as KU.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incidence of cancer continues to increase, and KU Med
believes the expansion of services for cancer patients helps
everyone in the community,'' Ball said. ``As the region's academic
medical center, KU Med physicians and research scientists are
developing new cancer diagnostic and treatment methods. And KU
Med's patients have access to these and other leading national
clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined program would come under the direction of a
governing board that would be established later. The health systems
are studying the needed regulatory approvals.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Hastings said they want to develop a first-class
cancer center on par with the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the Kansas City community is rich with excellent
oncology practitioners and cancer services, there is no single
comprehensive program to which cancer patients and their families
may turn,'' the two leaders said in their joint statement. ``In
fact, no such center is available within the four-state region of
Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site, the National Cancer Institute says its
comprehensive cancer centers ``are the major source of new
knowledge relating to the nature of cancer and the major source of
new and more effective approaches to prevention, detection,
diagnosis and therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Such centers also engage in community outreach and education
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement was made at the Stowers Institute for
Medical Research, which plans to begin work late this year. Brown
and Hastings said the Health Midwest-St. Luke's program would work
with Stowers, which is spearheading heightened interest in life
sciences research in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   William B. Neaves, president of Stowers, said in a prepared
statement that ``by laying the foundation for the first
NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in this region of the
U.S., Health Midwest and St. Luke's-Shawnee Mission Health System
demonstrate the spirit of cooperation that will make Kansas City a
national center of excellence in biomedical science.''
</P>
<P>
   Neaves said Stowers would use its cancer-related research to
help obtain the comprehensive cancer designation for Kansas City.
Other area institutions also should cooperate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Hastings said there were no plans on the table to
build new facilities for the combined program, which would continue
to offer services at various locations operated by the two health
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at program integration,'' Hastings said. ``The
facility component is secondary. This will be a cancer center
without walls.''

ANTITRUST SUIT JUDGE TO DETERMINE FATE OF TWO SAN

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The judge commanded the spotlight during closing
arguments Wednesday in Clint Reilly's lawsuit to block the Hearst
Corp. from buying The Chronicle, pointedly questioning lawyers on
the terms of the sale, Reilly's standing to sue and the legality of
the Fang family's acquisition of the Hearst-owned Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   After more than four hours of argument, U.S. District Judge
Vaughn Walker took the case under submission and, without
specifying a date, pledged to try to reach a ``prompt decision'' in
an antitrust suit with far-reaching implications for the nation's
newspaper industry.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first case ever to challenge the attempted dissolution
of a joint operating agreement, an exemption to federal antitrust
law that allows competing newspapers such as The Chronicle and the
Examiner to split profits and share printing and other business
operations while maintaining editorial independence.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, a real estate investor and former mayoral candidate,
filed the lawsuit in January, claiming that Hearst intended to
create an illegal monopoly by purchasing The Chronicle and giving
the Examiner _ plus up to $66 million in subsidies over three years
_ to the Fangs, publishers of the San Francisco Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's ruling in the case could make it more difficult for
newspapers publishing under joint operating agreements in 12 other
cities to dissolve or amend those agreements. In recent years, 15
joint operating agreements have been dissolved, most with little
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's lawyer, Joseph Alioto, opened the proceedings Wednesday
by insisting that Hearst is using the joint operating agreement as
``a stepping stone to monopoly.'' He argued that Hearst could sell
the Examiner with its share of the joint operating agreement, or
close the Examiner after the agreement expired in 2005, but could
not buy The Chronicle ``because that would be a monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Alioto did not get far, though, before Walker peppered him with
questions about how Hearst's deal with the Fangs would violate
antitrust laws _ and cause Reilly ``economic'' harm, a prerequisite
to filing an antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto responded that the Examiner deal is ``a sham and a
farce'' that furthers Hearst's monopoly scheme because the company
knows the paper cannot survive under Fang ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be kind,'' said Alioto, ``it is a down and dirty bribe. ...
Don't make this paper work and we will reward you'' with $66
million.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed further by Walker, Alioto contended that the deal is
anticompetitive because it stops Hearst and The Chronicle from
competing after the joint operating agreement expires in 2005,
something that internal emails show the papers clearly intended to
do, said Alioto.
</P>
<P>
   Walker then questioned Alioto on two provisions of the joint
operating agreement that Alioto contends are illegal. One
essentially blocks the sale of either newspaper to a competitor
within 60 miles of San Francisco, and the second gives each paper
the right to match any offer for the other paper.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto argued that the provisions hurt Reilly and other
consumers because Hearst does not ``have to worry about another
competitor coming into the market'' to buy the Chronicle and
driving down advertising and subscription rates with increased
competition.
</P>
<P>
   When Alioto explained further that, even though The Chronicle
and the Examiner together fix advertising rates, nothing in the
joint operating agreement specifically allows them to do so, Walker
caught him by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the parties have fixed prices,'' asked the judge, ``and
that is not covered by the joint operating agreement, is it
out-and-out (illegal) price fixing?''
</P>
<P>
   After a pause, Alioto responded with a laugh, ``It wasn't until
now, judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Alioto to the podium was The Chronicle's attorney, J.
Thomas Rosch, who said his client ``now knows what it is like to
live between the Hatfields and the McCoys,'' or, in this case,
Reilly and Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Walker immediately asked Rosch why Hearst's deal with the Fangs
_ and particularly the $66 million subsidy _ was not a wasteful and
anticompetitive attempt to preserve a failing newspaper that should
be allowed to die.
</P>
<P>
   Rosch responded that there was no proof that the Fang's
acquisition of the Examiner would reduce competition, but Walker
pressed the issue by asking whether there was any reason for the
transaction other than to ``curry favor with (the U.S. Department
of) Justice and local political figures.''
</P>
<P>
   After suggesting that the answer was better left to Hearst,
Rosch discussed the two provisions in the joint operating agreement
that Alioto contended were illegal. Rosch insisted that there was
not ``a shred of evidence'' that either provision affected The
Chronicle's sale price and, in any event, Reilly could not show
that he suffered any injury if Hearst ``got this paper on the
cheap'' _ and so could not have standing to challenge the
provisions under antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   The judge then returned to the Fangs' acquisition of the
Examiner. He asked why the Department of Justice had claimed in a
press release announcing approval of the deal that a Fang-owned
Examiner would be ``fully competitive'' with The Chronicle when it
was clear the paper would be only a scaled-down product focusing on
San Francisco neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Rosch explained that the Fangs would be able to operate the
paper in ways that Hearst could not, but Walker was not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that supports Mr. Alioto's theory,'' said Walker, ``that
something else is going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker continued this line of questioning with Hearst's
attorney, Gary Halling. Halling responded that Hearst had never
said the Examiner would compete with The Chronicle throughout the
Bay Area and, in any event, ``we did not write the press release.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge then asked why Hearst was willing to give the Fangs
the Examiner and a $66 million subsidy rather than shut the
newspaper down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is,'' said Halling, ``that Hearst could not afford
the delay'' caused by the Justice Department's insistence that a
buyer for the Examiner be found. ``The contract we signed with The
Chronicle had a deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   David Balabanian, the Fangs' attorney, was the last lawyer to
speak. He defended his earlier claims that the ``new'' Examiner
would be ``fully competitive'' with The Chronicle, but said he
``did not suggest in any way'' that it would be a ``metropolitan''
newspaper covering the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, though, responded that there was ``an awful lot said
that does not appear to be forthright.''
</P>
<P>
   In his argument, Balabanian contended that the type of Examiner
planned by the Fangs _ a morning paper with smaller circulation _
is ``the only paper that makes any sense.'' He also explained that
the Fangs wanted the Examiner's share of the joint operating
agreement but were willing to accept the subsidy offered by Hearst
as a substitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spending money unwisely,'' he said, ``has never been an
antitrust violation.''

STILL HOPING TO BUY RACETRACK, TRIBE PRESSES FORWARD ON CASINO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ Workers have begun refurbishing and
converting the nearly century-old Scottish Rite temple in downtown
Kansas City, Kan., into a three-story casino _ with no parking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming Soon'' signs announcing the gambling hall should be up
by the end of the week, said Jim Bland, second chief of the
Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma, which owns the brick building across
the street from City Hall and police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've waited as long as we're going to wait,'' said Bland. ``A
casino is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, tribal officials acknowledge that their
announcement is mostly a gambit to force federal, state and local
officials to negotiate a deal that would put the casino at The
Woodlands racetrack in western Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be here,'' said Bland. ``The Woodlands is our
No. 1 choice. But we are going full-bore ahead right now to upgrade
that place and fix it so that a casino can be put in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case we finally do go somewhere else, we'll still want to
use that building for other projects _ a museum or a cultural
center or a meeting facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities four years ago cleared the way for
high-stakes tribal bingo in the Scottish Rite building _ regarded
as special tribal reservation land. But the tribe has held off on
those plans while hoping to win approval for full-scale casino
gambling at The Woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal legislation that could allow that to happen
has been stalled for years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the tribe has appealed to federal tribal-regulatory
authorities to upgrade its reservation bingo gaming license for the
Scottish Rite building to also permit slot machines and other
casino style games.
</P>
<P>
   If everything goes as planned, Bland said, the casino could open
sometime this fall.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Dave McCullough, the tribe's Oklahoma-based
lawyer, said the tribe's gambit would have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to invest that money in another site,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city certainly won't be happy about the location. We hope
the idea that we're going forward will bring some people to the
table to talk about some options.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials support the tribe's efforts to locate at the
financially struggling racetrack but probably would resist any
effort to operate a casino in the shadow of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thinks the downtown site is an optimum site,'' said
Unified Government Administrator Dennis Hays. ``We will stand with
the Wyandotte Nation in their effort to get gaming at The
Woodlands. That is the best possible solution for everyone and
would be a great economic boom for Wyandotte County.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodlands' managing partner Bill Grace has said he is willing to
sell the track to the tribe and then lease back parts of it to
continue horse and greyhound racing while the tribe operates a
casino.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish Rite building was erected in 1906 and was largely
rebuilt in 1951 after a fire. Its half-acre site has no room for
parking. If the tribe's casino patrons park illegally downtown,
Unified Government spokesman Don Denney suggested that the city
might be towing a lot of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Bland said the tribe was working on the parking problem and
probably would have patrons park elsewhere and ride shuttle buses
to the casino.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe and its partner, North American Sports Management, a
Maitland, Fla., real estate developer, still face legal hurdles
before opening a gambling parlor anywhere in Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Topeka, Kan., this year dismissed a lawsuit
filed by Kansas that sought to block the tribe's downtown casino
plan. But the state has appealed, keeping the lawsuit alive.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish Rite temple site is next to the tribe's historic
Huron Indian Cemetery. A 1997 federal law prohibits the tribe from
using the cemetery grounds for gambling. That law was passed in
response to the tribe's plans at the time for a casino on pillars
that would have occupied the air space over the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate the tribe for voiding its cemetery land rights,
legislation is pending in Congress that would permit the tribe to
buy land virtually anywhere else in Wyandotte County for a casino.
</P>
<P>
   That measure, sponsored by Rep. Dennis Moore, a Lenexa Democrat,
was approved by a House committee last summer and awaits floor
debate.
</P>
<P>
   An unrelated federal court case pending in Florida also could
determine whether state government approval is needed for Indian
casinos off-reservation or on special land such as the Scottish
Rite site.

GOP CANDIDATE SPEAKS OUT AGAINST REPUBLICAN PARTY LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As national GOP leaders appeared to favor
another latecomer candidate, Republican congressional contender
Teresa Loar charged Wednesday that ``there's no room for women''
inside her party.
</P>
<P>
   Loar, running for the 6th District congressional seat being
vacated by Democrat Pat Danner, said party leaders such as U.S.
House Speaker Dennis Hastert had switched their allegiance to state
Sen. Sam Graves, a new entrant.
</P>
<P>
   Loar, a Kansas City councilwoman, said she got into the race
last year after Hastert encouraged her to run. Back then Danner was
gearing up to campaign for a fifth term, and the race looked far
more formidable for a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened to me in the last week must be indicative of a
party where there's no room for women,'' Loar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustration as a woman in political office is
undescribable anyway. To get kicked around like this by my own
party is so disheartening.''
</P>
<P>
   Although discouraged by the GOP leaders' actions, Loar said she
was energized by Graves' entry and confident she could still win
the Aug. 8 primary.
</P>
<P>
   She said party leaders recruited Graves after Danner announced
last week that she was abandoning her re-election effort. Danner
disclosed earlier this year that she was undergoing treatment for
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders are eager to get Graves into Congress because he's
a ``white conservative male as opposed to a moderate female,'' Loar
said.
</P>
<P>
   Graves would ``help them maintain their power base in
Washington,'' Loar said of the conservative House leaders. ``A
moderate female would erode that base.''
</P>
<P>
   Loar favors abortion rights; Graves is regarded as an abortion
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Graves said his opponent was off base. He said he was recruited
because as a state senator he represents 16 of the congressional
district's 27 counties in northwest Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know why she's saying something like that,''
Graves said. ``It sounds to me like she's just lashing out.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves noted that four of Missouri's six women senators are
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri officials reopened candidate filing, as required by
law, for five days after Danner withdrew May 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is, this isn't the same race,'' Graves
said. ``This is a brand new race. That's the reason we have laws
that open it back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves said Hastert was expected to visit the district this
summer to help him raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Hastert, Graves said he was encouraged to enter the race
by House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
and Rep. Tom Davis, chairman of the National Republican Campaign
Committee. Republican members of Congress from Missouri also
called, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are defending a narrow House majority in the fall
elections, and Danner is only the eighth Democrat to retire,
compared with 23 GOP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP poll conducted after Danner announced her withdrawal
reportedly showed Graves with better than a 2-to-1 edge over Loar.
It also showed the largely rural district as strongly
anti-abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wilkinson, a spokesman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said the party would not endorse any
candidate in the primary. Individual Republican leaders, though,
can do what they wish, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some think Graves is the best candidate, so be it,'' he
said. ``She needs to calm down a little bit.''

 BUSH CAMPAIGN HITS CALIFORNIA TRAIL IN GORE'S ABSENCE  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the brilliance of Lake Tahoe as a backdrop, Texas Governor
George W. Bush will deliver a high-profile speech on the
environment Thursday _ and tomorrow, he will share a platform on
border issues with Vice President Al Gore's biggest state
supporter, Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The big visit leads Democrats in California to the big question:
What's up with Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   With Bush tramping across the nation's most populous state every
two weeks since the March 7 primary, the oft-repeated query
underscores a sobering reality for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Even with five months to go before the election, and a
comfortable nine-point lead in California, some Democrats are
starting to get antsy about his chances and worry that his poor
showing in national polls may be threatening the party's chances of
taking back control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In California _ a crucial state he has visited 67 times _ Gore's
friends and supporters say the guy they know is funny, warm and
smart as a whip. But his repeated attacks on Bush, they say, not
only fail to sell Gore's strengths, they have resulted in erosion
in polls, especially among women.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls, such as the ABC News /Washington Post poll this
month, have given Bush a five-point edge nationally, and a Harris
Interactive poll released Wednesday shows a distinct edge for Bush
in the congeniality department: Americans ranked him the candidate
they'd most like to go to dinner with, have a drink with, go to a
baseball game with and be stranded on a desert island with.
</P>
<P>
   News reports from Washington this week suggest that even
President Clinton has made a behind-the-scenes attempt to lighten
up Gore's attacks and stress a more positive message for the party
in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most prepared guy ever to run for president,'' said
one Gore friend and leading state supporter. ``I'd have him parked
in front of the media. I don't think it's to his advantage to
appear to be inaccessible to real people.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP insiders insist that Gore's campaign has already done its
damage, turning off many female voters who appear to be gravitating
to a warmer appeal from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting calls from Democratic women who are saying, `I'm
interested in knowing more,''' said Kristin Heuter, one of the
nation's powerhouse GOP fund-raisers, who marvels how potential
donors are jamming the phones to participate in upcoming Bush
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking at Gore and saying `there's nothing special
about this man' ... (but) when they meet Bush and look in his eyes,
they like him _ and they trust him. There's a warmth. He's
genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans say it's more than personality _ and that
Bush's positive approach is resonating with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats ``have tried to run a campaign to do two things: tear
down their opponent and paint them in a corner as extremist,'' said
Leslie Goodman, a GOP communications consultant who has worked in
the past with the Bush campaign. ``And they can't do that this time
around (because) the messenger doesn't fit. In Bush (Republicans)
have a bold vision ... and Gore has been a follower for eight
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is hoping to take advantage of any opening in California.
He is appearing tomorrow at the Border Governors conference in
Sacramento alongside Davis, who is hosting the event. And he is
coming back June 19 for events and fund-raisers in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush on such a roll, even Gore's most loyal supporters
admit they'd like to see a different tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few people in the insider group who agree that
Al Gore should be using such a heavy hand in his attacks,'' said
one high-level Gore supporter who declined to be named. ``They
continue to believe it doesn't serve him well. He doesn't need
that.''
</P>
<P>
   State Controller Kathleen Connell, who has appeared alongside
Gore on numerous occasions, is one of many state Democrats who
maintain that Gore, in person, is genuine, ``very warm, and very
concerned'' about issues that matter to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd like to see him do more of is talk about the vision
for the 21st century,'' she said. ``As a mother, an executive, an
elected official, what would resonate with me is: Where are we
going to be 10 years from now?''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats, like campaign consultant Gale Kauffman, also
profess to be confounded by Gore's strategy. ``You don't really see
a consistent set of tactics,'' said Kauffman, who helped shape Bill
Bradley's challenge to Gore in California. While she cautioned that
it is still early in the campaign, ``good Democrats are saying
they're for Gore ... but there doesn't seem to be a lot of
passion.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Gore campaign has signaled it is making changes _
fast.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Gore's life, his devotion to family and his
personal history _ from being a divinity student to his service in
Vietnam _ will be the subject of ads and campaign material in the
next weeks, campaign insiders say. The goal: humanizing a man who
has been publicly depicted as a cautious politician too eager to
pander.
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself has taken to a more positive message, stressing
initiatives on the environment in recent days while accepting the
endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters. He is also
unveiling a family-friendly agenda, talking Thursday about
cancer-fighting initiatives. Wednesday, he made an unusually
emotional joint appearance with his wife, Tipper, to unveil a
mental health initiative. Tipper Gore also held a conference call
with regional medical reporters last Thursday on the issue of
mental health, signaling her increased visibility on issue-related
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and supporters say such changes are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing people are unaware of is how much Gore is a
demonstrated, committed family man,'' said Martha Whetstone, a
friend of both the Gores and the Clintons. `` ``People haven't seen
that side of them. It's very positive, and it will resonate.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry South, the consultant who advised Davis on his landslide
1998 victory, warns that Republicans shouldn't be overconfident
about their candidate's appeal to voters. And Democrats, especially
women, he said, need to shake off the nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bush) has had a good two-month run, I wouldn't deny it,''
South said. ``But he's gotten a free ride so far. ... Even moderate
Republican women, when they find out where he stands on issues, are
aghast.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters simply have not focused their attention yet on the
election, South said, and they won't really be paying attention to
the issues until after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   But South also argued that the Gore campaign will not _ and
should not _ easily give up the attack mode on Bush's record in
Texas as the campaign heads into the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election is not a personality contest,'' South said.
``Someone has to take the state of Texas and hold it up like a
mirror, and say, `Look folks,' '' on issues ranging from child care
and environment to guns and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when that happens,'' said South, ``you will see this guy
Bush melt like a pat of butter on a hot driveway.''

LIBRARY OF CONGRESS EXHIBITS WILLIAM `THE MISSOURI KID' RUDOLPH
STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Historians describe him as the most notorious
Missouri bank robber and killer of his time _ but his name wasn't
Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   William ``The Missouri Kid'' Rudolph became a featured exhibit
Wednesday at the Library of Congress, which is displaying a portion
of 88 years of records recently received from the famed Pinkerton
detective agency.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton archivist Jane Adler said Rudolph's story was one of
the most interesting she uncovered in three years of sorting
through thousands of Pinkerton files from 1850 to 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph and an accomplice, George Collins, robbed a bank in
Union, Mo., near St. Louis at midnight on Dec. 26, 1902. Rudolph
relied on the blasting skills he developed as a miner to blow up
the bank safe and steal $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   A posse tracked Rudolph, 20 at the time, using only a boyhood
picture. Rudolph and Collins were holed up in a cabin near Stanton,
Mo., when a young Pinkerton agent posing as a hunter knocked on the
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``He very obviously was not a hunter. He was a detective and
they shot him in the head,'' Adler told library officials.
</P>
<P>
   The inexperienced detective, Charles Schumacher, was the son of
a popular Pinkerton superintendent. From that moment, Rudolph
became the target of the most intense manhunt in Pinkerton history,
Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He only killed one man, but it was the wrong man to kill,''
Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened of being captured, Rudolph got himself arrested and
jailed in St. Louis County on a lesser offense. He hoped he
wouldn't be recognized as Schumacher's killer and that the manhunt
would end by the time he got out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   The ruse failed, and Rudolph was held on the murder charge.
Adler said Rudolph then decided the best way to escape execution
was to throw himself on the mercy of Pinkerton head William
Pinkerton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't only ask this of you for myself, but for my dear old
mother's sake,'' Rudolph pleaded in one of two neatly written
letters from April and May 1903. ``I beg you to use your powerful
influence with the governor to have my sentence commuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting no response, Rudolph's next option was to escape, which
he did on July 6, 1903, a week before his trial. That set off
another manhunt that ended in his recapture on Feb. 25, 1904.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers kept close track of Rudolph's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the start of yellow journalism, and he was the first
celebrity criminal,'' Adler said. Jesse James lived and died before
newspapers were as widespread, and the fame of outlaws like Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid peaked after they died, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins also was captured, put in Franklin County Jail with
Rudolph, tried and sentenced to death. Rudolph was forced to
witness the hanging on March 26, 1904.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took him to a building overlooking the courtyard to
watch,'' Adler said. ``He cried.'' On May 8, Rudolph also was
hanged.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the letters from Rudolph to Pinkerton, the
Library of Congress received pictures, wanted posters, news
clippings, criminal records sheets and other documents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those were displayed for reporters Wednesday, along with
pictures and records on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. In all,
Pinkerton donated 92 boxes of materials to the library that had
been private for up to 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This piece of history is preserved here, where it will always
be available to the citizens of the United States and around the
world,'' said James H. Billington, who heads the Library of
Congress.

SPORTS COLUMN: HOLZMAN HAD THE FORMULA FOR WINNING 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ He would listen in as the news media know-it-alls
argued over dinner and drinks, the debate raging over the
establishment of the half-court game against the need to get out
and run. Twenty years ago, and probably 20 years before that, the
extreme strategic positions were all the source of comic amusement
to the sagacious basketball lifer.
</P>
<P>
   Red Holzman would invariably begin his arbitration with a
perfectly timed heh-heh, and then he would say, ``Fellas,
basketball is basketball.'' Which was his way of sermonizing that
the game was no more a track meet than it was a tractor pull. It
was and always would be about execution and effort, about reacting
to the moment at hand.
</P>
<P>
   You can pretty much guarantee that the team seeking to redefine
itself in the playoffs is the team that lost the last game. So the
Pacers, back home at Conseco Fieldhouse on Wednesday night, were
suddenly enveloped in the same identity crisis the Knicks have
often mired themselves in on successive playoff campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what Larry Bird said, `When you lose, the players always
say you should do something else,''' Jeff Van Gundy said before the
Pacers shocked the Knicks, rallying from 18 down in the first half
and winning Game 5, 88-79, for a 3-2 lead in the Eastern Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   From management on down, the Pacers had come into this game
offering more propositions than a California voting booth. The
Pacers' ownership stooped to the bush-league level of begging
ticket brokers to not supply the cast of Spike Lee's next film with
prime courtside real estate. Yet the most troubling of signs for
the home team were the complaints that this series was slipping
away on account of an offensive pace that, in New York, too often
looked like a match race between Sam Perkins and Rik Smits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you want to push the ball when you get the
opportunity,'' Van Gundy said. ``But how many easy baskets you get
stems from how you defend and how you rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Basketball, fellas, is basketball, and it wasn't until the
Pacers were about to be run and booed out of their own gym that
they reached down for something few people in the building thought
they had. They played defense like their playoff lives depended on
it. They were in a state of despair, losing 37-19 when Allan
Houston hit a 3 with 10:42 left in the first half. Then it was if
the script was torn up and tossed in the fire. The Knicks made one
more field goal the rest of the half. They lost the lead and went
off trailing 42-40, a 23-3 Indiana run.
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame Patrick Ewing for this one. Smits practically begged
for him to play and then Ewing proceeded to abuse him as the Knicks
staged a first-quarter clinic. Ewing was on the bench when the
Knicks' drought started, when the Pacers finally stopped worrying
about expectations and conspiracies and responded to the moment at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Holzman, coach of the only two Knick champions, was right _ the
game is about execution and effort, in half-court and full-court _
and in Game 5, the Pacers did it both ways. The championship
demands nothing less. From the second quarter on, the Pacers played
with purpose and resiliency. There was a point where they outscored
the Knicks 44-14. Their point guards, Mark Jackson and Travis Best,
played the second half with a vengeance. Jackson had a big third
quarter and did a little showboating, Larry Johnson-style, crossing
his arms, ``thanking God,'' each time he scored.
</P>
<P>
   L.J., incidentally, was the latest of the Knicks' game-time
decisions, showing up with a sore right foot. The Knicks' injury
reports are getting to be stranger than fiction. By Friday night,
Game 6, we may get one that says, ``Van Gundy, receding hairline,
may coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers didn't fall for the mind games, not this time. The
series was in their hands last Saturday in New York when Marcus
Camby went down with his sprained knee. They were overwhelmed with
the finals right in front of them. They spent the next seven
quarters playing as if they didn't believe another opportunity was
coming.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they settled into their defensive stances and created
one themselves, building a bridge back into the series, defensive
stop by stop, Knick brick by brick.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Pacers on this night stop obsessing on what the Knicks
were doing, how many of them were hurting, and just play like a
team worthy of the finals? Do they really believe they can beat the
Knicks? Hard to say, but the Pacers were as out on their feet in
the second quarter Wednesday night as the Knicks were Saturday in
New York. As the Knicks well know, cheating death can be carried a
long way.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Those low payment levels have already become a frustrating issue
among doctors, said Richard Hellman, a physician and president of
the Metropolitan Medical Society of Greater Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies have offered doctors as little as $7 per
month to take care of individual patients, Hellman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reached a point where doctors are not going to be able to
do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   - On most measures, the health of Kansas City residents was on a
par with that of residents of the other benchmark cities.
</P>
<P>
   A lower proportion of area residents had work disabilities
compared to the benchmark cities and to the United States
population overall.
</P>
<P>
   Rates of lung, prostate and colon cancer in Kansas City were
higher than in the other cities. And Kansas City had more deaths
from liver disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring problems the report found were enormous racial
and geographic disparities in the health of area residents.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Wyandotte and Jackson counties generally had the
most health problems, such as physical disabilities and
communicable diseases such as influenza, pneumonia and AIDS.
Johnson County residents experienced the fewest health problems.
</P>
<P>
   African-American residents of the Kansas City area were more
likely than whites to live in poverty, have low-birthweight babies,
contract sexually transmitted diseases, die at a relatively young
age, and die of chronic conditions such as heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's intolerable,'' said Kansas City Health Department
director Rex Archer, after hearing the report. ``This report will
help us deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford and the UAW have begun distributing copies of the
assessment on CD-ROM to members of the health-care community. And
they have set up a Kansas City office that will continue work on
the Health Care Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll meet with community leaders and groups who have
expressed interest. We'll hold forums, so priorities can be set by
the community, and not by us,'' said Cathy Davis, co-director of
the initiative. ``It's important that this be a community
initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitals and insurance companies did not provide data to
the initiative. And the initiative met with some skepticism from
some who heard the presentation of the report's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it goes anyplace new people aren't already
going,'' said E.J. Holland Jr., assistant vice president for
corporate benefits at Sprint. ``The major employers in town decided
10 years ago to work with...and collaborate with (health care)
providers.''
</P>
<P>
   But most who expressed opinions at the meeting gave the
initiative a glowing review:
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got gobs of competition in this community and precious
little cooperation. This offers the opportunity to cooperate,''
said Tom Bowser, chief operating officer of Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Metropolitan Medical Society is very supportive of this,''
Hellman said. ``Really, you're providing a service to the
community.''

HEALTH-CARE COSTS HIGHER IN KANSAS CITY, STUDY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Kansas City area has almost 1,000 more
hospital beds than it needs, area patients spend more time in the
hospital than patients in similar cities, and their health-care
costs appear to be high, a new report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Those were among the findings of a massive report assessing
health care in Kansas City. Commissioned by Ford Motor Co. and the
United Auto Workers union, the report was released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which garnered some skepticism but broad support
upon its release, is the first step in a long-range initiative by
the union and the auto company to improve the health of area
residents and the quality of the services they receive.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the UAW-Ford Community Health Care Initiative plan
meetings with community leaders in the fall to develop improvement
projects, using the report's findings to set priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is part of a 6-year-old industrywide effort by
the UAW and auto manufacturers to lower health-care costs in cities
with large auto factories by improving health care.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has 8,600 employees and retirees in the Kansas City area.
The company's Claycomo, Mo., plant produces the F-150 pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative also is supported by General Motors, which has
8,500 employees and retirees in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The auto companies spend a tremendous amount on health care.
It's a big part of the compensation package,'' said Bob Alpert,
executive director of the UAW's Center for Community Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to improving the cost-effectiveness of these programs
is looking at quality of care. If you improve health status, you
decrease disability. That gives a bottom-line improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is the sixth city with a union-industry health-care
initiative, and the first sponsored by Ford. The other cities with
initiatives involving either General Motors or DaimlerChrysler are
Flint, Mich.; Anderson and Kokomo, Ind.; the Warren-Youngstown area
of Ohio; and Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives already have led to a number of projects to
improve care:
</P>
<P>
   - In Anderson, two asthma clinics have been set up to help
patients care for themselves. They have succeeded in reducing
hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   - In Youngstown, a community effort to signed up children for
the federally funded Children's Health Insurance Program.
</P>
<P>
   - And in Flint, hospitals have been collaborating to create
centers of excellence for specialized services to avoid costly
duplication. That meant one hospital closed its heart surgery
program to let another hospital concentrate on those procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound Polyannaish, but there is evidence that
this (initiative process) works,'' said Raymond Baxter, executive
vice president of the Lewin Group. The Fairfax, Va.-based health
services consulting firm has advised the union and auto industry on
the initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In each city, the initiative started with an assessment of the
health of area residents and the cost and quality of local
health-care services.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City area Community Assessment Factbook, compiled by
the Lewin Group, took two years to complete and fills more than 700
pages.
</P>
<P>
   The report covers Clay, Platte and Jackson counties in Missouri
and Wyandotte and Johnson counties in Kansas. It uses data from a
variety of industry and government sources. And it draws
comparisons between the Kansas City area and several other similar
benchmark cities: Wichita, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Minneapolis-St.
Paul and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Among its key findings, presented Wednesday at a meeting with
community and health-care leaders:
</P>
<P>
   - Hospitals in Clay, Platte and Jackson counties had 618 more
beds than they needed to maintain optimum occupancy levels;
hospitals in Johnson and Wyandotte counties had 345 excess beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a more than ample supply of hospital beds, and if use
were the same as in other (benchmark) communities, that surplus
would be even greater,'' Baxter said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of excess beds would be as much as twice as high if
Kansas City patients had hospital stays as short as those of
patients in the benchmark cities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The average length of stay of a hospital patient in Kansas City
was 5.6 days, compared to 4.9 days in St. Louis and 4.2 days in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital stays also cost more in the Kansas City area than
elsewhere. On average, commercial insurance companies paid $6,135
per hospital admission in the area. That was 55 percent more than
the $3,970 average payment nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Corinne Everson, spokeswoman for St. Luke's Hospital, one of the
region's largest, said she had not had time to review the report,
but suggested its statistics be compared to those from other
sources, such as government Medicare data, and not used alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always encourage the public and employers to not rely on
one source of information, but to get multiple sources of data,''
Everson said.
</P>
<P>
   - The Kansas City area has about 4,600 physicians, more for its
population than other benchmark cities.
</P>
<P>
   But area residents who were privately insured didn't use
physician or other professional health services _ particularly
pathology, psychiatric and podiatry services _ as often as people
living in most of the benchmark cities.
</P>
<P>
   The exception: Kansas City area Medicare patients. They used
professional services at a higher rate than Medicare recipients in
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Private health insurance plans also paid health-care
professionals less for their services than the going rates in most
parts of the country. MORE

FINLEY GETS IT DONE AGAINST ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The uniform jersey was different, but the man and
the pitcher were all too familiar to the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley, who signed a three-year, $27 million contract with
the Cleveland Indians during the winter, pitched the way he had so
many times in his 14 seasons with the Angels. He wasn't spectacular
but found a way to get the job done, earning the victory in the
Indians' 7-3 win Wednesday night in front of 41,637 at Jacobs
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Finley gave up a two-run homer to Tim Salmon in the first inning
and was charged with an unearned run in the seventh. In all, he
went 62/3 innings and allowed three runs (two earned) and nine
hits, striking out eight and walking three.
</P>
<P>
   ``His game he threw tonight, we've been on the other side so
many times,'' Salmon said. ``It seemed so many times we'd start to
get a rally going and it stalls out. It was a typical Finley
performance. He teases you a little and shuts you down.''
</P>
<P>
   The start of the game was delayed 57 minutes by rain, making
Finley a bit antsy. But after Salmon's homer in the first, Finley
danced and darted his way out of potentially big Angels innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were hitting me pretty decent,'' said Finley (4-4). ``I
don't like to practice that, it's just the way I was born. God gave
easy games to someone else, I guess. ... Every inning, I looked
around and they had people on base. It was a battle for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a battle Finley won.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I came to Anaheim,'' said Mo Vaughn, who struck out
three times against Finley. ``I came here so I wouldn't have to
face him. That was the whole purpose of coming here. He threw as
well as I've ever seen him throw, even when I was in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon and Keith Luuloa had the most success against Finley,
each getting three hits. Salmon's fourth hit of the game came in
the ninth off Steve Karsay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird,'' Salmon said. ``From playing behind him, I felt
like I had a pretty good scouting report. But he's still got good
stuff. It's one thing to know what he's going to throw and another
thing to try to hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you face your old team you think they know how you pitch,
but you've got to stay with your strengths,'' Finley said. ``We
switched some (pitch) sequences around, pitched backwards, threw
more breaking balls. It was a chess game, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley earned his checkmate and sent his former teammates home
with their second consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at all the premier pitchers in the league, (Pedro)
Martinez, (Roger) Clemens and a guy like Finley,'' Angels manager
Mike Scioscia said. ``These guys very rarely get in trouble, but
when they do, they turn it up a notch to make pitches and get out
of it. That's a common denominator for any pitcher that's going to
be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into the game, the Angels were third in the American
League in runners left on base, and they were at it again
Wednesday. They left 14 runners on and went 1 for 10 with runners
in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   They had at least one hit in all nine innings, but never more
than two in any inning. They out-hit the Indians 14-10, but the
Indians made their hits count, getting a season-high five homers in
the game, including three in the decisive sixth inning. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ There was just under four minutes left when a
cruel punctuation to Patrick Ewing's return to the Knicks was about
to unfold. With his aching joints creaking like old floorboards,
with his bones as heavy as lead pipes, Ewing lumbered out too slow
and too late to reach Sam Perkins as he settled in to the left
corner of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers' braided old-timer had enough light to line up a
3-pointer that took the air out of the Knicks' plans to right their
miserable second-quarter collapse with a late comeback. As
Perkins's 3-pointer was swallowed by the net, the Pacers' 6-point
lead grew to 9, and the Knicks' resilience finally snapped.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers went on to win Game 5 of the Eastern Conference
finals, 88-79, on Wednesday night at Conseco Fieldhouse. They also
pushed the Knicks to the brink of elimination by taking a lead of
three games to two in this four-of-seven-game series. Game 6 will
be played on Friday night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the Knicks' performance only fed the
illusion that they are a better team without Ewing. At first
glance, it will look as if Latrell Sprewell (4 for 14) and Larry
Johnson (2 for 8), the heroes of Games 3 and 4 without Ewing, were
stifled by their center's presence. It will look as if the
perimeter-bound Allan Houston (25 points) was the only one who
could function with Ewing on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone will say we're 5-1 without Ewing,'' said Sprewell,
citing the Knicks' record against the Pacers over the last two
years when Ewing has been injured. ``That's not a fair thing to say
about Patrick. We hate to see it. It is what it is. But the bottom
line, he'll probably be playing in the next game, and we have to
get a win with him on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks started off in the right direction. It was Ewing's
dream return at first. He made his first three shots and sent the
Knicks off to an 18-point lead early in the second period only to
watch the team unravel during the rest of the nightmarish quarter.
The Knicks scored just 8 points, went 1 for 15 during the last 10
minutes and 42 seconds of the quarter and trailed by 42-40 after
the Pacers' 23-3 run. It was a horrendous stretch filled with lost
loose balls and a lack of composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made their run,'' said Ewing, who finished 5 for 10 from
the field with 13 points and 7 rebounds during 29 minutes of
playing time. ``We didn't regroup. You have to stay positive. You
have to keep on believing.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the many Knicks injuries _ Sprewell's foot,
Johnson's back, Ewing's foot _ are just too much for one team to
overcome?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask me that after the season,'' Ewing said. ``Ask me that
after we win the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing maintained his stubborn faith even after a second quarter
that rattled the Knicks and left them irreparably damaged _ if only
for a night. Instead of containing the Pacers, Chris Childs and
Charlie Ward let Travis Best (24 points) beat them off the dribble
and Mark Jackson (11 points, 7 assists) bludgeon them in the post.
Instead of closing off Reggie Miller (16 points), Houston gave him
open looks and let him slip by him on the baseline. Instead of
blocking out their man, the Ewing-anchored Knicks were
outrebounded, 45-43.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were outworked, out-hustled,'' Sprewell said. ``We didn't
have that extra something Indiana did.''
</P>
<P>
   In that fateful second quarter, the Pacers' effort showed on the
boards. With Marcus Camby (0 for 3, 4 rebounds) getting beaten to
the boards by players like Austin Croshere, Best and Derrick McKey,
the Knicks were outrebounded in the second quarter, 16-8. On one
play, Best hit a 3-pointer on a third chance after two misses by
Miller. The 3-point opportunities haunted the Knicks. They gave up
4 for 9 from 3-point range in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played an outstanding 12 to 14 minutes,'' Van Gundy said.
``After that, we didn't play like we're capable of playing. You can
characterize it by saying it was a little of good defense by them
and some bad offense by us. Being up 18, and then losing that lead,
you are still only behind by 2 points at the half.''
</P>
<P>
   But the damage had been done to the Knicks' psyche. They never
recovered the lead from there. Only Houston was able to make any
dents in the Pacers' ever-increasing lead. Almost each time Houston
came up with a jumper, there would be a breakdown on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't keep our intensity up,'' Sprewell said. `'We just
started going away from all the things that worked early.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost a week, Ewing watched his team win two playoff games
without him while listening to his critics argue how the Knicks
were better when he was seated on the bench. That was enough
motivation for Ewing on Wednesday night. But if he needed one more
incentive to push him through the pain during Game 5, he received
it from Jeff Van Gundy on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A blissfully unaware Rik Smits ambled into a hallway on
Wednesday only to find that an indignant Van Gundy had turned his
honest replies about playing against Ewing into a gauntlet for the
Knicks' aging and injured center. On Tuesday, Smits said he
preferred to play against Ewing because he felt the 37-year-old
center was easier to score on. Ewing played him from behind, while
Chris Dudley and Kurt Thomas fronted him and denied him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was Rik Smits, personally, I would not have said that,''
Van Gundy said before his team's shoot-around at Conseco
Fieldhouse. ``I've never heard anybody ask to play against Patrick.
This is a first for me. Not many guys ask to play against a
Hall-of-Famer at his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how Patrick will respond. I know one thing: he's
not usually motivated by external forces, but I've never seen
someone basically call him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing responded by humiliating Smits in the opening quarter, and
leading the Knicks to a 32-17 first-quarter lead. Then the Pacers,
with Smits on the bench and Travis Best guiding their way,
responded by embarrassing the Knicks right back. In one surreal
second quarter, the Pacers unleashed a frenzied rebounding effort,
pressured the Knicks into a four turnovers and made up an 18-point
deficit. With an overpowering 23-3 run, the Pacers grabbed an
amazing 42-40 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks stayed in the game, but came up short. ``It didn't
matter if Patrick was in or out of the game,'' Ward said. ``He was
there when we got a big lead. It's only one game. They're up 3-2.
We can't let this zap our intensity or our emotions.'' &QL;

   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INDIANAPOLIS _ The Pacers do it so often you have to figure it's
part of the game plan. The ``Gasoline Rally,'' that is.
</P>
<P>
   You know the routine _ fall behind by double digits and then
stage a remarkable comeback. Sometimes they manage to pull it off,
sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the Pacers pulled it off.
</P>
<P>
   Rallying from an 18-point first-half deficit, the Pacers downed
the Knicks 88-79 in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, which
was played before 18,345 in Conseco Fieldhouse and thousands more
who were milling about outside, straining to catch glimpses of the
action on video screens.
</P>
<P>
   So the series not even the Amazing Kreskin could predict will
resume Friday at Madison Square Garden with the Pacers leading 3-2,
just one victory away from advancing to the NBA Finals for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Even for the Knicks and the Pacers, Wednesday's game represented
a milestone of unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous two games, played at Madison Square Garden, the
Pacers quickly fell behind by huge margins. Of course they rallied,
coming back from a 13-point deficit to lose Game 3 by three points
and then rallying from 17 points down in Game 4, only to come up
just two short.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Bird addressed his team's poor starts, hoping to
avoid the first-quarter blues the Pacers had endured in New York.
So, of course, they promptly went out and fell behind by 15 points
in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   And just like the previous two games, the Pacers rallied.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was that this time they succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they didn't put their heads between their legs and
worry about how the crowd was reacting (after their poor start),''
Bird said of the Pacers' horrible start. ``I really believe that
the guys had it in their minds that they were going to give a full
48-minute effort, and they did that.''
</P>
<P>
   And this came against a Knicks team that was at full strength _
or at least what amounts to full strength for them.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, who had missed the previous two games with a foot
injury, was back on the floor. Larry Johnson, who was allegedly
suffering from plantar fasciitis in his right foot, an injury
suffered in the final minutes of Game 4, also played. Latrell
Sprewell refused to let a broken bone in his left foot keep him off
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, the Knicks played miserably after a superb start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at halftime, after being up 18 and losing the lead, still
you're only minus-two on the road at that point,'' said Knicks
coach Jeff Van Gundy. ``But we have to try to put that (the Pacers'
rally) aside and come out and play a strong second half and find a
way to win. And we didn't get that done.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can't be any carryover or hangover effect (for Game 6).
If there is, we're going to be in a hole to start Game 6, and we
can't afford to be in a hole. We have to learn from this, move on
and play one great home game to try and force a deciding game
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis Best led the Pacers with a playoff career-high 24 points,
outdueling New York's Allan Houston, who was one of the few Knicks
to play well in this game, finishing with 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to be aggressive,'' Best said. ``I didn't
think they could check me. I was feeling good, and I was able to
stay in the game. I thought that the two games in New York (where
he had 21 points total) I got in foul trouble and had some calls go
against me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, with the fans here and in a game that was so important,
I just wanted to come out and put up some shots. Things worked out
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose added 18 points and Reggie Miller 16, while Derrick
McKey grabbed nine rebounds and played strong defense, especially
on Johnson, who finished with four points and four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell played like someone trying to gut out a broken foot,
scoring 10 points while making only four of his 14 shots. Ewing
played like a guy with two (broken) left feet, scoring 13 points _
but only four after the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised to hear the anti-Ewing sentiment again.
Against the Pacers in the conference finals the last two years, the
Knicks are 5-1 without Ewing and 1-5 with him.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pacers led by only two points at halftime, the Knicks
looked like a defeated team.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind by 18 in the opening minutes of the second
period, the Pacers used a Twilight Zone-worthy second quarter to
rally, deflating the Knicks in the process.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 32 points and shooting 63 percent from the floor
in the first period, the Knicks wound up with just eight points in
the second, making only two of 16 field-goal attempts (13 percent),
and the Pacers were more than willing to take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, which was behind by double digits for much of the first
half, still trailed by 11 points with four minutes to play in the
half when Marcus Camby hit a free throw.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana then put together a 13-0 run to close the period, with
four Pacers scoring, to take a 42-40 lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't worry about the ups and downs and the emotional joy
ride,'' Rose said of the Pacers' propensity for poor starts. ``We
know that we have what it takes to come back. We just have to stay
in there mentally and get the job done.''

   DRUG-PRICES _ More and more in recent years, private insurance
has been picking up the cost of prescription medicine. Only about
one-quarter of the total drug costs of Americans are now paid out
of pocket. That explains why there is no general political uproar,
even though drug prices in the United States have been rising by as
much as 15 percent a year, the pharmaceutical manufacturers are
among the most profitable businesses in the world and many new
drugs in Canada and Europe cost a fraction of what they do here.
Imagine the political swivet Americans would be in if that were the
case with gasoline or some other staple of daily life. The elderly,
of course, are up in arms. Those who are completely dependent on
Medicare, which does not cover the cost of outpatient
prescriptions, bear the brunt of the skyrocketing prices. But most
Americans never face these high drug prices. They pay no more than
$5 or $10 for each prescription. By David E. Rosenbaum. (1400

FAMILY, FRIENDS MOURN WOMAN WITH PROMISING FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG GITTRICH AND LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lori Gonzalez's family and friends mourned the
slain 20-year-old Tuesday, describing her as a young woman with a
promising future who taught Bible study classes for children.
</P>
<P>
   Bright, attractive, hard-working and caring, Gonzalez, the
granddaughter of Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, had left her
community college in Mission Viejo just a few weeks ago to visit
her parents and friends in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, she was killed at a Popeyes Chicken
drive-through restaurant in the Jefferson Park area of South Los
Angeles by bullets police said were intended for a man described as
an acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   Family members and friends said Gonzalez chose her friends
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating. Everyone's in shock. I think everybody can't
believe this has happened,'' said the Rev. Eric Nachtrieb,
Gonzalez's pastor and a spokesman for her grieving family.
</P>
<P>
   She had three semesters behind her at Saddleback College. In
recent weeks, she was training for an entry-level job at Pacific
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Nachtrieb called Gonzalez ``one of the key leaders'' of a
ministry serving children at Coast Hills Community Church in Aliso
Viejo. She regularly attended church with her father, Joe, and her
stepmother, Debbie. Each Sunday morning, she taught a group of
about 15 children, reading them Bible stories, leading them in
group singing, and introducing them to religious crafts.
</P>
<P>
   She also participated in mission trips to Mexico, where she and
other church members would build homes for disadvantaged children,
her pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very warm, loving and friendly,'' he said. ``It was
not uncommon to see her on the floor with a couple kids in her lap.
She was very faithful with the kids and they loved her.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, Gonzalez had lived with her father in Mission
Viejo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really sad to hear what happened. It really hit me this
morning,'' said Goy Casillas, vice principal of Redondo Union High
School, where Gonzalez graduated in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very bright, genuine young lady who worked hard. She
was attractive and had a very nice, open personality. She was a
person who you could make friends with very easily,'' Casillas
recalled without a pause.
</P>
<P>
   When Gonzalez attended the Redondo Beach high school, she lived
mostly with her mother in the beachside community south of Los
Angeles. But about two months before she was set to graduate, she
moved down to Mission Viejo to be with her father. Her parents have
been divorced for 18 years and shared custody of their daughter,
family friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She moved, but she really wanted to graduate from Redondo,''
Casillas said. And she did.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators from the two schools allowed Gonzalez to finish
her Redondo Union classes in Mission Viejo. At the end of the year,
she returned to Redondo Beach and walked in the graduation line
with her friends and former classmates, Casillas said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Gonzalez from high school - including teachers,

WHAT TO DO WITH SHAW?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone wouldn't rule
out closer Jeff Shaw being put on the disabled list, but it's not
in the immediate plans. For now, manager Davey Johnson will use a
bullpen by committee in tight situations while Shaw sits.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw has blown 5 of 16 save opportunities, opponents are hitting
.316 against him and his ERA is a robust 7.84 in 22 appearances, so
Johnson said he's going to ease off him. Shaw is experiencing
weakness in the back of his pitching (right) shoulder, and Johnson
said he'll rest him for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I was going to stay off him and let him regroup a
little bit,'' Johnson said. ``He's doing some exercises. There's no
question he has some weakness there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with him in it's not like he's been getting totally
hammered. It's ground-ball base hits, but he's not throwing it like
he's been capable of throwing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who is owed $5 million this season and $6 million in 2001,
said he doesn't feel like his fastball has its usual zip and his
slider is flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week it felt like I was throwing the ball 80 miles per
hour,'' Shaw said. ``The radar gun still said 91, 92, but I don't
feel like the ball is exploding out of my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he'll rely on his stable of former closers while
Shaw regains his health, which the Dodgers hope leads to him
regaining his form. Mike Fetters, Terry Adams and Antonio Osuna,
depending on the situation, will each be asked to pick up the
slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through (a bullpen by committee) the last five years
in Chicago, but as long as Jeff Shaw is on this ballclub, he's the
closer,'' said Adams, who saved 13 games for the Cubs last season.
``We all go through streaks when we struggle. Like any pitcher, any
kind of ache is going to cause you difficulty. But we have enough
arms down there that somebody can pick somebody up and give (Shaw)
a break.''
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ, DODGERS AGREE: The Dodgers and Carlos Perez reached
agreement on an extension in which the left-hander waived his right
to decline a minor-league assignment despite having five years of
major-league service time.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's representatives, Adam Katz and Tom Reich, met with
Dodgers officials again Wednesday and reached an agreement that is
believed to be similar to the one he signed in late April, though
it wasn't made public until May 1. At that time, it was a 45-day
window in which Perez said he would waive his right to decline an
assignment. That window closed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers were seeking another 45-day agreement, Perez's
representatives held out to lessen the deal, and the Dodgers are
believed to have come down substantially from that. It's also the
last such deal that will be worked out, a person familiar with the
process said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos wanted to make sure that if he continued doing what
he's doing, he wouldn't be sent down,'' a source said. ``This
agreement takes care of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez is 4-2 with a 5.40 ERA, and he's pitched well in seven of
his nine starts. The Dodgers plan to use Perez cautiously, starting
him against teams he matches up well against.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of tough when you do it for a second time,'' Perez
said. ``We are doing this because (the Dodgers) wanted to do
something. I guess I have to keep doing what I'm doing, just
pitching good.''
</P>
<P>
   If Perez didn't agree to an extension, the Dodgers were prepared
to send him to the minors before Wednesday's game. But that also
could have brought a litany of problems, including a grievance from
the players association.
</P>
<P>
   LODUCA TO ARRIVE: Even before the injury to Todd Hundley, the
Dodgers planned to recall infielder Alex Cora and return
switch-hitting catcher Adam Melhuse to Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   However, with Hundley going on the 15-day disabled list with a
strained oblique muscle, plans have changed. Melhuse is still
expected to be sent back to Albuquerque before Friday's game at
Anaheim, but catcher Paul LoDuca is expected to join the club.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this season, catching prospect Angel Pena is
down with a hip flexor injury, so LoDuca gets the call. He's
hitting .299 with no homers and 22 RBI in 41 games with the Dukes. &QL;

DEFENSE KEY TO SPARKS' VICTORY OVER UTAH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ They talked defense, practiced defense emphasized
defense in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was the first regular-season test, and the Sparks
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a short letup, the Sparks were able to hold off the Utah
Starzz's late charge and finish with a 69-62 victory in front of
6,112 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our defense was spectacular for 40 minutes,'' said
Michael Cooper, who got his first win as coach. ``If this team
plays up to its ability, you're looking at the next WNBA
champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that their offense was much better, but the Sparks limited
the Starzz to 34 percent from the field, had 13 steals and forced
20 turnovers. The Sparks, who shot 33 percent from the field, shot
80 percent (20 of 25) from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Mwadi Mabika had a game-high 21 points. DeLisha Milton, in foul
trouble much of the game, finished with 11 points and five
rebounds. Lisa Leslie, who fouled out with less than a minute to
play, had 11 rebounds and became the league's all-time leading
rebounder with 810. Her eight points also put past 1,500 and into
third all-time behind Houston's Cynthia Cooper and Phoenix's
Jennifer Gillom.
</P>
<P>
   Utah resurfaced behind UCLA alum Natalie Williams and made a
late charge. She scored seven points in a 9-0 run that cut the
Sparks lead to 64-61.
</P>
<P>
   The Starzz' 7-foot-2 Margo Dydek tried to make it a one-point
game when she attempted a 3-pointer from the top of the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can shoot that shot,'' Utah coach Fred Williams said.
``She won two ballgames for us last year with that shot. Those are
good looks for her. She has a good percentage from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ukari Figgs, who missed two crucial free throws, got a chance to
redeem herself when she made two free throws with 20 seconds to
play as the Sparks went up 68-62.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks got through much of the first half without Milton,
who picked up her third foul with 15 minutes remaining in the
second half. But the Sparks had enough depth on the bench. Cooper
went 11 deep.
</P>
<P>
   Mabika led the Sparks with 12 points as they took a 35-34
advantage into the break.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had 21 points and 14 rebounds, and Adrienne Goodson had
14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Utah coach Williams, who coached at USC, said the Sparks'
defense was a big factor in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did take away a lot of our looks,'' Williams said. ``They
pressured our wings. That what the Sparks do. I thought we played
very hard, we picked our defense up in the second half. We hung in
there.'' &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ If the Astros were a college football team, they would be
the most sought-after homecoming opponent in the nation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alas, they are a major-league baseball team, regardless of how
infrequently they have resembled one this season. Stop if you've
heard this before, but the Astros jumped out to an early lead
Wednesday night, only to watch it disappear in an 8-6 loss to the
Colorado Rockies at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Berkman's seventh-inning two-run homer tied the score and
gave the Astros new life, but the joy was short-lived. Jeffrey
Hammonds put the Rockies on top for good with a massive two-run
homer to straightaway center field off a 98-mph fastball thrown by
Billy Wagner in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right down the middle,'' said Wagner, who has allowed
12 earned runs in his last 10 innings. ``If he misses that one,
he's kicking himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' road losing streak reached nine games, the longest
such skid since the club lost 12 in a row on the road in 1996. They
have lost 12 of their last 16 games overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be long before this thing is going to turn
around, and we're going to be jumping all over these teams that are
jumping all over us,'' Wagner said. ``Teams should be wanting to
play us right now. They don't even have to beat us; we're finding
ways to beat ourselves. But we're going to get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing to test the theories of Murphy's Law, the Astros
discovered yet another thing that could go wrong Wednesday, giving
the Rockies two earned runs that were indirectly the result of
Berkman's losing a ball in the lights in the third inning. A catch
would have been the third out of the inning; the next batter,
Darren Bragg, hit a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beat goes on,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``If we
don't beat ourselves, some sort of quirky thing beats us. We're not
playing in a lot of good fortune right now. We're not playing well,
and a part of it is that we've had no luck. It's a recurring theme,
and it's not a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   The fluky play in the outfield marred another fine night at the
plate for Berkman, who was 3-for-4 with a career-high-tying four
RBIs for the second game in a row. Berkman continues to be one of
the Astros' biggest run producers over the past week, having
tallied 13 RBIs in six games since being recalled from the minors
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get too high about my hitting, because it doesn't
amount to much in a loss,'' Berkman said. ``I'm swinging the bat
pretty well right now, but there are some other things that I did
that hurt us. I had a baserunning mistake (in the third inning),
and I lost that ball in the lights, and the guy ends up hitting a
double.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' record dropped to 19-33, third-worst in the majors
ahead of Philadelphia and Tampa Bay. They remained in last place in
the National League Central, which they have won each of the past
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had told me the Astros were going to be a last-place
team, I would have said, `That's unbelievable,''' said Astros
starter Jose Lima, who hasn't won a decision since April 5 _ his
first start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's game came down to the final innings, but it didn't
appear headed that way from the beginning. The Astros led 4-0 after
2{ innings, but the Rockies tied the score with four runs in the
bottom of the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, if we score four runs that early, it's a done
deal,'' Lima said. ``But for some reason, nothing is going our
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima, who is hardly the Astros' best-hitting pitcher, helped
himself simply by putting the ball in play in the second inning.
His bases-loaded fielder's-choice grounder drove home the Astros'
first run. It was Lima's first RBI of the season, and it came in
his 18th at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros added three more runs in the third inning, courtesy
of a pair of players who began the season at Class AAA New Orleans.
Berkman, after falling behind 0-2 in the count, drove home two runs
with a single up the middle, and Julio Lugo added an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies' four-run third inning included Jeff Cirillo's
two-out, two-run homer and Bragg's two-run double. However, Bragg
never would have batted if Berkman hadn't lost Hammonds' fly ball
in the lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see that ball for the last 10 feet,'' Berkman said.
``It was freakish.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo doubled home another run in the fifth, and Mike
Lansing's solo homer in the sixth pushed the Rockies' lead to 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Lima didn't make it out of the sixth inning, marking the sixth
time he has failed to complete six innings in his last eight
starts. He failed to complete six innings in just five of his 35
starts last season.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies starter Masato Yoshii didn't appear to be long for
Wednesday's game after the Astros ripped him for four runs on 10
hits through the first three innings. But he settled down and
retired 10 of the last 12 batters he faced, allowing just two more
hits in his 6-inning performance. The 12 hits allowed established a
career high for Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   Berkman atoned for his error with a towering two-run homer off
righthanded reliever Stan Belinda that tied the score in the
seventh inning. Berkman has hit four home runs in his last five
games, and the Astros have hit at least one homer in a club-record
18 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Berkman was upstaged by Hammonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that situation, if he gets me with a slider, all you can do
is tip your cap,'' Hammonds said of his confrontation with Wagner.
``I was just looking dead red. I got a pitch to hit. Getting a
pitch to hit and hitting it are two different things. Two weeks
ago, I wouldn't have hit it.''

L.A. MAYOR AGAINST FEDERAL CONSENT DECREE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - Mayor Richard Riordan has come out against any
effort to impose a federal consent decree on the Los Angeles Police
Department or even the appointment of a monitor to oversee the
troubled agency.
</P>
<P>
   In his strongest language to date, Riordan offered a hearty
endorsement of Police Chief Bernard C. Parks and said the
department can clean itself up with federal help but no permanent
control of the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is they (federal officials) agree that Chief
Parks is doing a good job in cleaning up the mess,'' Riordan said
Wednesday during his monthly ``Ask the Mayor'' show on radio
station KFWB-AM (980). ``The problem is, in talking to a lot of
people at the Department of Justice we're not sure where they're
coming from or where they want to get.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the civilian Police Commission and the Inspector
General's Office, all of whom have the same goal of cleaning up the
LAPD and make it even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to have them sue us. We don't need to have a
consent decree. We don't need to have them monitor us. We are
willing to seek their advice and make this a better department,''
Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's assertion went beyond his earlier statements after a
federal threat last month to sue Los Angeles unless the city enters
a court-supervised agreement, known as a consent decree, to place
LAPD reform in the hands of a court-appointed monitor.
</P>
<P>
   On May 9, for example, Riordan argued local leaders should
continue to control LAPD reform but he declined to take a stand on
a consent decree and refused to say whether he would oppose federal
control if it meant avoiding a civil rights lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's latest remarks came as city officials are scheduled
to meet Thursday with officials from the Justice Department's civil
rights division in negotiations over whether a consent decree will
be sought.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's top aide, Deputy Mayor Kelly Martin, is his
representative on the city team headed by City Attorney James Hahn
and includes Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton and LAPD
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's remarks Wednesday angered Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas, who has been involved in issues concerning the
Police Department since before his election in 1993. Previously,
Ridley-Thomas headed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the mayor makes remarks like that, you can tell he is not
committed to police reform,'' said Ridley-Thomas, who was among a
number of city officials who welcomed the Justice Department's
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree we want the best Police Department -- but the
best Police Department for the public, and not the best Police
Department for the police,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in his radio remarks, Riordan insisted Parks can make the
changes necessary because of his own high standards and tough
disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie Parks has fired more officers in two years for
misconduct than were fired for the 15 years before him,'' Riordan
said. ``He does not tolerate deviant behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, I agree that what happened at the Rampart Division was
wrong, but we can't allow the Police Department to be demoralized.
Crime has gone down for seven straight years,'' Riordan said.

TYPICAL PHONE BILL TO FALL IN JULY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Families and some businesses will save money on
their phone bills next month under the restructured long-distance
rate plan announced by the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.2 billion cost-saving plan, called the largest rate cut
in the history of federal telephone regulation, should have the
biggest impact on the poor and those who use their phones the
least. Rates would be reduced by as much as 50 percent for
Americans who make few or no long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers and businesses that make more long-distance calls,
the government predicted reduced costs, although some consumer
groups and Wall Street analysts disagreed with the government's
estimates, suggesting they were too rosy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in announcing the agreement with phone companies
Wednesday, the FCC released an analysis indicating the savings
might not last long and overall charges might actually be higher
within two years.
</P>
<P>
   The plan eliminates $3.2 billion in access charges paid by
long-distance companies to local phone companies. Customers are now
billed for these fees, which are referred to as pass-through
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``These charges, no matter if you make calls or not, still
appear on your bill,'' said Linda Sherry, editorial director for
Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in July, customers will be charged less for
long-distance access and might find lower per-minute costs as well.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is a modified version of a proposal submitted by the
Coalition for Affordable Local and Long Distance Service, an
industry group made up of representatives from AT&AMP;T, Bell Atlantic,
BellSouth, GTE, SBC Communications and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions of the plan include the elimination of the
presubscribed interexchange carrier charge -- PICC on phone bills
-- which has cost consumers $1.50 per month. The charge was
scheduled to increase to $2 per line in July, said Matt Miller,
spokesman for SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the charge will be eliminated and partly rolled into
the subscriber line charge, now $3.50 per month. After the change,
the fee will be $4.50, instead of two fees of $3.50 and $2, Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PICC is going to disappear,'' Miller said. ``We're going
to stop charging that to long-distance companies, and in turn
they're going to stop charging it to their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the per-minute fee that long-distance carriers pay
to local phone companies will be reduced to less than 1 cent per
minute -- 0.55 of a cent -- from an average of 1.5 cents for
Pacific Bell customers.
</P>
<P>
   While the new rules will lower the fees at first, the FCC
projects higher bills for consumers in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   FCC analysts say an average residential customer would have paid
$7.62 in monthly fees for July 2000 under the old rules. The same
customer will pay $6.79 in fees under the new plan.
</P>
<P>
   But in July 2002, that same customer will pay an estimated $7.68
in monthly fees under the new plan, while that customer would have
paid $7.42 under the current rate structure.
</P>
<P>
   And in July 2004, the average customer will pay $7.75 in fees
under the new plan instead of $6.85 in fees if the current rules
had been left in place.
</P>
<P>
   The projected increases probably reflect a scheduled rise in the
subscriber line charge from its initial $4.35 to $6.50 in 2003,
Miller said. The increase must be approved before it takes effect,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before it rises, the FCC must do a cost-showing -- to show
that the rise is necessary,'' Miller said. ``Remember, $3.2 billion
is coming out of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional provision of the agreement is that Sprint and AT&AMP;T
have agreed to eliminate the $3 monthly charge levied on all
long-distance customers who do not make a monthly minimum of calls.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom, which was not part of the coalition, also
eliminated its monthly minimum charge, spokeswoman Julie Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worldcom supports the pro-consumer goals of the plan,'' Moore
said. ``In the past, whenever we received any reductions in access
charges, we have passed them along to our customers.''

<P>
   Darn. I would have loved to ask him what his favorite color is,
just like the other media members.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the ESPN interview Tuesday with Roy Firestone and Digger
Phelps, seven print-reporter colleagues were hand-picked by Knight
for a Q-and-A session the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's answers to them, based on their published stories, were
generally similar to what he told ESPN. Which, if I may be so bold
as to summarize, was something like this:
</P>
<P>
   (START ITAL) So I lost my temper a couple times. So have you.
Here's a blanket apology for anyone sissy enough to be offended.
Now watch me prove you wrong, just like I have done to everyone
every single day of my superior life. (END ITAL).
</P>
<P>
   The print-reporter session did elicit one intriguing answer,
published in the Washington Post. Asked if he wished that the
school's president or trustees had taken action against him years
ago, Knight replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wish that. But if that should have happened, then it
should have happened five years ago or 10 years ago or 15 years
ago, if that in fact was the case. If there was a feeling whenever,
then sit me down and tell me. I don't have any problems with
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've made a mistake, then somebody needs to say something
to me at that point. If I continue to make the mistake, that's no
longer anybody's fault but mine ... I think it's a matter of
saying, `Here's what I don't want. Here's what I want. And now
let's do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Well, jeez. The man is right. Unless somebody sat down and told
him, how else was he to know that throwing a chair across a
basketball floor in protest of a call was wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Unless somebody else called it to his attention, how else would
he have known that fighting with his athletic director last
February was a violation of standard employer-employee protocols?
</P>
<P>
   Calling an athletic-department secretary a ``f---ing bitch,''
and knocking out the sports-information director? Really, now, how
could anyone know these things are considered impolite unless one
has read a book of guidelines?
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, we are just learning that Knight is a
lonely soul cast adrift, just waiting for a guiding hand who could
help him distinguish between right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's victimhood is mindful of the old Steve Martin routine:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is murder illegal? I ... forgot!''
</P>
<P>
   While explaining right from wrong is a task far too formidable
for a simple media hack _ not to mention hopeless, since most of
Knight's earthly disconnects have come when someone has had the
temerity to suggest he was in error _ it is possible to offer up
some questions that might give Knight help in his quest for truth,
justice and the Indiana way.
</P>
<P>
   Such as:
</P>
<P>
   --After you popped the cop in Puerto Rico in 1979, did you
explain to your players that, while they should never do that,
remember that above all you're an American, so local rules do not
apply?
</P>
<P>
   --When you chewed out Indiana's cheerleaders for cheering and
distracting one of your players, did you also demonstrate your
sportsmanship by chewing them out for distracting the opponent?
</P>
<P>
   --When you screamed at and kicked your own son during a game,
causing the Indiana crowd to boo you, should they have known better
and cheered?
</P>
<P>
   --Speaking of your son, how did his nose get in your way on that
hunting trip?
</P>
<P>
   --You said on national TV that if rape is inevitable, one should
relax and enjoy it, but would you stick to the recommendation if
the various assault claims against you turned into convictions and
you served time in prison?
</P>
<P>
   --When a hand is tightly wrapped around another's throat, when
is it not a choke hold?
</P>
<P>
   --While you credit your wife for her cautionary signs around the
house, ``The horse is dead _ get off it,'' who gets credit for
killing the horse?
</P>
<P>
   --When you persist in behavior that your wives, bosses, closest
friends and basketball colleagues have claimed embarrasses you and
the university and undercuts the worthwhile values you convey, what
snappily sarcastic retort renders moot their contentions?
</P>
<P>
   --Are you a bully? And if you say you aren't, does that make you
a liar?
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, Knight has clever answers for all these questions.
He had clever answers Tuesday, as he has had his 29 years at
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder he's supremely arrogant about his ability to flick
away this latest lint attack against his big red sweater.
</P>
<P>
   If he's never been held accountable up to now, nothing in his
experience tells him he can't talk _ and win _ his way around even
a ``zero-tolerance'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   Just give him some guidelines.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PORTLAND, Ore. _ Throughout the WNBA exhibition season, one
established franchise after another stepped forward boasting of
intentions to dethrone the three-time defending champion Comets in
2000.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one asked Linda Hargrove if she thought her expansion
Portland Fire would fit in among Sacramento, Phoenix and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, in a franchise-first WNBA encounter, the Fire
carried the Comets to double overtime and then came face to face
with Sheryl Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   End of story. Swoopes collected a huge steal and fast-break
basket with 12.6 seconds left and had four of the five Houston
baskets in the second extra period as the Comets survived 93-89 at
the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes, in her second consecutive outstanding outing, led all
scorers with 29 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take anything away from them; they are a very good
team,'' Swoopes said of the Fire. ``We said at halftime (with
Portland leading 38-34) that we were playing like the expansion
team and they were playing like the champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the good thing about our team is that regardless of how
many overtimes it went to, we were never going to give up. Win,
lose or draw, we were going to give it our all and at least say we
left it all out on the court. It wasn't a pretty win, but it was a
`W.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although a little off in her shooting (12-for-27 overall,
0-for-3 on 3-pointers), Swoopes was 5-of-6 from the free-throw line
and had seven rebounds, six assists, six steals and one huge
overtime outburst.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting was one of the sore spots all night for the Comets, who
hit just 33 of 82 shots from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   That and interior defense. With Fire starting center Sylvia
Crawley in foul trouble, Alisa Burras came off the bench and raided
the Comets for 19 points, tying Sophia Witherspoon for a team high,
and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Crawley had only four points at the end of regulation but got 10
more over the two five-minute extra periods to finish with 14.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper struggled to 22 points for the Comets, while Tina
Thompson got 17 points and Janeth Arcain 18.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper missed 10 of her first 11 field-goal attempts, finishing
6-of-23. Swoopes also was experiencing a poor night shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire, meanwhile, led by as many as seven points (35-28) and
took a 38-34 lead into halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Only the offense of Thompson, who got 11 of her 17 points, kept
the Comets close.
</P>
<P>
   There were five ties over the final 4:16 of regulation. A layup
by Tully Bevilaqua netted a 73-73 tie and set up the first OT.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes and Cooper got two baskets each in the OT, a layup by
Cooper with 6.6 seconds left pulling the Comets even at 81-81.
</P>
<P>
   In the second overtime, Swoopes took charge. A Crawley follow
shot had given Portland the edge 83-81. But Swoopes swished a
jumper from the free-throw line to tie. She had an athletic layup
under the arm of Stacey Thomas to put the Comets up 85-83. But
Crawley connected from the top of the key to again bring about a
tie.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes interrupted her scoring frenzy long enough to allow
Tiffani Johnson to get her only basket of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Then the 6-foot Swoopes stole a pass from Burras and raced the
length of the floor for a layup that gave the Comets a 91-87 lead
with 12.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be frank,'' said Comets coach Van Chancellor. ``I
thought they (the Fire) would be tough, but I didn't expect them to
carry us to two overtimes.''

LITTON PROFITS, ORDERS SHOW GROWTH SPURT

<P>
   WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. _ Litton Industries has reported a 21
percent jump in per-share earnings for the third quarter and said
its Avondale ship building unit received a $477 million Navy
contract for a new warship.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter that ended April 30, the big defense and
information technology contractor earned $61.8 million, or $1.33
per share, on revenues of $1.4 billion. This compares with net
income of $50.9 million, or $1.10 per share, on revenues of $1.26
billion for the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Reported income for the 2000 quarter excludes a one-time gain
that Woodland Hills-based Litton received on the sale of some
business units. Including these profits boosts per-share earnings
to $1.35, or a gain of 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Litton's third-quarter results met our expectations and
demonstrated double-digit growth in revenue, net income and
earnings per share. We are encouraged by our record backlog and
solid performances in our core businesses,'' said Michael R. Brown,
Litton's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Litton bought a competitor, Avondale Industries, and
is now the nation's biggest builder of nonnuclear ships for the
U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
   That business got a boost Wednesday as the company announced it
received the contract for the third of as many as eight amphibious
assault ships.
</P>
<P>
   The government plans on a 12-ship fleet, with the remaining four
being built by Bath Iron Works of Bath, Maine.

HAWKS IN BIDDING FOR YOUNG, BUT SITUATION REMAINS CLOUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Steve Young will announce soon that he is
retiring. No, wait _ the highest-rated passer in NFL history will
return to the San Francisco 49ers. No, that's not it _ Young will
be released by the 49ers and sign with the Denver Broncos. Or will
it be the Seahawks?
</P>
<P>
   The entire football world, it seems, is awaiting Young's
decision _ which he has been pondering for the past 2{ months, when
he also took an extended honeymoon with his wife, Barbara, who is
pregnant with their first child.
</P>
<P>
   Young was expected to announce his verdict Friday, but was
granted an extension until June 10 after a meeting on Tuesday night
with 49ers coach Steve Mariucci. June 3 had loomed as D-day,
because Young was due a $1 million bonus if still on the roster.
The club granted Young the extra time after he signed a waiver on
receiving the bonus.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows what Young will do _ not even Young,
apparently. Everyone, however, seems to have an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another day, another rumor,'' one NFC general manager offered
Wednesday. ``Just when you think you've heard it all, another Steve
Young story pops up.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate future of the future Hall of Famer has been in
limbo since Sept. 27, when Young received his fourth concussion in
the past three years during the 49ers' game against the Arizona
Cardinals. Young blacked out momentarily and later had
post-concussion symptoms that included dizziness, vomiting and
slurred speech.
</P>
<P>
   So what should Young do? What (BEGIN ITAL) will (END ITAL) he
do?
</P>
<P>
   Young's precarious situation is the latest example of sports
spilling over into the reality of life _ or vice versa. He has
undergone every conceivable test, but even the 49ers want Young to
be cleared by more doctors before letting him back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the opinions and rumors circulating Wednesday,
and the facts behind them:
</P>
<P>
   Opinion: The San Francisco Examiner published an editorial
Wednesday urging Young to retire: ``There's nothing left for him to
prove on the field, and it would be heresy to see him in a Denver
Broncos uniform. He should hang up his cleats.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact: It is highly unlikely that Young can return to the 49ers,
and he has been told as much by Mariucci. The club does not have
room under its salary cap to accommodate Young, no matter how
contorted the attempts to tweak his contract. He will count $4.2
million against the cap if he plays this season, compared to $1.2
million if he retires or is released after June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion/rumor: Young definitely will play for the Broncos this
season, according to a source in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Broncos coach Mike Shanahan has been so open about his
desire to obtain Young that 49ers general manager Bill Walsh
accused the Broncos of tampering and had the league office look
into the matter. A league spokesman said there was nothing to the
allegation, and Walsh has since said he regretted involving the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor: If Young is done in San Francisco, Seahawks coach and
general manager Mike Holmgren has told Young he will work a trade
to obtain him.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Holmgren has talked to Young this off-season. They have
known each other since 1982, when Holmgren coached Young and the
other quarterbacks at Brigham Young University, and they became
friends while Holmgren was quarterbacks coach and later offensive
coordinator with the 49ers from 1986-91. Holmgren called to
congratulate Young on his marriage and impending fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion: Young doesn't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: He and the 49ers have agreed that no decision will be
announced until after Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion: Young would be crazy to play football again. A
concussion is a bruising of the brain, and he has had too many to
risk playing again.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Young, 38, does not have to play football. He has a law
degree, is involved in a new business venture and also auditioned
for the analyst job on ABC's ``Monday Night Football.'' Money will
not be a factor in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's fundamentally about if I want to expand on my
career, and where is that, and is that possible,'' Young told USA
Today this week in his most extensive interview in nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that you mature, too, and that you
realize the perfect ending might not be storybook,'' he said. ``It
might actually be other than what you expected.''
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: The Seahawks have not set a deadline for releasing
wide receiver Sean Dawkins if he cannot be signed to a new contract
that will reduce his cap number this season. Sources indicated that
Dawkins had until Thursday to agree to a new deal. But Holmgren
said, ``There is not that much of a deadline.''

HOME-COURT A DISADVANTAGE IN WILD WEST FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Normally, it is paramount for the underdog team
to claim a road game in a long playoff series in order to be
successful.
</P>
<P>
   Don't put the Portland Trail Blazers in that category. It is now
imperative they break a curse and win at home.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   On the road is where the Blazers have been most productive in
the Western Conference finals. Home is where they have actually
endured headaches, heartaches and half-hearted performances.
</P>
<P>
   So as Game 6 looms Friday night, the Blazers need only to beat
the Los Angeles Lakers here in order to extend this series to an
anything-can-happen Game 7 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done in the Rose Garden, where the Blazers have
lost their past four conference finals games. The most recent two
defeats were in Games 3 and 4 against L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Portland dominated both games early before succumbing in the
third quarter. The Blazers offset the defeats by winning two in a
row in the Lakers' Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of crazy that it's flip-flopped like this,'' Blazers
guard Steve Smith said. ``But we're going home feeling good about
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Portland is on the brink of elimination, trailing the
series 3-2. Now home court matters, in a matchup where both teams
have worn out their welcome in the others' digs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think home-court advantage is like it used to be,''
Blazers veteran forward Detlef Schrempf said. ``I don't know why,
but it's just not like it used to be 10 years ago. We know we can
win (at Staples) and obviously they know they can win in Portland.
Maybe we're due to win one at home.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no maybe about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers' home drought in the conference finals dates back to
last year. San Antonio swept Portland out of the 1999 playoffs by
winning twice in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Lakers own home-court advantage in this series,
they acknowledged that the Blazers' fan base gives them an edge.
Portland's crowd has done its part, living up to a reputation as
some of the NBA's most frenzied fans.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson made it clear that the Rose Garden is
not one of his favorite places to visit. He said having to return
to Portland for Game 6 was one of the more disappointing aspects of
the Game 5 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to face the abuse we have to face up in Portland,
you would not want to go back up there again,'' Jackson said.
``It's not fun, and it's a daunting crowd that you have to play in
front of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers realize they haven't lived up to their end of the
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   This deep, talented roster has mostly looked average and
short-handed in its own building. In Games 3 and 4, the Blazers
were outshot 50 to 44 percent, allowed more points off turnovers
(44-22), were outrebounded (77-65) and blew double-digit leads.
</P>
<P>
   When they won Games 2 and 5 in Los Angeles, the Blazers outshot
the Lakers 44 to 38 percent. Portland outrebounded L.A., 92-78, and
committed fewer turnovers (21-30).
</P>
<P>
   Portland's biggest lead in a 106-77 Game 2 blowout was 30
points. The Blazers never trailed in the crucial Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've wiped out the fact that we've lost those two games at
home,'' Portland forward Scottie Pippen said. `` ... We're going to
outplay them every time we go on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers aren't exactly shaking in their sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Kobe Bryant said he believes the Lakers have yet to play
their best game. Also,the Lakers would have to lose three
consecutive games _ something they haven't done all season _ to be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel comfortable going back to Portland,'' Bryant said.
``We've been going through a lot of adversity since we've got here
_ getting swept out of the playoffs. So this is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy reminded the media after Game 5 that
he predicted this is how the series would play out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously you guys don't listen to me when I talk,'' Dunleavy
said. ``I told you from the very beginning that I didn't think
there was a home-court advantage in this series. I thought that
either team was capable of winning every game on the other's home
court; that it was going to come down to how you play every night.
That's been the key.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for walking gingerly in a stranger's house.

BLAME GOES ALL AROUND IN MARINERS' LOSS TO WHITE SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariners' defense lost a game Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' offense lost a game Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' pitching lost a game Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Seattle, it was the same game, which means it
only cost the Mariners one game in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   All those losses left a disproportionate number of long faces in
the Mariners' clubhouse after Chicago's 4-3 victory at Safeco
Field, which knocked the Mariners out of first place in the AL
West.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, third baseman John Mabry's ninth-inning error on a
ground ball was the back-breaker, setting up a game-winning bloop
double by Herbert Perry off Kazuhiro Sasaki.
</P>
<P>
   But given what happened over the first eight innings, Perry's
hit and even Mabry's error were overshadowed.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle left 15 runners on base, including going 0-for-5 with
the bases loaded. The generally accepted idea among hitters is that
batting with the bases loaded is the situation in which the hitter
has the greatest advantage, but you wouldn't think so after seeing
Seattle perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of good opportunities to score,'' first baseman
John Olerud said. ``(The White Sox) took advantage of our mistakes.
They definitely had better clutch hitting than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. The Mariners had enough base runners Wednesday to
answer a casting call for a road show of Les Miserables. But the
way Seattle executed its offense when confronted with all those
opportunities would have led Inspector Javert to dump the Mariners'
bats in the Paris sewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plain and simple, we played like dogs,'' shortstop Alex
Rodriguez said of the Mariners, who are now hitting .222 with the
bases loaded this year after batting .271 in the same situation a
year ago. ``Offensively and defensively, we didn't do much as a
team. It was that way the whole series. The way we played, we were
lucky to win one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cameron drew a two-out, bases-loaded walk in the first
inning, but John Olerud and Raul Ibanez failed to come through with
three men on. Seattle loaded the bases in the third inning, but
Ibanez grounded into a double play. In the sixth, with the bases
again loaded, Edgar Martinez popped out. With the bases loaded in
the seventh, Rickey Henderson flew out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners left 12 of their 15 stranded baserunners in those
four innings. Mix in one hit anywhere, and Perry's ninth-inning hit
probably wouldn't have beat them.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Aaron Sele pitched, as they say, well enough to win. But
he also pitched poorly enough to lose, particularly in the seventh
inning, when he squandered a 3-1 lead with a couple of bad pitches
and one poor fielding decision.
</P>
<P>
   After Chris Singleton opened with a leadoff single, Carlos Lee
hit a one-hop comebacker that Sele speared. The double play was
ready to be etched into scorebooks around the stadium, but it never
came. Sele's job was to throw the ball to Rodriguez to start the
double play. But first, he needed to make sure Rodriguez was in
position. Sele needed a bit of patience.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sele threw to second base too soon. Rodriguez was still
two steps away, and the Mariners were lucky that second baseman
Mark McLemore was backing up Rodriguez behind the bag. McLemore
reacted with the cool demeanor of a veteran, whipping the throw to
first base to at least get one out, but Sele had given the White
Sox life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to take a little time there,'' Sele said. ``But I was
so focused on getting the double play that I just got the ball and
threw it. I was lucky Mac was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry was next up, and Sele came back strong with two quick
strikes. Sele then hit Perry with an 0-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' Sele said. ``I made a mistake, but I was feeling
good, in control. I just figured we'd get a double play and get out
of the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. Catcher Tom Lampkin called for a curve and Sele threw
a fastball. Lampkin, completely fooled, saw the ball go to the
backstop for a wild pitch that let both runners advance a base. It
was a pitch for which Sele was kicking himself two hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't give us a chance,'' Sele said. ``I was so locked into
what I was doing that I crossed him up.''
</P>
<P>
   The wild pitch was all manager Lou Piniella needed to see. He
replaced Sele with Arthur Rhodes on a 1-0 count.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I pitched, I forced Lou to take me out,'' Sele said.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Brook Fordyce, with just one hit all year (in 14
at-bats) took a whack at Rhodes' first pitch and slapped a single
into left. Tie game.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, the Mariners loaded the bases for
the fourth time in the game. They got nothing, with Henderson
flying out. After that, there didn't seem to be much zip in the
Mariners' bats.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for that matter, in their gloves. With one out in the ninth
inning and Sasaki attempting to keep the game tied, Lee hit a
relatively routine grounder to third. Mabry, playing third after
having pinch-hit for starter Carlos Guillen, had the ball go under
his glove. Lee alertly raced all the way to second base. Moments
later, Perry's end-of-the-bat fly ball landed a few feet from the
right-field line for a double and the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you should win and you don't, that's when it's
frustrating,'' Lampkin said. ``You have to learn from it and then
forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle can't forget about this one quickly enough.

SEASONED MONARCHS RAIN ON STORM'S WNBA DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MEREDITH BAGLEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Seattle's WNBA franchise is off to an 0-1
start, but there's reason for hope.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on the road Wednesday night against a team many pick to
win the league title, the expansion Storm showed grit and
determination, and led for most of the first half. Experience
caught up to them, however, as the seasoned Monarchs pulled away
from the upstart Storm for a 76-60 victory in ARCO Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought 16 points is not indicative of how competitive the
game was,'' Seattle head coach Lin Dunn said. ``We're just
inexperienced. I've got two players who have been in the WNBA
before and the rest are vagabond rookies from all over. But I can't
fault their effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle held 1999 league MVP, All-Star and U.S. Olympic team
forward Yolanda Griffith to just four points in the first half, and
led by as many as seven points in the opening half.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento came to life in the second half, however, behind the
bruising inside play of 5-foot-11, 206-pound Latasha Byears and the
magical passing of point guard Ticha Penicheiro.
</P>
<P>
   Penicheiro, held to zero points and three assists in the first
half, asserted herself in the second half with 8-for-10 free-throw
shooting and seven assists. Byears finished with 17 points off the
bench to lead the Monarchs, while Griffith, Kedra Holland-Corn,
Katy Steding and former Mead High School star Stacey Clinesmith all
scored 10 for Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the characteristic of a great team,'' Dunn said. ``We
contained their star, but they have other stars to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Byears led the Monarch bench, which accounted for 47 points. By
contrast, Seattle got just eight points from its reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for this team is the bench,'' Dunn said. ``We've got
to get more scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle was led by guard Edna Campbell, the WNBA's leading
scorer in the preseason, with 22 points. Kamila Vodichkova also
turned in a strong night, scoring 20 points and grabbing nine
rebounds while withstanding the Monarchs' physical inside play.
</P>
<P>
   Vodichkova hobbled off the floor with 14:14 to play in the
second half after colliding with Penicheiro and re-injuring her
right knee. She returned to the action, only to be knocked out for
good with just over three minutes remaining after a Sacramento
triple-team inside left her with a black eye.
</P>
<P>
   Vodichkova said after the game she felt the Monarchs benefited
from home-court advantage with the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they felt we could win the fouls helped (Sacramento),''
she said. ``But once it was over and they'd won, it was OK to
whistle anything inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Katrina Hibbert got Seattle on the board and put herself into
the history books with the Storm's first basket at 16:04 of the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking about it,'' the rookie from Australia
insisted, ``but it's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle took a 6-4 lead on Campbell's drive at 14:40 of the
half, and held the advantage for over 10 minutes. The Storm's
biggest lead came at 11:19 when another Campbell jumper made it
15-8 Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento clawed back, using a 6-0 run midway through the half
to take a 20-19 lead with 5:28 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came our real aggressive and took us out of our
offense,'' Sacramento head coach Sonny Allen said. ``I saw them
beat L.A. last week _ they will win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 36-29 as the second half opened, the Storm stayed
close. Seattle forged a 46-46 tie with 11:27 left, and Campbell's
basket with 8:58 to play cut Sacramento's lead to 53-50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy with everything except the last (nine) minutes,''
Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Penicheiro went to work, driving hard on the Monarchs' next
two possessions and drawing fouls. Four free throws later,
Sacramento led by seven and never looked back. Seattle managed only
10 more points in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out well and stayed with them in their house,''
Hibbert said. ``In the second half, the crowd got into it and we
started missing easy shots.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no rest for the weary Storm, as the team caught a 5:30
a.m. flight back to Seattle and will face the three-time world
champion Houston Comets Thursday night at KeyArena at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the toughest row to hoe of the expansion teams,'' Dunn
said. ``But it's gonna pay off. We will be better next week than we
are now because of this schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Storm earned a large dose of respect from
the rabid Monarch fans. Dunn, for one, is not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad respect doesn't get me wins,'' she said.

STORM DUO HAVE INSIDE INFO ON COMETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MEREDITH BAGLEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Two Storm players, Sonja Henning and Andrea
Garner, will see some familiar faces Thursday night when Seattle
hosts Houston in its home opener. Henning was the Comets' starting
point guard last season and guided the defending champions to their
third consecutive title.
</P>
<P>
   Garner, a rookie from Penn State, was Houston's second-round
draft pick this year and landed in Seattle in a last-minute trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be good to see them,'' Garner said. ``There's no hard
feelings between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Comets juggernaut, Seattle could use any inside tips
either player might provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know their plays,'' Garner said, ``but they're great
athletes and it just comes down to defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Henning questioned whether advance notice would even help.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always coming up with new surprises, and even if you
know what's coming you might not be able to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   FULL HOUSE EXPECTED: Karen Bryant, senior director of basketball
operations for the Storm, expects a full house for the home opener
Thursday in KeyArena. With over 10,000 tickets sold by the week's
start, Bryant hopes to hit the arena capacity of 12,969.
</P>
<P>
   Of that number, over 5,200 fans are season ticket holders.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to seeing the best team in the WNBA's short history,
Storm fans will get their first glimpse at the new Storm logo and
the Storm Troop dance team.
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL CONNECTION: Two players with Washington ties took the
floor Wednesday for the Monarchs, with Husky alum Rhonda (Smith)
Banchero and Stacey Clinesmith suited up for Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Clinesmith, a feisty 5-foot-5 guard from Mead High School in
Spokane, is a backup to starting point guard Ticha Penicheiro and
earned her roster spot by proving intensity can overcome lack of
height. Clinesmith was Sacramento's second-round pick in the May
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping it would be Sacramento,'' Clinesmith said. ``I
wanted anything West Coast, to be near my friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   After starting for UC Santa Barbara, Clinesmith is adjusting to
a reserve role in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's new for me, but I'm learning a lot from Ticha,'' she
said. ``It's a whole new level and I'm still trying to take it all
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinesmith has been compared to fellow Spokane native John
Stockton, both in skills and stature, but doesn't know how the
connection started.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's a great player, and we have similar games since we're
smaller,'' Clinesmith said. ``If I'm compared to him, that's
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Banchero is making her return to American professional
basketball after three years in the ABL. The ex-Reign forward, who
will back up 1999 league MVP Yolanda Griffith at the point, is
happy just to be on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go wherever I fit in,'' Banchero said, ``as long as I'm
contributing to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Banchero left the University of Washington as the Huskies'
all-time leading scorer but was surpassed by Storm guard Jamie Redd
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured it would be Jamie,'' Banchero said with a smile.
``When she gets hot, she's good for 40 points.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are good friends who have kept in touch even when
Banchero was playing in Israel this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not like my little sister anymore,'' Banchero said.
``She's a good friend and she'll do well in this league when she
finds her niche.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs visit Seattle on June 15.

ELSTER SAVES DAY FOR INJURY-PRONE DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Injuries weren't much a part of the Dodgers'
debacle last season, though everything else was there.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the clubhouse is quiet and united, the well-being of the
team is the primary focus. And an injury is lurking around every
pitch. This time right-hander Kevin Brown was the victim, taking a
line drive off his right leg that eventually chased him from the
game.
</P>
<P>
   So with a rash of injuries and controversy swirling around the
clubhouse the past two weeks, it was ultra-important the Dodgers
beat the New York Mets 4-3 on Kevin Elster's one-out solo homer in
the bottom of the ninth Wednesday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was Elster's eighth homer of the season. It came on the first
pitch, an expected slider, he saw from Mets reliever Turk Wendell.
``That's why we play, feelings like that,'' Elster said. ``I was
fortunate because I was looking for the one pitch he threw me. I
went up there thinking about hitting one. He likes to throw that
first-pitch slider. He starts it in and get it over the middle of
the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   With the win in hand and the Dodgers salvaging a 4-5 mark on the
homestand by winning two of three from the Mets, the lingering
issue is whether Brown will make his next start.
</P>
<P>
   He limped through the clubhouse, but he said he plans on making
his next start, which will come against one of his former teams,
the Texas Rangers. However, Brown will be re-evaluated today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a matter of anything to check out,'' said
Brown, who allowed one run in six innings. ``It's a matter of
getting rid of the swelling. I think it just missed the bone. Thank
heaven for small favors. I don't have a lot of meat on my legs, but
it got some of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the play in which he was injured, Brown made a
spectacular recovery. Edgardo Alfonzo, who homered in the first
inning, lined a one-out pitch back at Brown. It ricocheted off his
lower leg and toward the first-base line.
</P>
<P>
   Brown raced over, picked it up and threw out Alfonzo, tumbling
and falling again after making the throw. Brown stayed in the game
and retired Mike Piazza on a grounder, but his leg swelled so much
he couldn't continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were saying they never saw anything swell up so quick,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``I hope it's just a contusion.
... The adversity goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Any hint that Brown could be injured is reason for the Dodgers
to shriek. He already missed 16 days this season with a broken
right pinkie, and with regulars Adrian Beltre, Todd Hundley and
Devon White already on the disabled list, losing Brown would be
crushing.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't the only marquee player to leave with an injury.
Piazza, who still stirs emotions from his days at Chavez Ravine,
left with his forehead covered with blood after getting hit by Gary
Sheffield's bat on a follow-through of a swing in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was diagnosed with a slight concussion and one stitch was
needed to close a cut on his forehead. He's expected to play Friday
against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Brown left with a two-run lead, but the erratic Dodgers bullpen,
in one of its down cycles, coughed up another late lead as Alan
Mills allowed a pair of eighth-inning runs.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Kurt Abbott, who had not driven in a run in 63 at-bats
this season, hit a 3-2 pitch deep over the fence in center field to
pull the Mets within 3-2, and Alfonzo doubled off Matt Herges to
right to tie it 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the ninth, Dodgers right-hander Mike Fetters got a
pair of fielder's-choice groundouts with two runners on to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a ground-ball pitcher, and in that situation I'm trying to
get any ground ball I can get,'' said Fetters, who improved to 2-0.
``I think it's a real big win. We didn't have a great homestand,
but with us playing the Mets and taking two of three, and Elster
hitting the walk-off home run, it's a big win.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ We're going to a cyber-wedding. My wife will be a
maid of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the marriage will take place in real time. The music
is by Mozart, who never got to upload his best tunes. So what's so
very virtual about this couple? Answer: They fell in love on the
Internet.

   For richer or poorer, the Internet is here to stay. With upwards
of 100 million Americans tethered to their keyboards, it shouldn't
be surprising that ever-larger numbers surf the Net in search of
romance.
</P>
<P>
   Magazine editors, always on the prowl lest they fall behind the
curve, are well onto this cyber-trend. Some publications take a
couple's online roots for granted and seek to move matters to next
level.
</P>
<P>
   A recent issue of Redbook, for example, notes that ``these days
it's far too easy for a chasm of cyberspace to grow between a
husband and wife. He can spend hour after hour playing a computer
game, and she can't seem to get enough of the Women.com chat
rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, we are told, these problems can be cured with a few
clicks of a mouse, thereby restoring a hard drive to the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   As its authority, Redbook cites Michele Weiner-Davis, a marriage
and family therapist in Woodstock, Ill., and the author of
``Divorce Busting.'' Her insight: ``With the accessibility of
e-mail, we can take the time to do things we wouldn't ordinarily
do, like sending love letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Love letters survive from 150 years ago when Pony Express
mail-order brides were in vogue. During the Gold Rush years, proper
young ladies sailed in packet boats around the tip of South America
to meet their corresponding wealthy suitors in California.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a century later, with millions of Americans under arms,
pen-pal exchanges flourished. Without computer assistance, some of
those letter writers from the 1940s became war brides.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to matters of the heart, however, history remains
an imperfect guide. It's not surprising that a good deal of the
advice on how to fall in love on the Internet is to be found ... on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As gleaned from cyberspace, here are four key rules:
</P>
<P>
   _ It's all right to fool around in the forums, but when it comes
to letting someone become really close to you, ask lots of
questions first.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trade photos before you meet. That way you'll know whether
there's some physical attraction to go along with the virtual
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take it slow and easy. Time will tell if it is to be or not.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't get romantically involved with a married person, even if
he or she tells you it's over.
</P>
<P>
   Our own Internet bride-to-be, a close friend for 25 years, broke
the last rule. The prospective groom is a divorced father who
uncoupled when she finally said ``yes,'' offline, to becoming his
wife No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   At 50, she's never been married before. But you don't need to go
by the presidential commission that hangs in her stately government
office to know that she's a responsible person.
</P>
<P>
   We've yet to ask her whether Bill Clinton will attend. On the
other hand, we don't need Kenneth Starr to remind us that the
president isn't into e-mail.

   WASHINGTON _ We're going to a cyber-wedding. My wife will be a
maid of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the marriage will take place in real time. The music

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Household guns won't stave off tyranny
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just in time for Fathers' Day, the gun crowd is shanghaiing no
less than the Founding Fathers themselves into its service,
bandying about quotes from Jefferson, Franklin and others to the
effect that an armed citizenry is the surest, and an essential,
hedge against tyrannical government.
</P>
<P>
   The quotes are cited in support of an interpretation of the
Second Amendment holding that just about everybody has a
constitutional right to buy any gun they want whenever and wherever
they want and as many at a time as they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind, apparently, that even conservative jurists, such as
the late Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger, have all but
universally found that the amendment is not absolute and is no bar
to public-interest gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   Too, many of the quotes are little more than revolutionary
boilerplate, uttered to whoop up the cause, and were never a part
of the more sober political debate and congressional deliberations
that were summarized in an amendment pegging the right to bear arms
to the maintenance of a well-regulated militia.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there is no reason to suppose the super dads didn't
mean what they said when they said it, even if the sentiments
weren't pointing directly to the eventual constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The founders and their compatriots were reacting against an
arbitrary and insensitive British monarchy and compliant Parliament
-- and against a general European history of autocrats, dictators,
kings and aristocrats. For centuries they had treated their
subjects as nothing better than cannon fodder, tax victims and
pressed labor in whatever enterprise the empowered came to fancy.
</P>
<P>
   A yeoman with a gun could claim something approaching parity
with an armed cavalier; an armed citizenry, parity with an army.
</P>
<P>
   But our founders could not have imagined a firearms industry and
traffic of the sort that bedevil us now. Contrary to nurtured
myths, most colonial and revolutionary households were not armed.
Firearms were hand crafted and expensive, beyond the means -- and
in the cities, of no purpose anyway -- to most early Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It seems fair to assume that even the most militant of the
founders would be appalled at a commerce in street-level firepower
that produces, for instance, handguns so cheap (and incidentally of
such dubious quality) that the real but unacknowledged market for
them is in resale to neighborhood thugs, ex-cons and middle-school
impulse buyers.
</P>
<P>
   For the romantic notion of an armed population as a standing
picket against a suddenly tyrannical government to have any hope
today, the Second Amendment would have to countenance private
fighter planes and bombers, automatic weapons, at least tactical
missiles and neighbor tank corps. (SUVs fall just short.)
</P>
<P>
   The surest preservation of our democracy is not in an assault
rifle in the closet or a .38 in the glove compartment. It is in a
politically alert, caring and engaged citizenry.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Funeral for a mistress; black tie optional
 &HT;    For release Sunday, June 4
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON -- The lady wrote in earnest. She had been to the funeral
of her husband's longtime _ and ``very public'' -- mistress after
debating (a) whether or not to go and (b) what to wear. In
retrospect now, she wondered in writing not about her presence at
the funeral but of her attire.
</P>
<P>
   In her query to the Miss Manners-type columnist for The Weekend
Times of London, Mrs. Name and Address Withheld asked if her choice
of navy blue was appropriate inasmuch as it wasn't mourning black
or celebratory white.
</P>
<P>
   The response was more astonishing than the request; it, too, was
sincere: a delicate gray would have been the ideal shade, wrote the
man from the Weekend Times. There also was the mild, almost
obligatory, admonishment: ``How brave, if inappropriate, of you:
good manners quite excuse a wife's attendance at such events.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Name and Address Withheld, of course, was breaking no new
ground in attending the a tryst-tainted farewell. Did not the widow
of French president Francois Mitterand acquiesce to a graveside
appearance by her late husband's mistress as well?
</P>
<P>
   The table had been set for such attendances, what we were
dealing with in this most recent event was attire. Despite her
choice of navy blue, the letter writer complained, ``all eyes
present still switched from the deceased to me,'' thus prompting
her letter to the newspaper as to whether she had the appropriate
wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   I would have considered that a triumph, not an embarrassment. To
have the old mistress not be the center of the show at her own
funeral should have been celebrated as retribution. I'd have worn a
Hawaiian shirt and white shorts!
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how the world is turning. It is almost acceptable on the
European side of the Atlantic that mistresses are a tolerable part
of daily life. Yes, there is some grouching but reality is reality
to Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the U.S. side, mistresses and other things naughty,
while still raising some apoplectic reaction, are becoming more
common. (We give Europe Starbucks Coffee and McDonald's and they
give us mistress tolerance.)
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Guliani withdrawal from the U.S. Senate race in New York
was accepted more to be based on his prostate cancer rather than
his fooling around. The tearful discourse by wounded wife Donna
Hamilton played a secondary role -- and allowed Rudy to retreat
almst protectively into the empathetic arms of his mistress.
(Mistress number 2, that is.)
</P>
<P>
   Also note how quietly Newt Gingrich recently married the woman
with whom he had an affair to break up his second marriage. We're
sort of getting attuned to these things; certainly not at the
Southern Baptist Conventions, but elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at what has filled out plates in recent years: The
chronic Bill Clinton and retrospective revelations about FDR, LBJ
and Ike as well as the fully named Henry Hyde, Dan Burton and Helen
Chenoweth. Throw in a man general hitting on a lady general, a
school teacher having her student's babies, and a female Air Force
pilot having a verbotten penchant for enlisted men, and we're a
nation in transition.
</P>
<P>
   Is there nothing in our lives that does not have a sexual tone
to it? Do we titter or grumble when we read that liver-lipped movie
actress Angelina Jolie calls out for more sex: ``Before I die, I
wanna taste everyone in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what those dozens of betrayed wives will wear when
Angelina is ready to be buried?
</P>
<P>
   Sex sells. It sells in stores, at movie theaters, in books, in
newspapers, on TV, just about anywhere. Some think Americans are
too puritanical. We're not. We just haven't been as public about
it, for fear of what our neighbor will think.
</P>
<P>
   Led by European example, some of those barriers are beginning to
crumble _ not so much by choice but by the simple fact that
everyone now knows everyone else's private business.
</P>
<P>
   And that which we don't know, we always can ask by writing to a
Miss Manners.

 (Color art is included.) 
 By ERIC HASELTINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Vision so dominates our perception that we give precedence to
what our eyes tell us _ even when that information contradicts more
accurate data coming from other senses.
 &HT;    When you watch television, for example, dialogue seems to emerge
from the actors' mouths, not the set's speakers.
 &HT;    And although many mammals overindulge their eyes as we do, a
few, such as bats and dolphins, navigate by sonar, emitting clicks,
chirps and grunts and using the echoes to determine the location of
things around them.
 &HT;    Sonar may seem a bizarre method of finding one's way, but humans
can be surprisingly good at it. Blind people, for instance,
navigate pretty well by listening to echoes from the tapping of
their canes. We can locate where sounds originate because we have
two ears and a brain that automatically analyzes differences in the
timing and intensity of sounds.
 &HT;    When a noise is closer to one ear than the other, its acoustic
energy will reach that ear faster and louder than the other ear.
Try these experiments to see how well your brain extracts location
from time and intensity cues.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 1  
 &HT;    With a friend, 10 feet of string, a nine-inch square of
cardboard, a straight pin, a soda straw and some tape, make a
``sound locator'' as shown in the accompanying photo. Make sure the
string rests on top of the cardboard and that the straw and the
string don't touch.
 &HT;    Sit in a large, quiet room with your eyes shut and your head
facing forward, holding the locator in front of you. Your friend
grasps the loose end of the string and stands 10 feet away at seven
different points: directly in front of you at 12 (as on the face of
a clock) and near but not exactly at 9, 10, 11, 1, 2 and 3 _ but in
random sequence.
 &HT;    At each new position, your friend sings a single note _ bong _
for two seconds in the lowest pitch he or she can muster. Be
careful that your friend doesn't tug the string too hard _ it will
give her location away.
 &HT;    Point the short end of the straw in the direction you think the
bong came from. Then open your eyes and note if the straw and the
string agree. The difference between the two marks represents the
degree of accuracy with which you locate each sound.
 &HT;    Now repeat the experiment at each of the seven positions _ only
this time have your partner emit a loud click with his or her
tongue and palate. Switch places with your accomplice and compare
performances.
 &HT;    If you're like most people, your errors were small but probably
increased as the bongs and clicks moved farther away from 12. You
should have done better with the clicks, which carry a wider range
of tones for acoustic neurons to work with.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 2  
 &HT;    While voicing bongs in experiment 1, you might have noticed that
the person holding the locator tilted his head. Some blind people _
or those who are deaf in one ear _ do this because the head
rotation provides the brain with information about the intensity of
sounds and their arrival times from different positions, making
noise localization more accurate.
 &HT;    Now, have your friend repeat the bong and click experiment while
you hold the locator. Move your head quickly from side to side to
see if this reduces localization errors. Switch positions and
repeat.
 &HT;    Paying close attention to the acoustic world can help you get
around better in the dark and keep your brain healthy by vigorously
exercising seldom-used auditory pathways.
 &HT;    Visit www.discover.com/brainworks for more sound effects that
exploit time/intensity differences _ but with a riveting third
dimension guaranteed to astonish you.

 &HT;    Vision so dominates our perception that we give precedence to
what our eyes tell us _ even when that information contradicts more
accurate data coming from other senses.
 &HT;    When you watch television, for example, dialogue seems to emerge
from the actors' mouths, not the set's speakers.
 &HT;    And although many mammals overindulge their eyes as we do, a
few, such as bats and dolphins, navigate by sonar, emitting clicks,
chirps and grunts and using the echoes to determine the location of
things around them.
 &HT;    Sonar may seem a bizarre method of finding one's way, but humans
can be surprisingly good at it. Blind people, for instance,
navigate pretty well by listening to echoes from the tapping of
their canes. We can locate where sounds originate because we have
two ears and a brain that automatically analyzes differences in the
timing and intensity of sounds.
 &HT;    When a noise is closer to one ear than the other, its acoustic
energy will reach that ear faster and louder than the other ear.
Try these experiments to see how well your brain extracts location
from time and intensity cues.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 1  
 &HT;    With a friend, 10 feet of string, a nine-inch square of
cardboard, a straight pin, a soda straw and some tape, make a
``sound locator'' as shown in the accompanying photo. Make sure the
string rests on top of the cardboard and that the straw and the
string don't touch.
 &HT;    Sit in a large, quiet room with your eyes shut and your head
facing forward, holding the locator in front of you. Your friend
grasps the loose end of the string and stands 10 feet away at seven
different points: directly in front of you at 12 (as on the face of
a clock) and near but not exactly at 9, 10, 11, 1, 2 and 3 _ but in
random sequence.
 &HT;    At each new position, your friend sings a single note _ bong _
for two seconds in the lowest pitch he or she can muster. Be
careful that your friend doesn't tug the string too hard _ it will
give her location away.
 &HT;    Point the short end of the straw in the direction you think the
bong came from. Then open your eyes and note if the straw and the
string agree. The difference between the two marks represents the
degree of accuracy with which you locate each sound.
 &HT;    Now repeat the experiment at each of the seven positions _ only
this time have your partner emit a loud click with his or her
tongue and palate. Switch places with your accomplice and compare
performances.
 &HT;    If you're like most people, your errors were small but probably
increased as the bongs and clicks moved farther away from 12. You
should have done better with the clicks, which carry a wider range
of tones for acoustic neurons to work with.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 2  
 &HT;    While voicing bongs in experiment 1, you might have noticed that
the person holding the locator tilted his head. Some blind people _
or those who are deaf in one ear _ do this because the head
rotation provides the brain with information about the intensity of
sounds and their arrival times from different positions, making
noise localization more accurate.
 &HT;    Now, have your friend repeat the bong and click experiment while
you hold the locator. Move your head quickly from side to side to
see if this reduces localization errors. Switch positions and
repeat.
 &HT;    Paying close attention to the acoustic world can help you get
around better in the dark and keep your brain healthy by vigorously
exercising seldom-used auditory pathways.
 &HT;    Visit www.discover.com/brainworks for more sound effects that
exploit time/intensity differences _ but with a riveting third
dimension guaranteed to astonish you.

 (Three color slides are available.) 
 By BRAD LEMLEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Aside from hid dancing left foot, Anthony Curtis, 42, looks like
any other sucker tourist dropping a wad at the Binion's Horseshoe
blackjack tables in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    Hair slicked back, nose busted twice from rugby, left hand
curled around his second imported beer _ not water, a dead giveaway
for card-counters _ he seems wound tighter than most, maybe, but
inside the bounds. After three minutes of play, he's down $100.
 &HT;    He's seems distracted by the waitress's cleavage and acts
surprised when his luck turns.
 &HT;    ``My God, this never happens,'' he murmurs as he flips a natural
21: a 10 of hearts and ace of diamonds.
 &HT;    Next two hands, he stands on 17 and 18. The dealer busts both
times. Now he's up $150 _ ``Better quit,'' he says, clumsily
scooping up 12 green chips and striding to the cashout cage. The
pit boss _ whose job it is to spot counters _ smiles and waves at
him. The dealer doesn't even look up.
 &HT;    While Curtis did his dumb-luck shtick above the table, the real
action was below, down on the gaudy carpet. One of the best
blackjack players in the world _ he won the World Match-Play
Blackjack Championship in 1987 _ Curtis counted every card played,
maintaining a multiparameter tally, which means he tracked several
things at once.
 &HT;    His left foot's job was to tick off the aces. When one ace had
been dealt, he put his heel down; second ace, he tilted his foot to
the left; third, up on his toe; fourth, tilted to the right.
Meanwhile, in his head, he kept a running count of the other cards:
Twos and eights each counted as plus one; threes, fours, sixes and
sevens were each plus two; fives were plus three; nines were minus
one; and tens and face cards (which all count as 10 in blackjack)
were minus three.
 &HT;    The idea is that blackjack _ unlike, say, craps _ is a game of
dependent events, and tracking the dealt cards yields valuable
information about the ones that remain. A wealth of tens and aces
left in the deck favors the player, because the player is more
likely to get a blackjack (for which the house pays 1.5 times the
bet) and because the house, which plays by fixed rules, is more
likely to bust.
 &HT;    Whenever Curtis' count went positive _ that is, above zero _ he
boosted his average bets and, on this evening, his winnings. Do it
all while looking like a distracted, none-too-bright vacationing
drunk, and you, too, can win big.
 &HT;    Card-counting can be daunting _ it's a science that's under
constant revision and an art that demands great discipline _ but it
can also be extremely rewarding. By 1989 Curtis had won enough
money at the tables to bankroll a gambling-book publishing house.
He still plays in his off-hours and remains plugged into the
professional blackjack subculture.
 &HT;    Standing shoulder to shoulder with the hapless hordes, Curtis
represents the tiny coterie of mathematically talented, driven,
inconspicuous gamblers who methodically drub the casinos at their
own games.
 &HT;    Even those who don't plan to go pro can learn from the new
gambling elite and turn a potentially impoverishing vacation into a
profitable experience.
 &HT;    ``To figure this stuff out is just very alluring to someone like
me,'' says Olaf Vancura, a casino-game creator with a Ph.D. in
physics and the author of ``Knock-Out Blackjack,'' a new
card-counting system that's within the reach of the average
intellect.
 &HT;    Winning over the long haul demands research, stamina, nerve and
no small measure of acting ability, but the principal requisite is
a rock-solid grounding in probability.
 &HT;    Curtis estimates that 99 percent of what's offered in casinos
and other legal betting venues is what he terms negative
expectation games, meaning that over the long haul, the house will
harvest anywhere from 1 percent to 60 percent of money gambled.
 &HT;    The average bettor accepts his skinning because he imagines the
house odds are insurmountable. The average bettor is wrong. People
always say, ``Who pays for the lights in Las Vegas?'' observes Jean
Scott, a 61-year-old video-poker-playing grandmother who, with her
husband, Brad, earned enough in two years to purchase their Las
Vegas condo. ``All I know is, I don't.''
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    The books that inspired Curtis grew out of a flowering of
scientific gambling analysis that began with ``The Optimum Strategy
in Blackjack,'' an article printed in the September 1956 issue of
the Journal of the American Statistical Association.
 &HT;    Four Army mathematicians, known today as the Baldwin group,
demonstrated how to play each hand to maximize winning potential,
proving that a player who followed their program in a single-deck
game would, over time, be virtually even with the house. That made
blackjack by far the most advantageous casino game to play.
 &HT;    But the giant of blackjack theory, and nearly a god to young
Curtis, was MIT mathematics professor Edward 0. Thorp, who
published ``Beat the Dealer'' in 1962.
 &HT;    The Baldwin group had focused on how to optimize play using each
hand's visible cards, reckoning that card-counting was impractical.
Thorp's twin breakthroughs, bolstered by then-nascent computer
calculation, were that smart folks could learn to count cards as
they were played and that, in doing so, these gamblers could gain a
consistent advantage over the house.
 &HT;    On his own, day after day, Curtis practiced card-counting until
his brain ached and his fingers were raw. At 21, he turned his back
on a UCLA wrestling scholarship, moved to Las Vegas, bellied up to
the Sahara's blackjack pit and put his $1,800 life's savings on the
line.
 &HT;    ``The first night, I won $22. The second day, I lost $900. At
the table, I started hyperventilating. Then I got physically
sick.''
 &HT;    Curtis had slammed into the brutal reality of fluctuation around
the average return, or what statisticians call standard deviation.
Although an astute blackjack card counter can, over the long haul,
realize up to a 1.5 percent profit (depending on such variables as
the number of decks, which card-counting system he employs and how
many cards remain before the dealer reshuffles), losing streaks can
last for weeks. There's a saying: If you can't stand the flux,
don't bet the bucks. Many technically proficient blackjack counters
have been run out by flux.
 &HT;    An elegant mathematical expression of standard deviation's power
in gaming is the so-called risk of ruin, which establishes the
likelihood that a particular bankroll will go to zero before it
doubles.
 &HT;    According to calculations by Vancura, a blackjack card-counter
playing with a 101.11 percent expected return (the expectation of
one version of his card-counting system) and a bankroll that's just
25 times the minimum bet has close to a 47 percent chance of going
broke before doubling his money.
 &HT;    To drop the likelihood of going broke to, say, .5 percent
requires a bankroll 1,000 times larger than the game's minimum
wager; in a $5 to $25 game, that's $5,000.
 &HT;    Chastened, Curtis returned to the real world, first as a
stockbroker, then as the smallest bouncer in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    The lean years ended when Stanford Wong _ the nom de guerre of a
statistics and finance professor who relishes anonymity _ enlisted
Curtis to play tournament blackjack. Financed by Wong, Curtis was
free to make the big bets that would harvest big money.
 &HT;    After he retired from tournament play, Curtis set up his
publishing house. Today, while still winning a sizable return in
his off-hours, he reigns over a stable of authors in his growing
library of gambling science.
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    Even if Vancura's simplified card-counting book achieves
best-seller status, as Thorp's did, the lights will likely keep
blazing just as fiercely in the desert and along the boardwalk and
in the Indian casinos and on the riverboats and aboard the ocean
liners.
 &HT;    Curtis and Vancura seem appalled at the apathy and ignorance of
the average gambler. Successful gambling is unquestionably
possible, and someday, they hope, the fleeced hordes will decide
they've lost enough.
 &HT;    Someday casino profits may shrink from the obscene to the merely
respectable, and the successes of those who win through
intellectual effort rather than luck may inspire a newfound
appreciation for the beauty, wonder and irresistible power of
probability.
 &HT;    But don't bet on it.

 By BRAD LEMLEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Aside from hid dancing left foot, Anthony Curtis, 42, looks like
any other sucker tourist dropping a wad at the Binion's Horseshoe
blackjack tables in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    Hair slicked back, nose busted twice from rugby, left hand
curled around his second imported beer _ not water, a dead giveaway
for card-counters _ he seems wound tighter than most, maybe, but
inside the bounds. After three minutes of play, he's down $100.
 &HT;    He's seems distracted by the waitress's cleavage and acts
surprised when his luck turns.
 &HT;    ``My God, this never happens,'' he murmurs as he flips a natural
21: a 10 of hearts and ace of diamonds.
 &HT;    Next two hands, he stands on 17 and 18. The dealer busts both
times. Now he's up $150 _ ``Better quit,'' he says, clumsily
scooping up 12 green chips and striding to the cashout cage. The
pit boss _ whose job it is to spot counters _ smiles and waves at
him. The dealer doesn't even look up.
 &HT;    While Curtis did his dumb-luck shtick above the table, the real
action was below, down on the gaudy carpet. One of the best
blackjack players in the world _ he won the World Match-Play
Blackjack Championship in 1987 _ Curtis counted every card played,
maintaining a multiparameter tally, which means he tracked several
things at once.
 &HT;    His left foot's job was to tick off the aces. When one ace had
been dealt, he put his heel down; second ace, he tilted his foot to
the left; third, up on his toe; fourth, tilted to the right.
Meanwhile, in his head, he kept a running count of the other cards:
Twos and eights each counted as plus one; threes, fours, sixes and
sevens were each plus two; fives were plus three; nines were minus
one; and tens and face cards (which all count as 10 in blackjack)
were minus three.
 &HT;    The idea is that blackjack _ unlike, say, craps _ is a game of
dependent events, and tracking the dealt cards yields valuable
information about the ones that remain. A wealth of tens and aces
left in the deck favors the player, because the player is more
likely to get a blackjack (for which the house pays 1.5 times the
bet) and because the house, which plays by fixed rules, is more
likely to bust.
 &HT;    Whenever Curtis' count went positive _ that is, above zero _ he
boosted his average bets and, on this evening, his winnings. Do it
all while looking like a distracted, none-too-bright vacationing
drunk, and you, too, can win big.
 &HT;    Card-counting can be daunting _ it's a science that's under
constant revision and an art that demands great discipline _ but it
can also be extremely rewarding. By 1989 Curtis had won enough
money at the tables to bankroll a gambling-book publishing house.
He still plays in his off-hours and remains plugged into the
professional blackjack subculture.
 &HT;    Standing shoulder to shoulder with the hapless hordes, Curtis
represents the tiny coterie of mathematically talented, driven,
inconspicuous gamblers who methodically drub the casinos at their
own games.
 &HT;    Even those who don't plan to go pro can learn from the new
gambling elite and turn a potentially impoverishing vacation into a
profitable experience.
 &HT;    ``To figure this stuff out is just very alluring to someone like
me,'' says Olaf Vancura, a casino-game creator with a Ph.D. in
physics and the author of ``Knock-Out Blackjack,'' a new
card-counting system that's within the reach of the average
intellect.
 &HT;    Winning over the long haul demands research, stamina, nerve and
no small measure of acting ability, but the principal requisite is
a rock-solid grounding in probability.
 &HT;    Curtis estimates that 99 percent of what's offered in casinos
and other legal betting venues is what he terms negative
expectation games, meaning that over the long haul, the house will
harvest anywhere from 1 percent to 60 percent of money gambled.
 &HT;    The average bettor accepts his skinning because he imagines the
house odds are insurmountable. The average bettor is wrong. People
always say, ``Who pays for the lights in Las Vegas?'' observes Jean
Scott, a 61-year-old video-poker-playing grandmother who, with her
husband, Brad, earned enough in two years to purchase their Las
Vegas condo. ``All I know is, I don't.''
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    The books that inspired Curtis grew out of a flowering of
scientific gambling analysis that began with ``The Optimum Strategy
in Blackjack,'' an article printed in the September 1956 issue of
the Journal of the American Statistical Association.
 &HT;    Four Army mathematicians, known today as the Baldwin group,
demonstrated how to play each hand to maximize winning potential,
proving that a player who followed their program in a single-deck
game would, over time, be virtually even with the house. That made
blackjack by far the most advantageous casino game to play.
 &HT;    But the giant of blackjack theory, and nearly a god to young
Curtis, was MIT mathematics professor Edward 0. Thorp, who
published ``Beat the Dealer'' in 1962.
 &HT;    The Baldwin group had focused on how to optimize play using each
hand's visible cards, reckoning that card-counting was impractical.
Thorp's twin breakthroughs, bolstered by then-nascent computer
calculation, were that smart folks could learn to count cards as
they were played and that, in doing so, these gamblers could gain a
consistent advantage over the house.
 &HT;    On his own, day after day, Curtis practiced card-counting until
his brain ached and his fingers were raw. At 21, he turned his back
on a UCLA wrestling scholarship, moved to Las Vegas, bellied up to
the Sahara's blackjack pit and put his $1,800 life's savings on the
line.
 &HT;    ``The first night, I won $22. The second day, I lost $900. At
the table, I started hyperventilating. Then I got physically
sick.''
 &HT;    Curtis had slammed into the brutal reality of fluctuation around
the average return, or what statisticians call standard deviation.
Although an astute blackjack card counter can, over the long haul,
realize up to a 1.5 percent profit (depending on such variables as
the number of decks, which card-counting system he employs and how
many cards remain before the dealer reshuffles), losing streaks can
last for weeks. There's a saying: If you can't stand the flux,
don't bet the bucks. Many technically proficient blackjack counters
have been run out by flux.
 &HT;    An elegant mathematical expression of standard deviation's power
in gaming is the so-called risk of ruin, which establishes the
likelihood that a particular bankroll will go to zero before it
doubles.
 &HT;    According to calculations by Vancura, a blackjack card-counter
playing with a 101.11 percent expected return (the expectation of
one version of his card-counting system) and a bankroll that's just
25 times the minimum bet has close to a 47 percent chance of going
broke before doubling his money.
 &HT;    To drop the likelihood of going broke to, say, .5 percent
requires a bankroll 1,000 times larger than the game's minimum
wager; in a $5 to $25 game, that's $5,000.
 &HT;    Chastened, Curtis returned to the real world, first as a
stockbroker, then as the smallest bouncer in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    The lean years ended when Stanford Wong _ the nom de guerre of a
statistics and finance professor who relishes anonymity _ enlisted
Curtis to play tournament blackjack. Financed by Wong, Curtis was
free to make the big bets that would harvest big money.
 &HT;    After he retired from tournament play, Curtis set up his
publishing house. Today, while still winning a sizable return in
his off-hours, he reigns over a stable of authors in his growing
library of gambling science.
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    Even if Vancura's simplified card-counting book achieves
best-seller status, as Thorp's did, the lights will likely keep
blazing just as fiercely in the desert and along the boardwalk and
in the Indian casinos and on the riverboats and aboard the ocean
liners.
 &HT;    Curtis and Vancura seem appalled at the apathy and ignorance of
the average gambler. Successful gambling is unquestionably
possible, and someday, they hope, the fleeced hordes will decide
they've lost enough.
 &HT;    Someday casino profits may shrink from the obscene to the merely
respectable, and the successes of those who win through
intellectual effort rather than luck may inspire a newfound
appreciation for the beauty, wonder and irresistible power of
probability.
 &HT;    But don't bet on it.

biggest break in the bizarre case _ which has been featured more

 (Three color slides are available.) 
 By BRAD LEMLEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Aside from hid dancing left foot, Anthony Curtis, 42, looks like
any other sucker tourist dropping a wad at the Binion's Horseshoe
blackjack tables in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    Hair slicked back, nose busted twice from rugby, left hand
curled around his second imported beer _ not water, a dead giveaway
for card-counters _ he seems wound tighter than most, maybe, but
inside the bounds. After three minutes of play, he's down $100.
 &HT;    He's seems distracted by the waitress's cleavage and acts
surprised when his luck turns.
 &HT;    ``My God, this never happens,'' he murmurs as he flips a natural
21: a 10 of hearts and ace of diamonds.
 &HT;    Next two hands, he stands on 17 and 18. The dealer busts both
times. Now he's up $150 _ ``Better quit,'' he says, clumsily
scooping up 12 green chips and striding to the cashout cage. The
pit boss _ whose job it is to spot counters _ smiles and waves at
him. The dealer doesn't even look up.
 &HT;    While Curtis did his dumb-luck shtick above the table, the real
action was below, down on the gaudy carpet. One of the best
blackjack players in the world _ he won the World Match-Play
Blackjack Championship in 1987 _ Curtis counted every card played,
maintaining a multiparameter tally, which means he tracked several
things at once.
 &HT;    His left foot's job was to tick off the aces. When one ace had
been dealt, he put his heel down; second ace, he tilted his foot to
the left; third, up on his toe; fourth, tilted to the right.
Meanwhile, in his head, he kept a running count of the other cards:
Twos and eights each counted as plus one; threes, fours, sixes and
sevens were each plus two; fives were plus three; nines were minus
one; and tens and face cards (which all count as 10 in blackjack)
were minus three.
 &HT;    The idea is that blackjack _ unlike, say, craps _ is a game of
dependent events, and tracking the dealt cards yields valuable
information about the ones that remain. A wealth of tens and aces
left in the deck favors the player, because the player is more
likely to get a blackjack (for which the house pays 1.5 times the
bet) and because the house, which plays by fixed rules, is more
likely to bust.
 &HT;    Whenever Curtis' count went positive _ that is, above zero _ he
boosted his average bets and, on this evening, his winnings. Do it
all while looking like a distracted, none-too-bright vacationing
drunk, and you, too, can win big.
 &HT;    Card-counting can be daunting _ it's a science that's under
constant revision and an art that demands great discipline _ but it
can also be extremely rewarding. By 1989 Curtis had won enough
money at the tables to bankroll a gambling-book publishing house.
He still plays in his off-hours and remains plugged into the
professional blackjack subculture.
 &HT;    Standing shoulder to shoulder with the hapless hordes, Curtis
represents the tiny coterie of mathematically talented, driven,
inconspicuous gamblers who methodically drub the casinos at their
own games.
 &HT;    Even those who don't plan to go pro can learn from the new
gambling elite and turn a potentially impoverishing vacation into a
profitable experience.
 &HT;    ``To figure this stuff out is just very alluring to someone like
me,'' says Olaf Vancura, a casino-game creator with a Ph.D. in
physics and the author of ``Knock-Out Blackjack,'' a new
card-counting system that's within the reach of the average
intellect.
 &HT;    Winning over the long haul demands research, stamina, nerve and
no small measure of acting ability, but the principal requisite is
a rock-solid grounding in probability.
 &HT;    Curtis estimates that 99 percent of what's offered in casinos
and other legal betting venues is what he terms negative
expectation games, meaning that over the long haul, the house will
harvest anywhere from 1 percent to 60 percent of money gambled.
 &HT;    The average bettor accepts his skinning because he imagines the
house odds are insurmountable. The average bettor is wrong. People
always say, ``Who pays for the lights in Las Vegas?'' observes Jean
Scott, a 61-year-old video-poker-playing grandmother who, with her
husband, Brad, earned enough in two years to purchase their Las
Vegas condo. ``All I know is, I don't.''
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    The books that inspired Curtis grew out of a flowering of
scientific gambling analysis that began with ``The Optimum Strategy
in Blackjack,'' an article printed in the September 1956 issue of
the Journal of the American Statistical Association.
 &HT;    Four Army mathematicians, known today as the Baldwin group,
demonstrated how to play each hand to maximize winning potential,
proving that a player who followed their program in a single-deck
game would, over time, be virtually even with the house. That made
blackjack by far the most advantageous casino game to play.
 &HT;    But the giant of blackjack theory, and nearly a god to young
Curtis, was MIT mathematics professor Edward 0. Thorp, who
published ``Beat the Dealer'' in 1962.
 &HT;    The Baldwin group had focused on how to optimize play using each
hand's visible cards, reckoning that card-counting was impractical.
Thorp's twin breakthroughs, bolstered by then-nascent computer
calculation, were that smart folks could learn to count cards as
they were played and that, in doing so, these gamblers could gain a
consistent advantage over the house.
 &HT;    On his own, day after day, Curtis practiced card-counting until
his brain ached and his fingers were raw. At 21, he turned his back
on a UCLA wrestling scholarship, moved to Las Vegas, bellied up to
the Sahara's blackjack pit and put his $1,800 life's savings on the
line.
 &HT;    ``The first night, I won $22. The second day, I lost $900. At
the table, I started hyperventilating. Then I got physically
sick.''
 &HT;    Curtis had slammed into the brutal reality of fluctuation around
the average return, or what statisticians call standard deviation.
Although an astute blackjack card counter can, over the long haul,
realize up to a 1.5 percent profit (depending on such variables as
the number of decks, which card-counting system he employs and how
many cards remain before the dealer reshuffles), losing streaks can
last for weeks. There's a saying: If you can't stand the flux,
don't bet the bucks. Many technically proficient blackjack counters
have been run out by flux.
 &HT;    An elegant mathematical expression of standard deviation's power
in gaming is the so-called risk of ruin, which establishes the
likelihood that a particular bankroll will go to zero before it
doubles.
 &HT;    According to calculations by Vancura, a blackjack card-counter
playing with a 101.11 percent expected return (the expectation of
one version of his card-counting system) and a bankroll that's just
25 times the minimum bet has close to a 47 percent chance of going
broke before doubling his money.
 &HT;    To drop the likelihood of going broke to, say, .5 percent
requires a bankroll 1,000 times larger than the game's minimum
wager; in a $5 to $25 game, that's $5,000.
 &HT;    Chastened, Curtis returned to the real world, first as a
stockbroker, then as the smallest bouncer in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    The lean years ended when Stanford Wong _ the nom de guerre of a
statistics and finance professor who relishes anonymity _ enlisted
Curtis to play tournament blackjack. Financed by Wong, Curtis was
free to make the big bets that would harvest big money.
 &HT;    After he retired from tournament play, Curtis set up his
publishing house. Today, while still winning a sizable return in
his off-hours, he reigns over a stable of authors in his growing
library of gambling science.
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    Even if Vancura's simplified card-counting book achieves
best-seller status, as Thorp's did, the lights will likely keep
blazing just as fiercely in the desert and along the boardwalk and
in the Indian casinos and on the riverboats and aboard the ocean
liners.
 &HT;    Curtis and Vancura seem appalled at the apathy and ignorance of
the average gambler. Successful gambling is unquestionably
possible, and someday, they hope, the fleeced hordes will decide
they've lost enough.
 &HT;    Someday casino profits may shrink from the obscene to the merely
respectable, and the successes of those who win through
intellectual effort rather than luck may inspire a newfound
appreciation for the beauty, wonder and irresistible power of
probability.
 &HT;    But don't bet on it.

   LOS ANGELES _ There's a lot of fun to be had in ``Mission:
Impossible 2,'' the action-packed John Woo movie.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the plot, which, unlike that of its predecessor,
actually holds up to scrutiny without the help of a Ph.D.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there are the spectacular special effects and sometimes
breathtaking cinematography.
</P>
<P>
   Third, there's the trio of stars _ Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott and
Thandie Newton _ who cavort, canoodle, conquer and even collapse
while exuding at all times a staggering beauty and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference four years make. In the 1996 film adaptation
of the famous television series, Cruise's Ethan Hunt was a
clean-cut, close-cropped dandy who dashed about his business of
international espionage in sharp gray suits, french blue shirts and
matching ties without incurring so much as a wrinkle, a rip or a
loose button.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 version, Hunt has grown into a man _ a real man,
with a permanent three-day beard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different film,'' said ``M:I-2'' costume designer Lizzy
Gardiner. ``It's much rougher, hipper, warmer and more romantic.
It's not about coldness and perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian-born Gardiner, who won an Academy Award for her work
on the 1994 film ``Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'' (and gained
even more notoriety thanks to the American Express-card dress she
wore to the ceremony), spent seven months outfitting the cast of 15
main characters and 15,000 extras.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Getaway,' with Ali McGraw and Steve McQueen, was my
biggest influence,'' she said. ``I wanted it to look like there was
no costume designer. Today, things are rougher, readier and a
little more relaxed in the movies and in costume design.''
</P>
<P>
   For the character of Ethan Hunt, the farmers' son-turned-spy,
``What Tom and I discussed was a shared belief that this was a man
too busy saving the world and the girl to be vain,'' she said. ``We
never wavered from our view of the character, the heterosexual man
saving the world. That will be one of the aspects of the film that
will make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, Gardiner dressed the star in unkempt, never-ironed
clothes a la Steve McQueen. ``It's difficult for a designer to step
back and let things go,'' she said. ``The film is more about the
character than about fabulous fashion, but at the same time, he had
to look fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner designed and made many of Cruise's outfits, as well as
relying heavily on Prada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally I'm very reticent to get involved with fashion
designers, because fashion is dated by the time the film is out,''
she said. ``But Prada gave me complete access to its collection one
year before it was available to the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, adds Gardiner, Ethan Hunt ``is a guy who wouldn't
know who Prada was.''
</P>
<P>
   In the adrenaline-charged action scenes, Cruise wears brushed
cottons, washed moleskins and suede in muddy green, taupe and
black. His T-shirts, jackets, cargo pants and jeans are soiled and
frayed as if they had taken a beating from more than the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Dougray Scott's character, Sean Ambrose _ Hunt's strikingly
handsome former fellow agent-turned-adversary in love and war _ is
rather vain, unlike his nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more conscious of his image, the way men are in L.A.,''
Gardiner said.
</P>
<P>
   The results prove him right: In gray-and-black cropped jackets,
slim-cut pants, shirts and ties by Gardiner, Prada and Clements
Ribeiro, the 6-foot-tall, black-haired, blue-eyed villain makes
evil look very tempting, indeed _ so tempting, in fact, that one
wonders why the heroine's choice between Hunt and Ambrose (both of
whom she has, to put it delicately, dated) was not more of a
tossup.
</P>
<P>
   In the final scene, which takes up approximately one-third of
the movie, Scott packs a mean punch _ literally and figuratively _
in a highly unusual denim ensemble of Gardiner's design comprised
of a suit, shirt and diagonally striped tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough coming up with something that would protect
Dougray from the stunts, that was not flammable and that looked
fabulous for such a large amount of time,'' said Gardiner, who made
17 renditions of that particular suit. ``To be able to supply that
number of outfits for the stunts in order to protect active bodies,
you have to make the clothes yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott also wore a padded suit under his clothes to further
insulate him from bumps, bruises and burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to stay away from the uptight, polished, preppie
American male,'' said Gardiner of the other male leads _ the
``rough boys'' _ whom she dressed in a mix of her designs, Prada,
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Diesel, and Australian labels Mambo and Marcs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Australia, we call them `rough trade' _ they're dirty,
handsome and gorgeous,'' she said. ``I tried to bring my admiration
and respect for Australian men into the film.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Author/illustrator Bev Doolittle shares love of the wilderness
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ She labels the most dramatic change in her life
as ``the whole wilderness thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened in 1973 when she and her husband, both landscape
painters, left advertising jobs and spent a year traveling and
living out of a 1957 Chevy pickup they converted into a camper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was magical for me,'' says Bev Doolittle, who became
fascinated by the animals and American Indians who inhabited the
places they visited _ Yosemite, Sequoia National Park, the Grand
Canyon, Banff and the Canadian Rockies _ while hiking, sketching,
photographing and painting.
</P>
<P>
   She has been exploring the wilderness and sharing it with others
ever since and today is one of the United States' most popular
limited-edition print artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Earth Is My Mother'' (Greenwich Workshop Press, $17.95),
the family novel, written by Elise Maclay, is the story of
11-year-old Sarah Stewart, who sets out to save a beloved canyon _
rich with an American Indian legacy and memories of her mother _
from developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to acquaint people with the wilderness and how
special it is,'' explains Doolittle. ``It's about the courage one
person can have to make a change by following your own passions.
The bottom line is that everybody should have the opportunity to
follow their passion and enjoy life.''
</P>
<P>
   Doolittle spent a year creating the 16 watercolors and 55
black-and-white drawings that illustrate the book. ``It's all of
the paintings I've done in the past 20 years rolled into one,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   And her work is used in an innovative way. When Sarah, the lead
character, sets out on a journey into the canyon with her camera,
the photos she takes are actually Bev Doolittle's paintings. Later,
the smaller ``photos'' combine into a large picture that
communicates the novel's message. That image is bound into the book
as a removable poster as well.
</P>
<P>
   Doolittle is best known for her camouflage paintings. Look
carefully among the wildflowers on the cover of her new book, for
example, and you'll spot eyes, nose, a mouth, a face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camouflage is something that happens everywhere in nature, you
just have to keep your antennae out,'' Doolittle says. ``It's a
means to an end. It helps me tell the story, it slows down the
process and helps to guide your eye . . . or confuse. I think of it
as a tool, a way to discover what Mother Nature does.''
</P>
<P>
   Doolittle has collaborated with Elise Maclay on five books _
including a children's book, ``The Forest Has Eyes.'' She hopes
readers of all ages will feel connected to nature after reading
these books and will want to ``go out into nature and perhaps
become a little more respectful of it . . . and feel the same
things we feel when we're out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Doolittle grew up in California and always dreamed of being an
artist. A Campfire Girl and Bluebird, she has fond memories of
camping out with her large family. Now she lives in the California
high desert near Palm Springs and paints every day on a porch
that's been converted into her studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get away once or twice a year for the solitude, to
gather my wits and reconnect,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Sarah in her new book originated with her husband,
Jay, who came up with the plot while hiking in the Palm Springs
canyons. ``I fell in love with it because it's about all the things
we care about,'' Doolittle says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarah learns that each species _ whether it swims or flies or
travels on four feet _ fills a needed space in the whole of the
natural world.''
</P>
<P>
   Doolittle and her publisher have contributed more than $1
million to wildlife organizations and to the Juvenile Diabetes
Foundation.

 &HT;    Words of advice for a recent college graduate
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Kasey:
</P>
<P>
   I can't believe it's already been four years since your high
school graduation. At this rate, I'll be dead in no time. Now
you're a college graduate with highest honors from the University
of Texas at Austin, the second generation of our family to be an
official Texas-Ex. The first generation, namely me, didn't get any
type of ``honor'' appellation next to the diploma. I was just proud
to eke out a master's degree in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   I'm so proud of you. You flew through undergraduate school in
four years, made just two ``B's'' in that time, and now you're off
to face the real world. I became a bit teary-eyed at the ceremony
as I realized:
</P>
<P>
   You are officially grown up now, ready to make your mark in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking you off my payroll means I will receive a hefty pay
raise.
</P>
<P>
   As to which brought the tears to my eyes, I can't say for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Being your dad, I am full of free advice now that you have a
college degree, though if everything goes according to plan you
will escape into the safe cocoon of graduate school in a year. On
your nickel, of course. I have made that clear, haven't I?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if you end up doing something for a living
that has nothing to do with your degree _ and you discover that you
enjoy it. Your plan is to be a speech therapist, like your mom.
That's an admirable profession. But life is full of surprises, so
don't feel guilty or somehow shortchanged if you end up working in
another field. What's important is that you enjoy what you do and
that you believe you're making a contribution. Money is nice, but a
high-paying job that you hate will put you in the grave quicker
than something that doesn't pay as well but provides a great deal
of satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Read everything you can get your hands upon. Fiction,
non-fiction, magazines and, of course, newspapers. A fellow
newspaper publisher has threatened for years to rent a billboard
that says: ``Don't be ignorant all your life. Read the newspaper.''
That might be a bit harsh, but just because you're out of college
doesn't mean it's time to stop learning. The world you're entering
changes at a dizzying rate, and it's all middle-aged fogies like me
can do to pretend to keep up. It's going to be even harder for you,
because the changes are going to come more quickly and be even more
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Do some good in the world. Both you and your sister have always
been involved in volunteer activities to help other people. Keep
doing that. You've been blessed in life, and giving something back
is a way to say thanks. Plus, it's fun.
</P>
<P>
   On a related note, get involved in your community, whether it's
through civic groups, neighborhood associations, politics or
however. Big city or small, there are people involved all over in
trying to make where they live a better place. Don't just rely on
them to do the heavy lifting. Do some lifting yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Take care of your little sister. She managed to survive her
first year at UT, and I know you helped her adjust to the big city.
I still cringe every time I think of her driving in Austin, so I
try not to think about it. Keep an eye on Goose. That's what big
sisters do.
</P>
<P>
   Don't jump off, get married and start having babies right away
now that you're out of college. I'm way too young to be a
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Find a hobby. Going out on Friday night does not constitute a
hobby, not that it's all bad. Take up golf, tennis, hiking, pottery
_ anything that provides a diversion from work and that you enjoy
doing. As you get older and life gets more stressful, you'll find
that having a hobby will help keep you on an even keel.
</P>
<P>
   There will be disappointments and setbacks. Not getting into
graduate school on the first try was certainly a setback. But
that's life. Few things come easy, and plans don't always work out.
Just keep plugging away. Remember I'm just a phone call away if you
need some moral support or advice.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't ask for money.
</P>
<P>
   Love,
</P>
<P>
   Dad.

 &HT;    DNA question puts Bush's claim on trial
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ricky McGinn was scheduled to die Thursday. In
1995, McGinn, who had a record of sexual assault, was convicted of
murdering and raping his 12-year-old stepdaughter in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against McGinn was strong: blood on his car that
could have come from less than 1 percent of people other than the
victim, and hair that matched the victim's on an ax identified as
the murder weapon.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn's attorneys and death-penalty opponents were pressing
last-minute appeals to try to save him, including pleas for new DNA
tests they say could free him.
</P>
<P>
   But on trial as well is death-penalty advocate and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee for president.
Bush, who has had more prisoners executed during his tenure than
all previous Texas governors combined, just last Friday endorsed
DNA testing if it can help clear up a case one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we've executed a single innocent person,''
Bush said from Austin in a teleconference with a Roman Catholic
journalists' organization meeting in Baltimore. ``If the DNA
testing helps to settle a case or erase any doubts or concerns, we
would support that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in another case, made good on that pledge Wednesday. He
pardoned A.B. Butler of Tyler, who spent 16 years in prison
wrongfully accused of the abduction and rape of a Tyler woman,
after new DNA tests caused law enforcement officials and then the
Texas Department of Pardons and Paroles to recommend a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn's attorneys similarly say DNA testing not available when
he was tried could now clear him. His appellate attorney, Richard
Alley of Fort Worth, said earlier DNA tests were inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Stephen Ellis, who had presided over
McGinn's final death sentence this year after his appeals were
exhausted, though not McGinn's 1995 trial, on May 25 asked the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to allow additional DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence before the court for the first time that if
they were retested using modern technology the results might
exonerate the defendant,'' Judge Ellis wrote.
</P>
<P>
   While cautioning that the preponderance of trial evidence still
would seem to show McGinn guilty rather than innocent, Ellis noted
that Texas ``has acknowledged that DNA testing has advanced
significantly since the time of the trial in this case. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to this court that the need for finality in this
case although very important is not as important as the need to
ensure that justice is done,'' the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, all
Republicans, on Tuesday denied the request. Three judges _ Steve
Mansfield, Tom Price and Sue Holland _ thought it should be
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just astonishing,'' said Barry Scheck of the Innocence
Project in New York, which has offered to pay the $1,500 to $3,000
cost of the DNA testing by experts of the state's choosing, with
the results reported directly to judicial authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The governor cannot commute a death sentence or grant clemency
without the recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and
Paroles. He can, however, make a one-time, 30-day stay to give a
condemned prisoner additional time for court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the governor would not make a decision on that until after
the Parole Board has met and reviewed the case and ruled,'' press
spokesman Mike Jones said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the appeal to the state Board of Pardons and
Paroles, McGinn's attorneys also appealing to the Fifth U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals and, if necessary, the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Alley, who has represented McGinn on his constitutional appeals,
said McGinn's case could test the governor's claim ``that we don't
execute innocent people.'' The U.S. Department of Justice and the
American Bar Association, among others, have endorsed
post-conviction DNA testing with new technology, Alley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get a chance to do it later,'' Alley said. ``All
we're asking for is the time to get the testing done. The state
doesn't even have to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, the Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 11-7
against a reprieve. And Bush, campaigning in New Mexico, said he
was ``inclined'' to grant a 30-day reprieve for the new DNA tests.

 &HT;    Private schools no sanctuary from violence
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's admit it to ourselves just for a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Private school.
</P>
<P>
   Are you thinking about it, too?.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter did it, and he has a good heart. So did Clinton,
although he is not exactly our yardstick for moral behavior. And
although I'm a liberal _ I like my son to go to school with
children who speak Spanish at home, children who have survived
divorce, children whose parents are from Romania and Cuba and Haiti
_ right now I'm sad and confused and scared.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, I'm thinking: Wouldn't he be safer at some small,
pricey private school?
</P>
<P>
   Fear does funny things to the common sense.
</P>
<P>
   On the first work day after Barry Grunow's shooting death, I
called Jose Garcia, a principal at Conniston Middle School. Garcia
knows a little something about the heartbreak of a school shooting.
He was assistant principal there when a student was shot dead on
campus in 1997. Tuesday, he pulled his staff together, had a
meeting, sent the folks at Lake Worth Middle School a nice note.
</P>
<P>
   ``We at Conniston Middle School understand what you are going
through. This has reopened some old wounds. No one can ever begin
to understand the horror, pain and loss that incidents like this
cause. Please be strong, support each other and allow for the
healing to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess parents have no choice but to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not easy. We're afraid to send our kids to school on
the last day of school. I've always worried about car wrecks and
old friendships and the checking account balance, but I've never
worried about sending my son to celebrate the final school day of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Cole is a mother of four children. She does not have the
financial means for their private education, doesn't know that she
would go that route even if she could. So she picks and chooses,
tours campuses and tries, as best she can, to send her children to
places where she feels they're safe.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's next-to-the- youngest daughter just finished her first
year at Roosevelt Middle School in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do wonder,'' she said. ``There's a rough element at
Roosevelt, and that may not be P.C. But it's a fact. There are some
tough kids there. She had things stolen from her locker.''
</P>
<P>
   Did she worry about her every day?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said. ``I didn't have that luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   Will she now? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Mutz, the admissions director at The Kings Academy, a
private Christian school, said their enrollment has been pretty
constant the last 10 years, despite our social scares. ``Even when
Columbine happened, nothing really changed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean we're not out here thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia says I'm brainwashed by my own fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have been indoctrinated, so you are associating that the
wealthier environment is safer,'' he said. ``I think a school is a
school is a school. We need to focus on reducing the amount of harm
these young people are going through.''
</P>
<P>
   We need to realize there is nowhere to hide.

 &HT;    A Hollywood insider deconstructs the styles of the celebs you
love to look at.
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Her response to The Post's recent fashion
survey began, ``For some reason or other I never learned 'to put
myself together' to my satisfaction,'' and ended with, ``I love to
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Mains sounded like a dream candidate for a wardrobe
makeover, demonstrating both desire and good humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never given much thought to how I look,'' said Mains, a
bubbly 72-year-old. ``The time has come that I should do something
about it before I die.''
</P>
<P>
   And so image consultant Susan Bigsby plunged into Mains' tidy
Palm City closet, only to find that the Puerto Rico native was
already doing an awful lot right. She just needed a little
encouragement and a few minor tweaks.
</P>
<P>
   Bigsby first assured Mains that she needn't overcomplicate her
retiree's casual wardrobe. If Mains typically wears shorts for her
volunteer work and flowing dresses for church, there's no need to
go above and beyond. Why buy a suit for the sake of buying a suit?
</P>
<P>
   Bigsby also encouraged Mains to rid her closet of several drab
dresses (''You need color, like most mature women who have gone
gray and don't wear a lot of makeup,'' Bigsby said) and a pair of
clunky white sandals from 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. Simpson shoes,'' Mains said, pointing to the Bruno Magli
label. ``They are out of style,'' said Bigsby, adding that white
tends to make feet look bigger. ``You have all these little beachy
sandals, and you need to have some pretty sandals,'' something a
little more feminine.
</P>
<P>
   For her corporate clients, Bigsby advises neutral separates that
can be easily mixed and matched. That's the wrong approach for
Mains, though, who likes to buy outfits rather than individual
pieces and whose big personality demands vibrant colors.
</P>
<P>
   A cream-colored three-piece knit outfit is banished from the
closet. ``This is so boring for the kind of personality you have,''
Bigsby tells Mains. ``You have more spunk than that outfit does.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Mains tends to carry extra weight around her middle, she
needs long, lean lines. And although she has undeniably great legs,
trying to show them off will ultimately make her look top heavy.
That's why her choice of long dresses works so well. On the day of
Bigsby's visit, Mains came to the door in an ankle-skimming navy
print dress, one of many she owned. ``This is good for you. I think
this suits you wonderfully,'' Bigsby said.
</P>
<P>
   After awhile, Mains starts to pick up what works and what
doesn't. It is she who makes the first move to toss a mint-green
twin set. ``Serves me right for buying it on special at Laura
Ashley,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also gone, a girlish plaid dress with ruffles down the front.
``Why did I buy this?'' Mains said. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how to build a wardrobe isn't the easiest skill to
acquire, but it's not impossible, Bigsby said. ``If you've never
had anyone show you how to do it, it's hard to learn on your own,''
Bigsby said. ``Somebody's got to teach you.''
</P>
<P>
   And magazines aren't always the answer, for they largely report
trends instead of teach concepts.
</P>
<P>
   Image consultants or well-dressed friends can help you learn the
basics of shaping a wardrobe and finding clothes that flatter your
figure, your lifestyle and your pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you know what to look for, you eliminate half the store
automatically,'' Bigsby said. ``You have to have a reason to have
things in your closet. Otherwise you're just wasting money.
Something could be pretty, but do you need it?''
</P>
<P>
   Bigsby told Mains, ``I try to dress people for who they are, and
this closet is perfect for you.''

 &HT;    Mama mia, you love Sophia!
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Why do readers admire Sophia Loren's style?
If you have to ask, you'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? Are you kidding?'' says Ann Fintz of West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask why! It's just there!'' says Suzanne Cohen of West
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   In our recent fashion survey of readers, the luscious Loren, who
turns 66 this September, topped the favorite celebrity style
category.
</P>
<P>
   Readers gaze admiringly at a constellation of stars, ranging
from Gardens mall spokesmodel Lauren Hutton (``classic, simple and
unassuming'') to rapper Mary J. Blige (``dresses really nice with
the classy clothes'').
</P>
<P>
   From Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (``neat, tailored,
not dowdy'') to singing talk show host Marie Osmond (``her dress at
the Miss America pageant was to die for!'').
</P>
<P>
   From perky actress Meg Ryan (``simple . . . but with a slight
sexiness'') to Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton (``great
suits'').
</P>
<P>
   Other multiple mentions: Dina Merrill, Ann Currie, Julia
Roberts, Gwyneth Paltrow and Hollywood youngsters Jennifer Love
Hewitt, Keri Russell, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   We asked celebrity stylist Phillip Bloch, whose clients include
Salma Hayek, Cindy Crawford, Jim Carrey and Jenna Elfman, to
deconstruct what the top vote-getters do and the way that they do
it.
</P>
<P>
   SOPHIA LOREN
</P>
<P>
   WHAT READERS SAY:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dresses in good taste,'' says Sandra Lucca.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looks so mature and calm,'' says Angela Ward. ``She's such
a beautiful person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart and sexy,'' says Connie Valente of Wellington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her clothing looks sharp but comfortable,'' says Marla
Massman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the classy but sexy hourglass look,'' says Andrea
Parvin. ``She's always perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   What the stylist says:
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just incredibly chic. She still works her best assets,
and yet she's not vulgar about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wears the right shapes for herself. She doesn't try to
dress too young, too old or too loud. She's very tasteful.''
</P>
<P>
   What we can learn from Sophia:
</P>
<P>
   Dress your age.
</P>
<P>
   ``She definitely looks sexy, with her large breasts and curvy
figure,'' Bloch says. ``She accentuates that _ not like a woman of
20 would but like a woman her age would.''
</P>
<P>
   CHER
</P>
<P>
   WHAT READERS SAY:
</P>
<P>
   ``She always looks so special and sexy,'' says Terry Kline.
</P>
<P>
   ``She so doesn't care what people think,'' says Diana Goodwill
Brovero.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is lucky enough to be able to wear those outrageous
outfits,'' says Suzi Lavati.
</P>
<P>
   What the stylist says:
</P>
<P>
   ``Good lord! She travels to the beat of her own drummer, and I
think that's what people admire about her. She does what she wants
when she wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just is what she is. . . . Cher will show every part of
her body, and we love that about her.''
</P>
<P>
   What we can learn from Cher:
</P>
<P>
   Be yourself and have the courage of your convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not afraid, and that's what people like,'' Bloch says.
``She has the charisma to pull that off.''
</P>
<P>
   BARBRA STREISAND
</P>
<P>
   WHAT READERS SAY:
</P>
<P>
   ``Elegant,'' says Barbara Weisser, ``especially in casual
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tailored look,'' says Irene Wainick.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always looks elegant and sleek,'' says Ellin Berger.
</P>
<P>
   What the stylist says:
</P>
<P>
   ``She goes for casual chic,'' Bloch says. ``She's casual enough.
She's not over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, ``Barbra is very convinced about what she feels is
right about her, and so she really works those points.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bloch, Barbra likes her legs, shoulders and neck,
but prefers to camouflage her waist.
</P>
<P>
   What we can learn from Barbra:
</P>
<P>
   Know what works for you.
</P>
<P>
   Barbra isn't very adventurous with color, cleaving to the
cleanness of black, white or gray.
</P>
<P>
   (The right connections help: One of Barbra's best pals is
designer Donna Karan. ``She's got a good friend in the business,''
Bloch says.)
</P>
<P>
   HALLE BERRY
</P>
<P>
   WHAT READERS SAY:
</P>
<P>
   ``She is always sophisticated and sexy-looking, whether in jeans
or a gown,'' says Kimberly Frantantoni.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always dressed to the nines,'' says Marcia Billhartz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casual, yet stylish and fashionable,'' says Arma Velasquez.
</P>
<P>
   What the stylist says:
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my client _ I dress her all the time. She can look
beautiful in anything. . . . She can go from Doris Day to Natalie
Wood to Brigitte Bardot. She covers all the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry looks luminous in a range of colors, and also looks as
comfortable in a dressy Valentino as in avant-garde Comme des
Garcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's well-rounded, which is why I think she appeals to
people.''
</P>
<P>
   What we can learn from Halle:
</P>
<P>
   Celebrate what you've got, but don't flaunt it.
</P>
<P>
   Berry has a feminine, curvy body, ``but you don't think of her
as a sex symbol,'' Bloch says. Because she's not pigeonholed as a
sex goddess, her style can run the gamut.
</P>
<P>
   GRACE KELLY AND AUDREY HEPBURN
</P>
<P>
   WHAT READERS SAY:
</P>
<P>
   About Audrey _ ``I like simplicity, not frills,'' says Mindy
Presler of Hobe Sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Total elegance,'' says Jane Muller of Lake Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty, harmony, simplicity incarnate,'' says Enid Sefcovic of
Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
   About Grace _ ``Refined and dignified,'' says a Delray Beach
reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wore simple, elegant, graceful clothes that said, `I'm
Grace Kelly _ STAR!','' says Suzanne Seely of Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   What the stylist says:
</P>
<P>
   Simple, classic and timeless. ``The gowns that Grace Kelly wore
are like the one Hilary Swank wore to the Oscars. . . The shift
dresses that Audrey Hepburn made famous are still good now. You can
wear them to the office, you can wear them to breakfast at
Tiffany's.''
</P>
<P>
   What we can learn from Grace and Audrey:
</P>
<P>
   Study up and major in the classics.
</P>
<P>
   Bloch says, ``I personally use them as style guides for my girls
many times.''

 &HT;    Court delivers a victory to father
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANMTA _ A federal appeals court ruled today that immigration
officials acted within their rights when they denied an asylum
hearing to 6-year-old Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The decision handed down by a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals apparently clears the way for the boy's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to take his son back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives have 14 days to ask all 12 judges of the
11th Circuit to review the case, but it is unclear if they can stop
Juan Miguel Gonzalez from taking his child home to Cuba during that
time. If the court refuses to hear the appeal, the relatives would
has 90 days to appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The court said that when the application for asylum was filed,
the Immigration and Naturalization Service had no policy ``to deal
with extraordinary circumstances'' of a relative filing on behalf
of a minor child against a parent's wishes. But INS has since
developed a policy, and it was entitled to do that, the judges said
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the duty of the Congress and the executive branch to
exercise political will,'' the ruling said. ``Although courts
should not be unquestioning, we should respect the other branch's
policymaking powers. The judicial power is a limited power. It is
the duty of the judicial branch not to exercise political will, but
only to render judicial judgment under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, press secretary for Vice President Al Gore, said
that Gore ``has long believed the case should have been handled in
family court. However, we should respect the decision rendered by
the appellate court.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane made the comment after Gore visited the AFLAC Cancer at
Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service spokeswoman Maria Cardona
said ``preliminarily, through press reports, it looks good, but we
need time to review the whole decison before we go any further.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional saga of Elian has been building since
Thanksgiving, when the young castaway was plucked from the Atlantic
Ocean where he had been drifting in an inner tube after he, his
mother and other fugitives from Cuba capsized.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez; his cousin, Marisleysis
Gonzalez, and other relatives in Miami took him in soon after his
rescue. An international custody battle for the boy soon began with
the relatives insisting that Elian would fare better if they raised
him since his mother was among those who drowned trying to escape
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   For more than five months, the relatives refused to give up
Elian until federal agents came into Lazaro Gonzalez's home before
dawn April 22, the day before Easter, and whisked him away to
Washington where his father, stepmother and baby brother were
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his family have been in the Washington area since
then, because the courts have said they could not leave until
courts ruled on the asylum issue. Playmates have been brought from
Cuba to be with Elian while he waited.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez filed the petition for political asylum for
Elian, who could not read or write when the request was made. The
relatives argued that if the little boy were returned to Cuba,
Elian's beliefs about the United States will be ``purged'' by the
Marxist government and he would become a ``traumatized'' child.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law grants special status to Cubans in that they can stay
in this country once they are on ``dry land.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, attorneys for the Immigration
and Naturalization Service and the boy's father have argued that
Juan Miguel Gonzalez is a loving parent and only he should decide
what is best for his son, who is too young to make those kind of
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Juan Miguel Gonzalez) knows this child better than anyone
in this courtroom, or anyone else on the face of this planet .. .
There is a real family here,'' attorney Gregory Craig told a
three-judge panel _ Judges J.L. Edmondson of Atlanta, Joel Dubina
of Montgomery and Charles Wilson of Tampa _ during arguments in
Atlanta last month.
</P>
<P>
   The court had promised a quick decision, which came three weeks
to the day after the arguments appealing a lower court decision.

INSTANT-MESSAGING STAKES RISING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Hyatt Harborside Hotel is an easy cab ride from
Logan Airport. The place offers a picturesque view of Boston Harbor
and the city's skyline. The hotel even boasts a water taxi to ferry
guests downtown in Venetian comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Hyatt Harborside holds little appeal for the executives
of America Online Inc. None of them came to the Instant Messaging
2000 conference held here this week. Too bad. The other guests
would have welcomed AOL _ as a luncheon entree.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is by far the world leader in instant messaging, the
Internet service that lets people fire off snippets of chat to each
other. The company's Instant Messenger and Iservices have about 120
million users between them, giving AOL as big a monopoly in instant
messaging as Microsoft Corp. has in desktop operating systems.
Upstarts like Odigo and CMGI Inc.'s Tribal Voice barely register on
radar.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine MCI telling its customers that they could only place
calls to other MCI subscribers. That's how AOL does instant
messaging. Its two services are incompatible with everybody else's.
That means that a user of, say, CMGI Inc.'s Tribal Voice service,
can't send messages to users of AOL Instant Messenger or ICQ.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Engineering Task Force, one of the online world's
self-regulatory bodies, is working on a global messaging standard
that'll eliminate compatibility problems. AOL has said that it will
embrace such a standard _ one of these days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rival companies have sometimes tailored their
software to work with AOL's, but when they do, AOL rewrites its
code so the other messaging software no longer works. The company
says that allowing access by non-AOL message systems compromises
the security of the AOL network.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Pulver, whose company runs the conference, has a more
cynical explanation _ it's AOL's monopoly and it's sticking to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at them more like the old Russia, where they rule with
an iron fist,'' Pulver says.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal Voice has asked the Federal Communications Commission to
intervene in the planned merger between AOL and Time Warner Inc.
The company's goal is to force AOL to open up its system now. Given
the outrage over Time Warner's idiotic decision to block ABC
Television Network programs from its cable TV systems, federal
regulators are already taking a hard look at this merger. The cries
of the instant messengers may fall on attentive ears.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are getting higher, because instant messaging isn't
just for love-struck high schoolers. Microsoft Corp. and IBM
Corp.'s Lotus Development Corp. unit are building instant messaging
into corporate software to allow teams of workers to keep track of
each other and their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Today there's little corporate use of instant messaging, but
that's changing. It's not just the ability to fire off quick notes
that businesses crave. It's the ability to always know which
employees are plugged in.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging systems rely on a piece of client software
that connects to the Internet. This client sends a tiny burst of
data to a server, informing the network, ``He's here.'' The network
doesn't merely know how to reach you _ it knows you're actually
online at that moment, ready for action. It's as if your telephone
knew when you arrived home and notified all your relatives that you
were available to be pestered.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, telephones are the next frontier in instant messaging.
AOL and Tribal Voice are introducing systems that will ``know''
when you switch on your cell phone. As with today's instant
messaging software, you can make yourself invisible to the network,
or visible only to certain people. A colleague will be able to type
an instant message on his computer, and it'll appear on the phone's
display screen. Or he could phone you instead because the network
has shown him that you're accepting phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the lowbrow content of most instant message chats.
Instant messaging itself is a triumph of network intelligence.
Someday, all forms of electronic data _ Internet services, phone
calls, eventually even TV and radio _ could be based on the same
concept: customized data, served up by a network that knows us.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a big idea, I can't blame AOL for not wanting to
share. It's such a big idea that in the end, they'll have to.

E-BILLING SERVICES HAVE MANY PLUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I've been paying my bills electronically for several years using
Quicken. Now I'm hearing that it may be easier if I use an online
bill-paying service. Is this true, and if it is, which services are
the best?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Bill-paying services are springing up all over the Internet, and
some of them are pretty good. Among the best _ PayMyBills.com,
Statusfactory.com and Paytrust. All of them alert you when your
bills are due and give you the option of paying them automatically.
You can view bills from the past year online. And they let you
download records of your transactions into Quicken or Microsoft
Money. Expect to pay about $9 a month for up to 25 payments.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth switching from the bill-paying system you already
have? Maybe not. If you're satisfied with your Quicken service, it
might be best to stick with it. Same thing goes if you pay bills on
the Internet directly through your bank. But if you like the idea
of total automation, an online service could be just the thing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Linux Suites Available
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm really tempted to give Linux a shot (I have an older PC
that's just sitting around that I could install it on). The
question is, are there any decent applications yet for Linux? I'd
like to do word processing and use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: There are at least three office suites now available for Linux _
WordPerfect Office 2000, Applixware Office and StarOffice. All
include the usual office-suite components like a word processor,
spreadsheet and presentation program. The only real difference _
WordPerfect and Applixware will cost you (under $100 each), while
StarOffice is offered free from Sun Microsystems, which acquired
its maker last summer.
</P>
<P>
   I've been test driving a Windows version of StarOffice, and it's
pretty cool. Not as robust as Microsoft Office, but the word
processor is just dandy. You can open and save files in Microsoft
Word format, which lets you exchange documents with other Word
users. And, the best part _ it's free.
</P>
<P>
   For Web surfing, you'll need a Linux-based browser, and here
again you can get a good one gratis. Netscape offers a free Linux
version of its Communicator at www.netscape.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Pick Hard Drive by Price
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm considering getting a second hard drive for my PC. Is there
anything else besides price to consider when shopping for one?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Some drives run faster than others _ 7,200 rpm vs. 5,400 rpm,
for instance. But today's hard drives are so fast that performance
differences for common tasks are minor. And don't worry about brand
names, because any hard drive designed for a Windows PC should work
in your system.
</P>
<P>
   So, yeah, the only real consideration should be price. And
prices for hard drives have never been lower. In fact, CompUSA this
week is advertising a 20-gigabyte drive for $130.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Icons Are Movable
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: In Windows is there a way I can place the desktop icons wherever
I want and have them stay there? Right now, every time I try to
move an icon it pops back into position like a buck private bucking
for a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Your problem is that your system is using Windows' Auto Arrange
feature, which puts all the icons in nice, tidy columns. But it's
an easy problem to fix. Just right-click any empty area of the
desktop, point to Arrange Icons and click Auto Arrange to deselect
it. Then you can put your icons anywhere you want.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ADDRESS UPDATE: Several readers wrote in with an easier way to
clear the Location bar list in Netscape than the procedure I
described last week. Choose Preferences from the Edit menu, click
the Navigator category, and click Clear Location Bar at the bottom
of the window.
</P>
<P>
   One reader also suggested a free program called Communicator
Clear, which can automatically erase your Netscape history list,
cache files, location bar list, and cookie files each time you exit
your browser. You can download it at www.hotfiles.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Ever worked on a really long document in Microsoft Word and
become frustrated when you had to scroll up and down to see
different parts of it? Try splitting the Word window in two. There
are a couple of ways to do this. Here's one: With your document
open, go to the Window menu and choose Split. Then drag the
demarcation line to where you want it and click to set it. This
will give you upper and lower windows, both of which contain your
document. You can scroll the windows individually. What's more, you
can edit the document in either window. Cool? You bet.

THE CHALLENGE FOR MICROSOFT IS IN MIDDLEWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government's antitrust suit against Microsoft has provided
plenty of surprises the last two years. But surely one of its most
remarkable byproducts is that a nerdish bit of computer plumbing
called middleware has emerged as the star of the case and a focus
of public-policy debate in the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   In his legal ruling last month, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
had no doubts about what so frightened Microsoft that it repeatedly
violated the nation's antitrust laws. ``Middleware,'' he wrote,
``threatened to demolish Microsoft's coveted monopoly power.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the Justice Department and states suing Microsoft
called earlier this month for the company to be split in two, the
rationale for such a harsh remedy was largely to make the world
safe for middleware _ a layer of software that acts as a technology
translator between the basic computer operating system and the
various applications programs that people use to carry out tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft,'' the government declared, ``has repeatedly, and in
a variety of ways, used the monopoly power of its operating systems
to prevent the development, distribution and success of middleware
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson may well issue his remedies order later this week _
probably approving the government's call for a breakup, antitrust
experts say. Anticipating that, Microsoft on Friday postponed a
gathering of news media and industry analysts that had been
scheduled for this Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the event, rescheduled for June 22, the company was to detail
its technology plans for the next few years, including an
initiative called ``Next Generation Windows Services.'' To its
critics, the Microsoft effort appears to be intended to fold more
Internet software into its industry-standard Windows operating
system. And such a move, they say, would be a rerun of the tactics
the government cited in asking for a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft,'' the government said, ``has combined the software
code of separate middleware products with the code of its monopoly
operating system _ again with the purpose and effect of foreclosing
customer choice and excluding competition.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Microsoft, the middleware declarations of Judge Jackson
and the government reflect a puzzling inability of those in
Washington to comprehend the software business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government,'' Microsoft wrote in reply, ``seeks to
regulate Microsoft's inclusion of any `middleware' in Windows _ a
term the government defines so broadly as to include virtually
 &UR; any &LR;  feature Microsoft might add to its operating systems.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is' all the fuss about anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Middleware, a layer of software residing above the operating
system that applications can run on, has been around since the
mainframe days. But it has taken on a far more significant role in
recent years because of the Internet and the rise of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike desktop computing, which Microsoft dominates through its
Windows operating system, Internet computing is based on open
communications standards that are not owned or controlled by any
single software maker.
</P>
<P>
   As electronic commerce spreads, more and more companies are
writing Internet applications _ for sharing data, handling
transactions and so on _ that are written to run on top of a layer
of middleware. Because middleware runs on a variety of operating
systems, programmers can write a single version of an application,
rather than having to write various versions for different
operating systems, like Windows and Unix.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is a diverse, global network, and middleware can
serve as the translator that enables the different dialects of
computing to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these distributed Internet applications increase, so does
the use of middleware,'' said Dan Kusnetzky, an analyst at the
International Data Corp., a research firm. ``And that makes
operating systems less and less important.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Raduchel, the chief technology officer of America Online,
observed, ``Almost all the new applications in computing are being
written above the operating system. The challenge in software now
is to write for the middleware.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet middleware business is growing fast, but still in
its infancy. There are perhaps 200 suppliers. International Data
estimated middleware sales at $2.77 billion last year, up 66
percent from two years earlier. Both growth and consolidation are
predicted for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big battle of this decade is going to be in middleware,
not operating systems,'' said John Swainson, a general manager in
IBM's software group.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, not surprisingly, views things quite differently.
``We focus on the platform _ the set of technologies and services
that software developers need to write programs,'' said Tod
Nielsen, vice president of Microsoft's platform group. ``Drawing a
distinction between the operating system and middleware isn't
something we necessarily do.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's platform group is creating the so-called Next
Generation Windows Services. Many of the details are not known, but
generally it is an effort to have software developers write the new
wave of Internet applications to run on Microsoft's layer of
software instead of on middleware provided by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   One Microsoft executive explained, ``Think of these new Windows
services as API's for the Internet.'' API's, or application program
interfaces, are the software hooks to which programmers must tailor
their applications if they are to run smoothly. In the government's
antitrust suit, the Windows API's were portrayed as a key
instrument of the company's control of the industry _ enabling
Microsoft to withhold or delay rivals' access to that technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet middleware could allow software developers to write
for the middleware API's instead of Windows API's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's monopoly is particularly threatened by the
development of `cross-platform middleware' _ software that exposes
API's that are not controlled by Microsoft and that could be
accessed using a wide range of operating systems,'' Rebecca
Henderson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Sloan School of Management, wrote in a brief on behalf
of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft views its Internet initiative as repeating its past
behavior, but in a very different light than its critics. Just as
Windows took care of the innards of personal computing, Microsoft
executives say they want to perform a similar role with Internet
software. ``Software developers want a solid foundation, so they
can write value-added products, not plumbing,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   To Microsoft, the Next Generation Windows Services program could
supply that ``solid foundation'' for the Internet. And the project,
Microsoft protested in a court filing last week, ``will be doomed
to failure at the outset if Microsoft is split along the arbitrary
lines proposed by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   In the more closed environment of the personal computer
business, of course, no company benefited as much as Microsoft,
since it owned the industry-standard technology. With the open
technology standards of the Internet, however, Microsoft will face
a very different business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Next Generation Windows Services is part of the
repositioning of the company to compete in this evolving Internet
world,'' said Ted Schadler, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc.
``But it's not the PC model. No one can own the standards, and
Microsoft knows that. If they're not open, they're toast.''

DON'T EXPECT RAPID CONVERGENCE OF INTERNET, PHONE, VIDEO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANA POINT, Calif. _ For all of the buzzwords in the technology
industry, perhaps none is invoked as blindly, reflexively and
totemically as ``convergence.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk to a senior technology executive these days and you will
probably hear about how television, the telephone system and the
Internet are converging to create an interactive world of
information and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, convergence is not really happening, at least not
yet. And when it does, it will probably take forms much different
than those generally envisioned today.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a conclusion a visitor might have expected to bring
away from the annual Vortex conference that ended on Friday here on
the Pacific Coast. Vortex is about convergence, and it may be North
America's most concentrated gathering of top communications
investors and executives. But according to an automated polling
service at the conference, Vortex attendees gave convergence an
overall letter grade of D-plus for now.
</P>
<P>
   They recognize that even though billions of dollars are being
spent on convergence, immense obstacles remain. And in the end,
convergence will be far less than universal.
</P>
<P>
   At the first Vortex conference two years ago, the mood about
convergence was positively giddy. ``Two years ago here I remember
people looking at the new carriers, the Qwests and Level 3's, and
thinking that they were just going to make convergence happen,''
said a senior technical executive for a regional communications
carrier. ``I think what's impressing me this year is a new sense of
maturity _ sobriety even.''
</P>
<P>
   A 21-percent drop in the Nasdaq will sober up just about anyone
in the technology business. And it has. But beyond the financial
picture, the emerging sense of realism about convergence seems
based on a simple and renewed appreciation of the mundane technical
obstacles that stand in its way, and on some newly creative
thinking about what sorts of services will best embody it.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, convergence is the last mile. That sounds obvious,
but the last few years, at least some technology pundits,
executives and investors have drooled over the exponential
increases in bandwidth capacity in the nation's long-distance fiber
optic networks and mistaken that for convergence.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of the leaps in long-haul capacity, no more than 2
percent of the nation's 100 million or so homes currently log on
the Internet with anything more powerful than an analog modem. The
last mile of the nation's communications networks _ or the first
mile, depending on who's holding the mouse _ is the part that
actually touches homes. But this crucial link has not kept pace
with the rest of the network.
</P>
<P>
   The digital subscriber line technology that local phone
companies want to use to deliver torrents of Internet data over
traditional copper phone lines has had a particularly tough time
living up to expectations. DSL is far more difficult to put in
place than was originally thought. And the bandwidth, or speed, it
delivers is far less than was first contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, when many of the nation's leading computer,
software and local communications companies formed an alliance to
support DSL, they thought it would generally deliver 1.5 million
digital bits per second to consumers' homes. Today, it is unlikely
that more than a quarter of the few hundred thousand residences
with working DSL are consistently receiving more than a million
bits, or a megabit, per second. Industry experts say that most DSL
users probably receive only about 500,000 bits per second, at best.
Cable modems, the main alternative to DSL, more frequently deliver
megabit-plus speeds, but in some ways those communications pathways
are less reliable than DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even 500,000 bits per second is still an order of
magnitude faster than the 53,000 or so bits per second that can be
delivered by today's fastest analog modems. But consider that a
single channel of TV-quality video, using compression technology,
requires at least 2 million bits per second and often requires more
than 5 million bits per second; it becomes quite clear that for the
majority of consumers, television as they know it is not going to
be converging with the Internet soon.
</P>
<P>
   But then, merging TV with the Internet is probably the wrong
goal, anyway. Television is a one-way, centrally created and
distributed medium. It is not the killer application for the
Internet because the Internet does not operate like TV.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, most demonstrations of converged applications that
include video, including those at Vortex, are essentially
television with some interactive buttons, like ``buy now,'' or
``chat about this program,'' tacked on the side of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trap is when people think about this new media strictly in
the context of the old,'' said Michael O'Dell, chief scientist for
Worldcom's Uunet division, the No. 1 Internet carrier. ``I have a
problem believing that the future of the Internet is a bad version
of cable TV.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, Pushpendra Mohta, until recently one of
AT&AMP;T's top Internet engineers and now entrepreneur-in-residence at
the venture capital firm Benchmark Capital, shared an analogy he
picked up at a conference on wireless data services: ``If you are
used to shipping stuff by boat and all of a sudden you get access
to an airplane,'' he said, ``you don't put the boat on the airplane
and fly the boat to your destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than take the form of merely repackaged traditional
media, the most successful converged services will probably be cut
wholly from new cloth to take advantage of the specific
characteristics of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, the service that allows users to swap digital music
files, is a perfect example. And some technology experts believe
that Napster is already consuming more of the Internet's bandwidth
than the leading Web portal, Yahoo! Rather than simply selling
compact discs online or streaming radio stations _ the audio
equivalent of adding a ``chat now'' button to a TV program _ the
nature of Napster's service emerged from the Internet. In fact,
Vinod Khosla, the venture capitalist from Kleiner Perkins Caufield
&AMP; Byers, said trying to repackage traditional media online was
actually hindering the deployment of broadband communications and
converged services in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're trying to migrate old services to a new medium,
the barriers are high and the payoffs aren't that great,'' Khosla
said. ``But when you have a new service, maybe the barrier is high
but I'll climb over it because the payoff is higher.''

THERE IS SOMETHING SO FAMILIAR ABOUT SUMMER MOVIE WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (Eds: Matthew Mirapaul writes the arts(at)large column, published
each Thursday in CyberTimes on The New York Times on the Web.) 
 By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL   
 C.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The film industry loves the familiarity of sequels, so it won't
spoil the ending of this column to reveal that the Web sites for
this year's roster of potential summer box-office blockbusters are
mostly formulaic rehashes of past sites.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the site for ``The Blair Witch Project'' seemed to
signal a turning point. By supplementing the movie's
faux-documentary footage with additional online ``evidence,'' the
filmmakers simultaneously built an audience for their low-budget
flick and showed Hollywood's new-media mavens that a successful
site didn't have to be a bland bouillabaisse of canned production
notes, fuzzy video clips and simple games.
</P>
<P>
   But a tour of the promotional sites for some recently released
or soon-to-open movies often felt like ``Nightmare on HTML Street
5'' _ it might have been horrifying if we hadn't seen it all
before.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if memory serves, the sites for ``Mission: Impossible
2'' (www.missionimpossible.com) and ``Nutty Professor II: The
Klumps'' (www.nuttyprofessor.com) are remarkably similar to _ and
just as routine as _ the ones developed for their cinematic
antecedents in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Producers who say their budgets are ``all on the screen'' don't
mean the computer monitor. Given that Hollywood spends millions of
dollars on spectacular computer-generated special effects to
attract summer crowds, some of that digital creativity might be
expected to trickle down to the Internet. But except for the
widespread use of animated pages requiring the Flash software
plug-in, the multimedia possibilities of the Internet seem to be
lost on the industry's high-technology wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Only one site, for ``The Cell'' (www.thecell.com), a movie set
for release in August, provides a compelling online experience.
Instead of relying on film stills and video clips, the site conveys
the grim thriller's sick but stylish sensibility through a series
of elaborate, effectively creepy animations. These are augmented by
a database of information on serial killers and an interactive
psychology test that seeks to draw visitors into the film's story _
the tale of a psychologically disturbed killer who drowns his
female victims before mutilating the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere among movie sites, this kind of immersed content is
hard to find. In the past, sites for films like ``Twister'' and
``Contact'' supplied all sorts of topical information and
scientific background designed to support their cinematic version
of reality.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few current sites that take such pains is the one for
``The Perfect Storm,'' (www.perfectstorm.com) which provides enough
context that it might actually encourage online visitors to shut
off their computers and head for the movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   The site is easy to navigate and overflowing with multimedia
features, including home video clips of the northeaster that
walloped Gloucester, Mass., in 1991 and supplies the drama for the
film's story. There also is a 14-minute documentary on residents
who survived the real storm, as well as a series of video clips
about the film's special effects.
</P>
<P>
   So the site for Disney's ``Dinosaur''
(http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/dinosaur) should be swamped
with Mesozoic material, right? Strangely, no. The skimpy site
highlights the digital cartoon's scaly characters and supplies a
few rudimentary examples of animation, but it stomps on an
opportunity to educate young visitors about the pleasures of
paleontology.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site for ``The Patriot'' (www.thepatriot.com) is all too
typical of the genre, with biographies of the cast and crew, a copy
of the trailer and a bunch of photos and drawings.
</P>
<P>
   A Revolutionary War chronology is short on historical detail and
pointlessly interactive. And the loopiest element is a discussion
area that implies that Internet taxation might be a revolutionary
cause, though it is unlikely that people will start tossing their
personal computers into Boston Harbor anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even more meandering is the ``Gladiator''
(http://gladiator-thefilm.com) site. Its circular interface _ meant
no doubt to resemble the Coliseum in Rome _ was a constant battle
to navigate. And to access special areas of the site, visitors must
first traverse it and collect 40 different ``virtues,'' including
``changability'' and ``deceipt'' (but not ``spelling'').
</P>
<P>
   One final note: The ``Mission: Impossible 2'' site requires
visitors to submit e-mail addresses to enter certain areas, but
registrants then receive unsolicited promotional messages. Perhaps
the plot of ``Mission: Impossible 3'' will be about the worldwide
effort to end spam.

DIGITAL DARWINISM THINS THE SPECIES OF ONLINE TOY AND CRAFT 
STORES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Lord seemed in remarkably good spirits last Tuesday _
considering that a day earlier, Lord, chief executive of the online
toy retailer Toysmart.com, had announced he was closing the company
and laying off its 170 employees. ``We all knew there'd be a
shakeout this quarter,'' Lord said, then laughed. ``We just didn't
think it would include us.''
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart, a unit of Walt Disney based in Waltham, Mass., was one
of three Internet retailers to cry uncle last week. CraftShop.com,
one of the earliest online craft stores, filed for bankruptcy
protection last Monday, having ceased operations earlier this
month. And Brandwise.com, a joint venture between Hearst and
Whirlpool, ceased operations last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The previous week, Boo.com, an Internet sportswear merchant in
London with a global sales operation and about $135 million in
financing, announced that it was liquidating.
</P>
<P>
   Although other e-tailers have quietly suspended operations this
year _ Viacom's online toy store, RedRocket.com, and Cybershop.com,
a gift shop, are but two examples _ the recent shutdowns have been
the most visible e-commerce casualties to date.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus within the Internet industry is that more closings
will follow quickly, as investors continue to turn a cold shoulder
to Web merchants that burned through the venture financing they
received last year. But analysts disagree about the meaning of the
recent closings.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the shakeout represents a healthy dose of
digital Darwinism _ the market's acknowledgment that it does not
need dozens of online toy sites or craft stores, when just a few
will do. But other analysts suggest that as investors continue
their wholesale rejection of consumer e-commerce companies, they
may be condemning some companies that deserve a better fate.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the chief executives of Boo, Toysmart and
CraftShop said they, too, deserved better. But they also
acknowledged committing crucial mistakes that led to their demise _
mistakes they said they were determined not to repeat in their next
e-commerce endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Lord said one of the first e-mail messages he received after
announcing his company's shutdown came from a venture capitalist.
``It was one of those I-told-you-sos; I knew it was coming,'' Lord
said, declining to identify the note's sender. ``He offered me $25
million last year, and I turned him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord said he had rejected the deal because he believed at the
time that he had a better offer on the table _ an investment of
roughly $45 million from Disney, which included $20 million in cash
and the rest in advertising across Disney's media properties.
</P>
<P>
   In that deal, which was announced in August, Disney secured a
controlling interest in Toysmart. In turn, Toysmart got an
enthusiastic supporter in Chuck Davis, who was then the president
of e-commerce for the Buena Vista Internet Group, the unit that
oversees Disney's Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, Lord said, the Disney alignment caused
Toysmart's demise. ``They're a great company,'' he said. ``It just
operates on a different timetable. And when time is running out,
you don't want to operate on a slow timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   Practically speaking, time ran out on Toysmart at the end of
last year, when the stock market began to flee Internet retailers
en masse, before Lord could take Toysmart public. Toysmart had
spent $20 million on holiday marketing, and with the capital
markets closed, the company's prospects dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Because Disney works more slowly than venture capitalists, Lord
said, ``the deal cost us four months.'' And with that time, he
said, the company might have been able to go public before the
window for stock offerings in e-tailers slammed shut.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's initial ardor for Toysmart had faded after Davis left
Buena Vista late last year for another Internet company,
Bizrate.com, which rates online retailers. Then, two months ago,
Disney announced that its Internet focus had shifted from commerce
to entertainment and leisure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly knew it wasn't good for us,'' Lord said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If corporations call me now to come lead their dot-com, I'll
think about what would happen if, two years down the road, the
strategy changed,'' he said. ``Or if it takes six months to fund
instead of three. It's all about time. Time, time, time.''
</P>
<P>
   For Boo, time was one of many enemies. The European fashion
e-tailer had ambitious plans to sell luxury sportswear brands in 18
nations through one of the most technologically sophisticated Web
sites available in e-commerce. And it raised about $135 million for
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Boo.com site opened in November, five months behind
schedule, the company had already spent tens of millions of dollars
on marketing in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The late start hurt in several ways, according to Ernst
Malmsten, Boo's chief executive. Because the marketing had created
huge expectations, particularly in Britain and on the Continent,
the company was unable to test the site with a quiet rollout, in
which traffic builds gradually and kinks can be worked out before
visitors start showing up in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Boo.com had a decidedly noisy introduction, which led
to a chorus of journalists complaining that features like 3-D
photography and a talking saleswoman left those Internet users who
have slow modem connections _ the majority of users, in other words
_ waiting endlessly for pages to load. The company added a
low-bandwidth feature in February, to make the site work faster for
the modemed masses. But by that time many of the consumers Boo had
reached with its advertising campaign had visited, and sworn off,
the site.
</P>
<P>
   Boo's staff, meanwhile, had grown to about 400 people, who
worked feverishly to support a complex sales-fulfillment operation
that allowed users to see only the items that Boo's distributors
had in stock, in their preferred language, with prices in their
nation's currency. One Boo executive estimated that the
nonmarketing costs associated with building its global operation
were $50 million to $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   Malmsten said that aside from coordinating the site's rollout
with its marketing _ and perhaps waiting until shoppers were more
comfortable buying apparel online _ he should have tried to
restrain the expectations raised by the company. ``But we all make
lots of mistakes all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie of CraftShop had more modest goals for his site _ and
more modest financing to go with it. He said he had raised $3
million to $5 million for the site, which went online in January.
But he, too, was a victim of bad timing and less-than-perfect
execution. The company originally sought to open the site before
Christmas but failed because the technology was not ready; nor were
there photographs of the 40,000 or so craft products the site sold.
</P>
<P>
   When the site did get up and running, Mackie said, it was not
even close to meeting its sales goals, in part because it converted
less than 1 percent of its visitors into buyers. ``We didn't have
our merchandising department fleshed out,'' he said, ``so we didn't
do a very good job of merchandising.''
</P>
<P>
   Because CraftShop's investors, including the venture firm CMGI,
tied their financing to performance, the company did not receive
the bulk of a $15 million pledge earlier this year. By that time,
other venture capitalists were far too leery of e-tailing to come
to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   One final lesson for CraftShop, which may hold some truth for
the broader e-commerce market, was that the investors' timetable
may not coincide with the demands of customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when we got our early angel financing in March '99 that
we were probably too late,'' Mackie said. ``People were already
beginning to ask the hard questions about performance. But if we'd
been earlier, the craft shoppers wouldn't have been ready, willing
and able. The marketplace is just now warming up to this.''

STARMEDIA FACES NEW CHALLENGES IN LATIN AMERICA

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ When rumors circulated last month that the
American company StarMedia Network might be acquired by Terra
Networks, the Internet industry found the story plausible.
</P>
<P>
   After all, StarMedia, based in New York, had one of last year's
hot Internet stock offerings but had seen its shares fall from the
firmament. And its Web portal, which since 1996 had been the
premier gateway to material on the Internet in Spanish and
Portuguese, was facing increased competition in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure has come from both local and international
multimedia giants _ like Terra, which is owned by Spain's largest
telecommunications company, Telefonica. Terra, in fact, had already
bought up a handful of Internet service providers in Latin America
to challenge StarMedia as the region's biggest player.
</P>
<P>
   But Terra was weak on content _ the news, information and
entertainment that is StarMedia's specialty. So on the face of it,
a deal made sense even if StarMedia continued to insist that it was
holding no talks with Terra.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, StarMedia's denials were genuine. Two weeks
ago, Terra did make a content play _ a $12.5 billion deal to buy
Lycos, an American Web portal with international reach. So now,
rather than having a partner, StarMedia must contemplate an even
bigger, more powerful rival in the Latin American Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   StarMedia's charismatic 33-year-old founder and chief executive,
Fernando J. Espuelas, is not one to voice anxiety, though. In Sao
Paulo recently for the introduction of the company's redesigned
portal, StarMedia 6.0, he brushed off worries of growing
competition in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our leadership to lose, and we are not going to lose
it,'' said Espuelas, a native of Uruguay who speaks English like an
unusually articulate American. ``Not because we are preordained to
win, because nobody is. But we move very fast. We know this
business very well. It is the only thing that we do, and we did our
homework. We built a brand when those companies didn't believe in
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite its early leadership in the Latin American market,
the uncertainties are mounting for StarMedia. In the last year,
huge international players like Terra and America Online have made
Latin America's growing Internet market a major priority. And many
of the region's dominant media and telecommunication companies are
also devoting huge resources to building up Internet businesses.
Some analysts say StarMedia no longer has what it takes to compete
alone in the new highly competitive Latin American Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   ``What looks on the basis of 1999 numbers as a commanding lead,
will, on 2000 numbers, look like StarMedia is one of many rather
than a clear leader,'' said Lars Schonander, a media analyst for
the investment bank ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   And investors are hardly sanguine about StarMedia's stance.
After Espuelas announced in March that the company would confront
its growing competition by increasing its marketing spending by $12
million in the first half of the year, the stock plummeted 33
percent in one day.
</P>
<P>
   Even before that announcement, StarMedia was well off its high
of $70, reached last July, six weeks after its public offering.
Recently, with the oscillations in the Nasdaq market, the stock has
fallen even more, closing at $15.0625 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, StarMedia had seemed to lead a charmed
existence. Espuelas met the company's co-founder, Jack Chen, in the
sixth grade. Both of their families had recently immigrated to
Greenwich, Conn.; Espuelas' was from Uruguay, and Chen's was from
China. As children, they took English classes together. As
teen-agers, they jointly won a high school debate championship.
</P>
<P>
   While still in his 20s, Espuelas took a vacation in the Nepalese
Himalayas. It was there that he visualized what would become the
underlying goal of StarMedia: to knock down cultural barriers in
Latin America through universal Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole cliche about why would an Argentine care about a
Chilean is just not true,'' he said. ``It is part of the same type
of propaganda that has been fed to us for 200 years about why there
should be separate countries. Now, we are faced with a generation
in Latin America in which 60 or 65 percent of the people are
younger than 24 years of age. This is truly the Internet generation
and this generation will grow with a completely different set of
experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Espuelas quit his job as managing director for
marketing for AT&AMP;T's Latin American operations. Along with Chen,
who was by then a Wall Street investment banker, he moved back to
Connecticut to start StarMedia out of the Chen family's house.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the success of Yahoo in the United States, the two men
designed StarMedia as a so-called content aggregator. StarMedia
would build a gateway to various Spanish- and Portuguese-language
Web sites rather than go through the costly process of creating its
own sites. At the time, Latin America was barely on the Internet
radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   StarMedia used a storm of local television commercials to make
itself a household name in the region. And while Latin America's
nascent Internet service providers struggled to build the network
capacity to meet the budding demand for Internet access, StarMedia
was busy gathering Spanish- and Portuguese-language content sites
to give the new Web surfers places to surf.
</P>
<P>
   Multinational advertisers gravitated toward StarMedia on the
strength of its brand and the conviction of its chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Espuelas' leadership is considered one of the driving forces
behind the company's early success, and a reason why its stock was
initially so popular with investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you meet Fernando, it is kind of love at first sight,''
said Susan Segal, general partner at Chase Capital Partners, who,
along with Fred Wilson, managing partner at Flatiron Partners, put
up the initial $3.5 million in seed financing for StarMedia in
1997. ``He and Jack are a very charismatic management team.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, StarMedia captured $80 million in its third
round of financing, the largest equity investment in a private
Internet company up to that time. The celebrity from that
investment, in turn, helped the company raise $110 million in its
May 1999 initial public offering. All told, StarMedia has raised
almost half a billion dollars in the public and private markets.
</P>
<P>
   The company has put some of the money to use by buying Brazil's
leading Internet search services, Zeek and Cade, and a handful of
other Internet properties around the region to add to StarMedia's
basic chat rooms and free e-mail service. New wireless and
broadband-network units have been started to enable StarMedia to
expand its audience to users of cell phones and high-speed cable
modems.
</P>
<P>
   And the company's hefty marketing budget has helped it to become
the Latin American leader in Internet advertising revenue _ $10
million in this year's first quarter. That outpaced Terra and the
region's other publicly traded Web company, El Sitio.
</P>
<P>
   But StarMedia's first-starter advantages are quickly fading. In
Mexico, StarMedia's strongest market, local competition is heating
up. Telefonos de Mexico, the country's largest telecommunications
company, has teamed up with Microsoft to start a portal and
Internet access service called T1MSN.com. And two big Mexican media
companies, Grupo Televisa (EsMas.com) and Televisa Azteca
(todito.com), have also recently started Web portals.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, StarMedia has preferred to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 200 strategic relationships with content providers
across the globe, which we think adds infinitely more value that
having one big-name relationship,'' Espuelas said. ``I think that
is something that is not really understood in Latin America, which
has such an historic bias toward these big media monopolies.''
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts expect Latin America to mirror Internet
development in Europe, where big telecommunications and media
companies dominate the Web scene.
</P>
<P>
   StarMedia's experience in Brazil, Latin America's most promising
Internet market, provides a telling example of the challenges it
faces.
</P>
<P>
   Here, where fewer than 7 million people out of a population of
165 million are online, and forecasts call for perhaps an
additional 2 million people to get Internet access this year,
StarMedia had a weak start. The company's underlying concept of a
borderless pan-Latin community did not play well with the
Portuguese-speaking Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with StarMedia is that it always tried to head the
Latin American market, but Brazilians don't think that they are
Latin,'' said Alvaro de Castro, new business director at the
Internet consulting company Visualcom and author of books on
e-commerce and e-marketing in Brazil. ``When Brazilians entered the
StarMedia.com Web site and were asked to select what country they
were from off of a list, they would say: What are we doing among
all those other countries?''
</P>
<P>
   While StarMedia was busy rethinking its Brazilian strategy,
local companies were making inroads into the market. Universo
Online, or UOL, a joint venture of two Sao Paulo newspaper and
magazine publishing giants, the Folha Group and Editora Abril,
began providing Internet access and set up a comprehensive portal
with content supplied by its parent companies. More important, UOL
mounted a formidable advertising campaign using its parents' own
media outlets, which include Sao Paulo's leading newspaper, Folha
de Sao Paulo, and Brazil's leading weekly news magazine, Veja.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's first quarter, UOL said it logged 2.9 billion
page views. Compared with StarMedia's 2.1 billion views, that would
place UOL firmly in the lead among the region's Internet companies.
But StarMedia contends that UOL's figures, which are audited by
Ernst &AMP; Young in Sao Paulo, would not hold up under the scrutiny of
the Internet traffic auditor ABC Interactive, an American company
that StarMedia says is the measurement standard.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, StarMedia had some success in giving its Brazilian
site a more authentically local feel. The redesigned portal,
StarMedia 6.0, takes Brazilian Web surfers directly to local news
and issues. The company also introduced a new television and print
advertising campaign that featured a local soap opera star.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the first mover, StarMedia still occupies a lot of space in
the market,'' said Marcos Moraes, founder of Zip.net in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, where a dozen portals vie for a limited audience,
consolidation is soon expected to reduce the number of players to
perhaps three or four. In competing to be one of the survivors,
StarMedia's main rivals will be UOL, the Brazilian media power
Globo, Terra/Lycos, Zip.net/PT Multimedia and AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressures, a group of Internet access providers
shocked the market last December by offering free dial-up service
in Brazil. Independent service providers, which used to feed
traffic to StarMedia because they lacked content of their own, may
now be forced to join with portals to compensate for their lost
revenue streams.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the portals has any idea what will be at the end of
this race,'' said Jack London, a Brazilian who founded Booknet, an
online bookseller, and other Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
   But Espuelas contends that the strength of StarMedia's content
will draw new users to its site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The explosion of free ISPs in Brazil is a wonderful thing,''
Espuelas said, referring to Internet service providers. ``It is
lowering costs, bringing more people online. We want to create the
same dynamic in all of the major markets by essentially demolishing
the paid ISP model.''

   AFTER REDESIGN, SALON DISCOVERS ONLINE READERS ARE OPPOSED TO
CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   Internet users are accustomed to, and typically embrace,
rapid-fire change. But some types of change can make Internet users
downright grumpy, as the online magazine Salon recently learned.
</P>
<P>
   Salon introduced a redesigned site (www.salon.com) last Monday.
It did not take long before critiques started pouring in by e-mail
from hundreds of readers: The site had technical bugs; it was too
cluttered; its new, smaller type font was too hard to read.
</P>
<P>
   Salon's editor, David Talbot, responded on Wednesday with a ``We
feel your pain'' letter to the site's readers. The note said Salon
was tinkering with the site to fix the bugs and to address concerns
about the font size.
</P>
<P>
   But Salon's readers are not the only audience that matters.
Talbot said in an interview that one reason for the redesign was to
give more prominent placement to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers pay the freight here,'' he said, adding that
readers need to understand that the advertising revenue makes it
unnecessary to charge subscription fees for the site. ``We have to
make more room for sponsorship.''
</P>
<P>
   A second business reality, Talbot said, is that the new design
will make it easier to find room for continuous breaking news. He
said Salon was moving away from a magazine format and into that of
a ``continuously published newspaper,'' including the use of news
agency reports.
</P>
<P>
   That vision may initially meet resistance from some of Salon's 3
million monthly visitors, Talbot acknowledged. But he said that in
the long run, Web publications that survive must take advantage of
the speed and immediacy of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot said he was not overly concerned about last week's reader
complaints, noting that readers also protested last year when the
site had a less ambitious revamping.
</P>
<P>
   Readers are now arguing to keep some of the same features they
vehemently objected to when they were added last year. ``I'm
actually flattered by how passionately and seriously people regard
Salon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ MATT RICHTEL
</P>
<P>
   As Web Expands, Search Engines Puff to Keep Up
</P>
<P>
   Pity the poor search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Two Dartmouth College computer researchers have measured how
quickly the World Wide Web is expanding, and their findings are not
good news for the companies that are trying to index the hundreds
of millions of documents that are linked by the Web.
</P>
<P>
   To keep reasonably current, say within a week, a search engine _
or Web-searching service _ now needs a communications pipeline
capable of carrying 50 million bits of data a second. That is the
conclusion of George Cybenko, a Dartmouth computer scientist and
the co-author of a study of the changing Web. He said such a fast
communications pipe is required if a search engine's so-called
spider software is going to scurry about the Web with sufficient
swiftness as it looks for new documents and any other changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to determine that one in five Web pages is 12
days old or younger,'' said Brian E. Brewington, the co-author of
the paper with Cybenko.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers sampled more than 2 million of the estimated 800
million Web pages over seven months.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting picture is of an increasingly dynamic Web of
documents that will become increasingly difficult for search engine
companies to keep track of _ particularly as new software formats
like XML, or Extensible Markup Language, alter the now relatively
static world of Web documents.
</P>
<P>
   Brewington and Cybenko said their study might have already
struck a raw nerve in the world of search engines. When they
presented their comparative findings showing how up to date various
search engines were at a recent Internet conference, he raised
hackles among some search engine executives whose sites appeared
not to be as current as others.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason Brewington said he was not willing to make his
data public, acknowledging that any rankings would shift, depending
on when the survey took place. He said that most people do not
expect search engines to be absolutely up to date and that a fair
criterion might be having a search service that is within a month
of being current.
</P>
<P>
   For all the changes, the researchers noted that many parts of
the Web are quite static. One in four Web pages is more than a year
old, they found.

 &HT;    Nothing but the truth of contrite reviewer
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Comes now the plaintiff, J.G. Warner, who makes these
representations to this honorable court:
</P>
<P>
   1. Plaintiff states that on or about April 5, 2000,
representatives of Plantronics, a California firm, sent him one of
the company's Model CT10 cordless headset telephones to use in the
hope he would review it in his newspaper column.
</P>
<P>
   2. After using the Model CT10, and carefully studying the user's
manual (Exhibit A) included with it, plaintiff did write a review
of the CT10 which was published on or about May 14.
</P>
<P>
   3. While using the Model CT10, plaintiff noted that if the
telephone box was clipped to the user's belt as instructed, the
telephone's keypad was upside down. Before mentioning this in his
review, he again carefully perused the manual (Exhibit A) for some
explanation. Finding none, plaintiff mentioned this in his review
(Exhibit B), writing that the keypad was upside down for ``reasons
that escape me.''
</P>
<P>
   4. On May 16, plaintiff received an electronic communication
(Exhibit C) from a reader who stated: ``The phone clips upside down
so that when you look down to dial, it appears right side up.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Plaintiff was made to feel slow-witted and stupid, and his
reputation as a wide-awake newspaper columnist was severely
tarnished, as a result of his failure to note this fact in his
review of the Model CT10. Plaintiff submits that Plantronics is the
proximate cause of his emotional and professional agony, because it
failed to explain its purpose for the upside-down dialpad in the
instruction manual (Exhibit A).
</P>
<P>
   6. Defendant will no doubt suggest that had Plaintiff clipped
the box to his belt, he would have needed no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Such a defense would be meritless, however, since Plaintiff is
one of a large class of potential users of the Model CT10 unable to
see their belts due to overlapping anatomical projections.
</P>
<P>
   7. Plaintiff states his mortification is so great that no amount
of monetary damages could allay it. Instead, he prays this
honorable court will punish defendant, so as to deter any future
attempts to embarrass reviewers of its products, by making its
executives spend an hour a day for one week dialing 900 numbers on
their CT10s while taking tango lessons.

 &HT;    Virtual dressing room
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I just tried on a gazillion swimsuits without leaving
my home or removing a stitch of clothing. There were no fluorescent
lights, no tattletale three-way mirrors and no snide saleswomen
saying, ``You are going to try on that?''
</P>
<P>
   It's every woman's clothing dream and it's available courtesy of
the Internet. Now, there's finally a really good reason for owning
a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual dressing rooms are just beginning to make their way onto
the Web. With them, you can try on clothes on a virtual body that
looks like yours. Then you can buy what you see without ever having
to go to a mall.
</P>
<P>
   It's incredibly cool.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest name in the business right now is Land's End where
you start out by creating ``your personal model.'' You can use the
quick way or the detailed questionnaire to create an online version
of you.
</P>
<P>
   With the quick version, you enter a few general specifications
like waist (well-defined? not so well-defined?), shoulders (broad?
narrow?), hair color, hairstyle and the shape of your face.
</P>
<P>
   With the detailed version you have to dig out a tape measure,
supplying precise measurements (to the 1/8 of an inch) about
everything from your bust and your height to your hips and your
waist.
</P>
<P>
   Next you give your virtual self a name (I chose Monique), hit
the Frankenstein-ish ``build my model'' button and within moments a
replica of you is on your screen. Then you start trying on stuff.
</P>
<P>
   I (I mean Monique) was trying on things I'd never think about
toting into a dressing room. How did I know I wouldn't look good in
a tankini if I didn't try one on, after all?
</P>
<P>
   You choose the item and the color and watch what your virtual
image looks like in the clothes you pick. You can spin your model
around to look at yourself in profile or from the rear. There are
added benefits like recommended outfits and style advice tailored
to your appearance and measurements (or at least what you said were
your measurements).
</P>
<P>
   I immediately became a huge fan because ``Monique'' was offered
such gushing advice as, ``You can add variety to your wardrobe
because you look good in everything.'' Obviously wrong but
incredibly good for the ego.
</P>
<P>
   While Land's End is the only major clothing retailer with a
virtual ``you'' for trying on virtual clothes, some companies are
experimenting with other cyberhelp.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently at Eddie Bauer's online site, there was a virtual
dressing room that allowed you to put garments together to see how
they look. You visualized an outfit to make sure that top really
went with those pants before you pulled out your charge card. (This
virtual dressing room is currently being tinkered with but is
expected to be back online _ new and improved _ by late summer.)
</P>
<P>
   A New York-based company is trying to take this virtual dressing
room a much bigger step forward.
</P>
<P>
   At yourfit.com, you will create a virtual you where you'll be
able to try on clothes from various online retailers. You visit an
online store, then click a button to try on the items in your
shopping cart. You are then whisked away to youfit.com where you
enter your measurements (or refer to the measurements you already
have on file) and a virtual you gets to try on before you buy.
</P>
<P>
   Company founder Steve Ross spent years in the catalog industry,
where he said at least a third of all returns were because clothes
didn't fit right.
</P>
<P>
   When you first visit the site, you enter general measurements
that you'll probably know off the top of your head (height, weight,
waist, etc.). You'll then be given a choice of three images that
meet those measurements. You pick the one that looks most like you
and you're off.
</P>
<P>
   Then, once you register, you'll receive a tape measure in the
mail along with detailed instructions on how to take various body
measurements. You can go back to your virtual image and keep adding
measurements, making the model look more and more like you.
</P>
<P>
   Yourfit.com will debut in early August on various online
retailer sites. The company is currently negotiating with major
names like J. Crew and LL Bean, says Ross. The immediate plans are
for only a female model since women do 60 percent of all e-commerce
apparel buying, says Ross. The company hopes to release a male
version early next year. (Though you can't really experience
yourfit.com yet, you can visit the Web site for a pretty cool
sample demonstration.)
</P>
<P>
   A San Diego company, e.fitting, plans on introducing similar
products.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, it will debut Fitting Wizard where you enter
your measurements to find out what size you should wear at various
retailers. A size 6 at Old Navy might be an 8 at Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in June, e.fitting introduces Mirror Please, where you
scan in a photo of yourself, then see a two-dimensional ``you''
trying on clothes from different online retailers. (Do those pants
from J Crew really go with that shirt from Eddie Bauer?)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, later this year, e.fitting plans on releasing
Bodybuilder, a 3-D body model that lets you try on clothes from all
over the Web. All three products will be available as free
downloadable software at the company's Web site, www.e-fitting.com.
</P>
<P>
   But clothes aren't the only thing you can customize online.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a virtual makeup counter to save trips to a
cosmetics department. At Reflect.com, you can have beauty products
custom-created just for you by entering your beauty vital
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of a lengthy process with layers upon layers of
questions about everything from the clothes you like to wear to the
color of your eyes. Some queries were simple: Ethnic background,
hair color. Others were a little more thought-provoking like the
Barbara Walters-esque ``If I were a house, I would be?'' (I
struggled between a maintenance-free condo and a ranch in the
country.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you've checked all the boxes, you can jump to hair care,
cosmetics or skin care to find individual products. The items are
mixed up especially for you _ with catchy names like BR255 _ then
shipped to your door. During the process you even get to choose the
design on the package.
</P>
<P>
   I opted for squiggles. I think they'll go best with my tankini.

 &HT;    INVITING TOURISTS TO BORDER ``HUNTS'' FOR HUMANS IS NOTHING
NEW(a) 
 &HT;    (RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED THIS)(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By DANIEL GONZALEZ(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tourists as soldiers of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   That was the gist of an anonymous appeal that surfaced last
month: Fun in the Arizona sun. The great outdoors. The chance to
help ranchers hunt illegal immigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't the first time the idea of hunting humans for
sport has cropped up in Douglas, a border town known for mining,
ranching - and now, illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years ago, a similar proposal to tourists was pitched in
this same corner of Arizona. But rather than Mexicans, it was
Apache Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Fimbres Apache Expedition is not only a
reminder of the long-standing racial hostilities along the
Arizona-Mexico border, but it's also a tragic lesson about
vigilantism.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1930 and Douglas, the hub of the nation's copper-smelting
industry, was in an economic slump. The Great Depression was
underway and all the economic indicators pointed downward.
</P>
<P>
   The town's merchants, however, were pioneering people. If
ranching was slow and copper mining on the wane, they would find
some other way to generate money.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But not just any kind. A.C. Karger, then mayor of Douglas, and
the shrewd chiefs of the local Chamber of Commerce were going to
sell a special brand of tourism, one that capitalized on every
attribute Douglas had to offer: a magnificent railroad station,
excellent rail connections, a world-class hotel, a warm, dry
climate with blue skies and breathtaking scenery.
</P>
<P>
   And the chance to kill Apaches, although that was never overtly
stated in the fliers and newspaper ads promoting the expedition
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose of the expedition was the attempted rescue of
a 7-year-old boy who had been kidnapped by a band of Apaches three
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the underlying message was not lost on the outpouring of
men who wrote letters hoping to join the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never fought Indians, but I have chased Spics all
around Haiti and Nicaragua,'' wrote one adventure-seeker. ``I guess
I'll have the guts to chase these birds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have traveled all over the globe. I have seen a bit of life
and have fought men of all colors, so I would like to become a
member of your expedition, for I love action,'' wrote another.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition stemmed from years of hostilities
between a Mexican rancher named Francisco Fimbres and a band of
Apaches based in the rugged Sierra Madres.
</P>
<P>
   Although warfare between the Indians and the United States
officially ended with Geronimo's surrender on Sept. 6, 1886,
hostilities with his band of Apaches - the Bronco group of the
Chiricahua - continued on both sides of the Mexican border for
another 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The hostilities exploded into open warfare on Oct. 26, 1926 when
the Apaches ambushed Fimbres and his family. The Apaches killed
Fimbres' wife and kidnapped his son, Geraldo. The Apaches were
seeking revenge for an earlier kidnapping of Geronimo's
great-granddaughter by Fimbres.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition captured nationwide attention, but
in the end the expedition never got off the ground. Officials on
both sides of the border realized the idea of armed gringos roaming
around in Mexico could spell disaster and they quashed the
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop Fimbres. When he learned help from the gringos
was not coming, he reverted to his old tactics. With the help of
vaqueros (Mexican cowboys) and expatriate American mercenaries,
Fimbres hunted down the Apaches himself. A March 13, 1931, photo
captured Fimbres with the scalps of three Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Fimbres finally found his son in an Apache
camp, hanging from a tree. In revenge for the three Apaches killed
earlier by Fimbres and his men, the Apaches had swung the boy by
his heels and smashed his skull against an oak tree.
</P>
<P>
   Fimbres and his men retaliated yet again, until the last of the
Apaches were hunted down and killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition was chronicled in a 1993 book,
``They Never Surrendered: Bronco Apaches of the Sierra Madres,
1890-1935,'' by Texas author Douglas Meed.
</P>
<P>
   Meed sees a parallel between the Fimbres expedition and a
``Neighborhood Ranch Watch'' flier distributed in April that hoped
to convert tourists into soldiers of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a parallel there, because what you are doing is
asking people to come down and hunt people as sport,'' Meed said.
``The difference is that the ranchers are trying to protect their
land rather than make money off this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meed also thinks the most recent episode could spark a new round
of violence along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix writer John Alba came across accounts of the Fimbres
Apache Expedition while researching a novel set during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   He also sees a link between the two calls for vigilantism along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a parallel there as to how some Anglo people view
dark-skinned people as less than human,'' Alba said. ``At that
time, in the 1930s, it was the Apaches who were viewed as animals
to be hunted down and exterminated. Now it's common to hear in
various places along the border these expressions that the illegals
are a plague, a vermin, an invasion that has to be stopped.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 &HT;    Web now the best place to get shareware, freeware
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most of us have sampled e-commerce by now, and the
idea of buying something online is no longer strange or
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   But long before there were dot-coms offering items for sale, the
Internet _ and computer Bulletin Board Systems before that _ had
strange little storefronts where the merchandise was free for the
taking.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, shareware and freeware programs were mostly
found on CompuServe, Prodigy and AOL. That was before these
services became gateways to the Internet. Whether you were looking
for a game or a word processor or a spreadsheet program, it was
pretty easy to find a free or inexpensive one to download and use.
</P>
<P>
   That's still true. It's just that now, the Web is the best place
to find these programs. We'll look at some of the places where
they're available today. But before we start that, you need to
understand the two terms: shareware and freeware. The two types of
programs have a lot in common.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, instead of being sold in stores, they're mostly
distributed online. That means that people who can't afford to
start a company and sell commercial software can create programs
and distribute them with no marketing or manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Shareware is a type of program that you use on a free trial
basis. After using it, if you like it, you're supposed to send a
payment. If you don't like it, you simply delete the program and no
money is owed. Freeware is as you'd figure, software that is
distributed with no payment owed. You'll find both types of
programs on the sites we visit today.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop is www.shareware.com. It's one of the best places
to start. Simply use the opening page just as you would a
conventional search engine such as Yahoo. Fill in the search terms
that describe the program you seek. You'll also need to use the
pull-down menu to tell the search engine the type of operating
system you are using: Windows, Macintosh, Linux, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've filled in all the blanks, the page will search out
software that seems to fit your criteria. Once you find a program
that you want to try, double click on it, and it'll download
automatically to your computer's hard disk. Almost all these
programs are made so that they'll extract and install automatically
_ again you just need to double click on the file you downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, you'll need programs that are used to extract the
files for you. If that's the case, you'll be told about how to
download of copy of that extraction program.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds unwieldy and complicated, read the help sections
you'll find on all these pages. You'll get instructions on how
things work in much more detail than can be offered here.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you know how these sites work _ and all of them work in
an almost identical way _ we can cover ground faster.
</P>
<P>
   The next site to check is Tucows and is at www.tucows.com. This
is a site that specializes in the kind of programs you need to use
the Internet efficiently. You'll find the obvious here: browsers,
newsgroup readers, e-mail programs, FTP (file transfer protocol
programs, used to send and receive files over the Internet) and
tiny utility programs that can tune up your online connection to
make it more efficient. There are also some very specialized
Internet programs here, things that most of us don't need.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things about this particular site is that _ when
you log on to it _ you are able to select a computer server in your
own area from a list. That means that the downloads generally will
go faster and that there isn't the sort of online congestion you'd
find if one server was trying to handle the load.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites for downloads include, but aren't limited to,
download.cnet.com/, www.softseek.com/ and www
</P>
<P>
   .planetclick.com/cgi-bin/category
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Growth of online grocery services says something about our
society
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The city of Atlanta is under siege. Invading armies of
vans and trucks are everywhere, driving up and down our streets,
stopping at any house that will let them in, bribing our children
with Pokemon cards and us with fresh produce and free delivery.
Like they say on ``Star Trek,'' ``Resistance is futile.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is the invasion of the online grocery stores. WebVan
(www.webvan.com) has already marched through town and HomeGrocer
(www.homegrocer.com) will follow on June 14. The addition of
HomeGrocer will make Atlanta one of the few two-online grocery
towns in America. (Three, if you count online convenience store
Kozmo.com.) We only have one newspaper but a variety of online
delivery services. We can get stamps, Starbucks, Krispy Kremes and
cola delivered right to our homes with a click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Take that, New York.
</P>
<P>
   Surely Atlanta's wealth of online delivery services says
something about the changing world we live in. It probably says
something deep and profound about the increasing impact of the
Internet on daily lives. It also probably speaks volumes about the
increasing number of ordinary people using the Internet to
accomplish the routine tasks of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly I think it says people are tired of lugging cases of
soda and 10-pound bags of cat box litter out of the grocery store,
into their cars and then into their homes. Why spend your precious
spare time waiting in milelong checkout lines and then dragging
groceries around in those paper-thin plastic bags, when some
pleasant grocery courier will happily do it for you, refuse to take
tips and charm the kids with pockets full of goodies.
</P>
<P>
   You can't swing a cat in metro Atlanta without seeing a WebVan
truck on its way to or from some household that's probably giddy
with excitement that the grocery guys are coming.
</P>
<P>
   Our grandmothers used to have groceries delivered, too, but it
was never front-page news. But remember, for a generation that
lives with do-it-yourself checkout lines, automatic bank tellers
and self-service gas stations, ordering groceries online and having
them brought to your door whenever you want and deposited exactly
where you want seems downright revolutionary. Online grocery
shoppers are more than eager to tell you about their adventures.
</P>
<P>
   They do it with a mix of awe and wonder that makes old-fashioned
grocery shoppers want to log on and order a loaf of bread, some
peanut butter, three oranges and a box of cornflakes _ even if they
don't need any.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at WebVan and HomeGrocer both say a little competition
in the online grocery business is a good thing for everybody. They
claim it will help people to think of alternative ways to shop for
groceries. WebVan spokesman Bud Greeby says just because we've been
shopping at the supermarket for decades doesn't mean it's the best
way to shop for groceries. He could be right and he could be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Our fascination with online grocery shopping could be a fad that
will fade once the novelty of it all wears off. Or it could be a
huge hit with time-crunched families who still have to pick up dry
cleaning they dropped off three months ago, never mind find time to
get to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, even the most computer-phobic people in town are
putting WebVan through its paces. Business is so brisk, the company
has literally run out of trucks and is using plain old unmarked
trucks to make deliveries. This is not to say that WebVan is
problem-free.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery areas are determined by ZIP code, and residents in
several suburbs both north and south of the city report heated
online and offline debates with WebVan representatives insisting
they do live where they say they live. While the selection is
extensive, you get every last box of cereal or flavor of ice cream.
And as addicted as we may become to online grocery shopping, there
will always be those double coupon days at the local market when
boneless chicken breasts are on sale for 99 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes online shopping doesn't make sense, and stopping off
for a bottle of milk on the way home actually is easier than online
ordering. But of course, 20-pound bags of dog food are another
story altogether as any pet owner will tell you.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of a WebVan truck or a UPS delivery man hopping out
of his truck with a pile of boxes that have the Amazon.com logo
stamped all over it speaks volumes for how wired a city and its
residents are. Those trucks mean that somebody inside the houses
they're headed for has computers or access to a computer and is
using them to make purchases to save time, to save money or just
because they think it's fun.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a Harris Poll or a batch of Internet pundits to
tell you the Internet is everywhere. Just keep an eye out for those
online delivery trucks.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   As a revamp of a bona fide classic, Excitebike 64 ($60;
www.nintendo.com; for Nintendo 64) faithfully pays tribute to its
heritage while bringing the simple side-scrolling dirt bike game up
to speed with the 3-D gaming era. Not to be confused with a
sophisticated motocross simulation, Excitebike 64 is all about
mud-mucking motocross mayhem while suspending disbelief. A great
selection of decently animated bikes and riders, each with specific
strength and weakness, race around more than 20 handsomely designed
indoor and outdoor tracks. As with the original, the excitable
bikes come equipped with a finite amount of ``turbo,'' which will
overheat and stall a motor if overused, making for some
strategically selected high-speed overthrusting. Aside from
farcical lateral control during ``Whaaahooo!'' airtime, Excitebike
does have a fairly accurate physics model that offers enough
realism within its larger-than-life premise to make it the best
``arcade'' dirt bike racer to be found on the N64.
</P>
<P>
   Are you the kind of acquisitive, collective person who proudly
displays ``complete sets?'' Do you scour every inch of game levels
seeking ``secrets?'' Do you count the cracks in the sidewalk and
make certain that at the end of each walk equal numbers of cracks
have been crossed with right and left feet? Do you think you're
clever? In short, Alundra 2 ($40; www.activision.com; for Sony
Playstation) takes obsessive-compulsive disorders, burns them onto
a Playstation disc, then spins them round and magnifies them to a
power of two. It's intricate and ornery, a puzzle-ridden
action/adventure role-playing game of ludicrous proportions.
There's no artificial intelligence to be seen as everything is
pattern based, but the sheer exploratory extremis gameplay should
keep any gamer into these sorts of games happy for a long, long,
long while.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Thief II: The Metal Age ($40, www. eidosinteractive.com; for
Windows PCs) tiptoes the same path as its predecessor, adding a
handful of new features but, for the most part, succeeding as an
expansion rather than a true sequel. The original first-person
sneaker, ``Thief: The Dark Project'' was the surprise breakthrough
hit of 1998, a thinking-person's shooter emphasizing stealth,
timing and cold calculation over brute force. As master thief
Garrett, you creep through the night, hiding in the shadows,
awaiting the proper moment to pick a pocket, dash into an alcove
or, if you must, strike a blow. The game's graphic engine hasn't
been updated, the enemies still tend to be blocky-looking and not
too bright, and there's no multiplayer game. Yet the sinister,
gloomy experience as a whole remains immersive, tense and fun.
Thief II offers new weapons, great voice acting and 3-D sound
effects, challenging new enemies, a variety of missions, plus 16
large, interesting and beautiful levels. It remains an innovative
concept and the new installment is a solid successor to the
groundbreaking original, worth many hours lurking in the shadows
and scurrying across the rooftops.

 &HT;    Lab tests supplements' content
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Though the world of natural supplements is confusing
and frequently contentious, it is home to a few advocates who are
consistently reliable, responsible and clear. One of the most
notable is Mark Blumenthal, founder and director of the American
Botanical Council, an independent nonprofit group, and editor of
the peer-reviewed journal HerbalGram.
</P>
<P>
   Now Blumenthal has lent his expertise to a new Web enterprise,
and it looks like a winner. Consumer Lab (www.consumerlab.com) is
conducting privately financed tests of vitamins, herbs and other
nutritional supplements to determine whether the content of the
products matches industry standards and the manufacturers' label
claims. Brands that hold up under scrutiny are listed on the site
and receive the right to display the trademarked CL seal.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the site has reviewed various brands of gingko biloba,
vitamin C, the antidepressant SAMe, the osteoarthritis supplements
glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, and the prostate support herb
saw palmetto. The findings are provocative: Significant numbers of
the supplements lacked key components or did not contain the
advertised percentages of active ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Chief personnel for Consumer Lab are William Obermeyer, formerly
a high-ranking natural products chemist with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, and Dr. Tod Cooperman, founder of a group that
rated consumer satisfaction with managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   This site is worth bookmarking.

 &HT;    Quick View offers virus protection
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Using one of the free services, I want to set up a Web site for
my civic organization from which just the 25 members might access
information, such as bylaws, meeting notices, minutes, etc. Who
offers these services?
</P>
<P>
   _ Cheryl Smith, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Sounds like what you need to do is set up an intranet. It's
a bit different from the Internet, which is a huge, global computer
network. An intranet is a space on the Web where a group can easily
access and share documents, calendars and information. Intranets
are usually password-protected, which gives your group control over
who has access to its information.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Give Intranets.com (intranets.com) and MSN.com
Communities (msn.com) a look-see. These intranet sites are FREE!
They'll help you every step of the way: From setting your site up
and designing it, to hosting and support.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Intranets.com is mostly geared toward small businesses, but
it could work for your organization too. They provide 25 megabytes
of space on their servers, you'll exist in their domain
(groupname(at)intranets.com), and you'll have control over who
visits your site. They offer scheduling, messaging, discussion,
document management, contact directory, instant messaging, news and
finance information. You can save files for others to download,
have a real-time conference with members of your group and use
e-mail to keep everyone in the loop on events.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: MSN Communities works like Intranets.com, except it is
geared more toward clubs, organizations, personal sites, photo
sites, family and communities. You'll exist in its domain, and each
member can have up to 30 megabytes of space. That's a good bit more
than Intranets.com. What's cool about MSN is that you can subscribe
to public community sites and see what everyone else is up to. But,
if you need privacy, you can create a private site. The public will
not be able to access your information. Access is by invitation
only.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Another way people are coming together is through community
Web sites. AtHomeNet.com, an Atlanta-based company, touts its
intranets for communities, associations and subdivisions. There is
no set-up or design fee. They do charge a monthly fee, depending on
the number of members.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: The idea is to improve and promote communication within
residential communities. You pretty much get the same features
we've described. The difference with AtHomeNet is that you can
purchase your own domain name. You can decide the exact name of
your intranet. For instance, if you live in a subdivision called
Cambridge Park, you could name your intranet cambridgepark.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Community intranets can display their own advertisements
ranging from home sales to finding a baby sitter. Ads can be
designated as public or private. We thought this was a great
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd write for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Girlhood glimpse of Margaret Mitchell
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 4.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was almost like discovering the secret diary of
Scarlett O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Jane Eskridge was helping her friend Wailes
Thomas clean out his mother's 60-year-old house in Atlanta when she
came across a crushed, cobweb-covered box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really hot, and we were exhausted, and the box was so
dilapidated, we almost tossed it,'' says Eskridge, 60, a middle
school teacher in Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I pulled out something that looked like an address book.
When I opened it up, on the inside flap it said Margaret Mitchell
and her address, and it was dated 1913. Then I saw there were three
story titles on the right, and when I flipped through it and
realized there were stories, I just screamed.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the box was empty, Eskridge had found two 1910
letters from Mitchell to her father from Summit, N.J.; four
handmade books written between 1912 and 1913; one untitled
shipwreck story; one untitled Civil War story and the beginning
chapters of another; two copybooks with a poem and seven stories, a
play, an essay, and eight journal entries written between 1915 and
1916.
</P>
<P>
   The stories, journals and musings were written by Mitchell on
dime-store notebooks from when she about 8 until she was 17. Since
most of Mitchell's papers were destroyed after her death, how these
writings survived is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The house once belonged to Thomas' late aunt, Margueryte
Reynolds Sharp, who was married to the brother-in-law of Mitchell's
brother, Stephens Mitchell. Apparently the notebooks were packed
with other books from Reynolds' library and lay undiscovered for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Eskridge's discovery is available to the public in an exhibit at
the Margaret Mitchell House and in a new book, ``Before Scarlett:
Girlhood Writings of Margaret Mitchell'' (Hill Street Press,
$21.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``This exhibit provides a unique opportunity in American
literature to trace the evolution of a writer who would later
capture the heart, soul and mind of people all over the world,''
says Mary Rose Taylor, executive director of the Margaret Mitchell
House &AMP; Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The writings reflect the major influence Mitchell's parents had
on her views of the world. Her mother was a leader in the women's
suffrage movement, and her father, who was president of the Georgia
Bar Association, campaigned for an appeal of Leo Frank's
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in that kind of activist environment led Mitchell to
favor heroines over heroes in her girlhood stories and ``to portray
characters possessed of the kind of strength and passion she saw in
her own parents,'' Taylor says.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Mitchell showed talent beyond her years. ``She was a
master of dialogue. The stories move right along with good
transition,'' Eskridge says.
</P>
<P>
   One story, ``Dan Morrison, A Spy for the Confederacy,'' reflects
Mitchell's early interest in the Civil War _ a fascination fueled
by the vivid tales she heard from Confederate veterans and from her
parents.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1936 letter to a friend, Mitchell wrote about visiting
relatives who had fought in the war. ``I sat on the bony knees of
veterans and the fat slippery laps of great-aunts and heard them
talk about ... how Grandpa Mitchell walked nearly fifty miles after
the Battle of Sharpsburg with his skull cracked in two places from
a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't talk of these happenings as history nor as
remarkable events, but just as part of their lives and not
especially epic parts. And they gradually became a part of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stories of shipwrecks and cowboys reveal Mitchell's wild
imagination and spirit of adventure. And, with the Mexican
Revolution and news of Pancho Villa's exploits fresh in her mind,
Mitchell wrote three Mexican stories. In one, the heroine is
kidnapped by rebels and rescued by a bold Mexican leader, a kind of
Rhett Butler with a Spanish accent.
</P>
<P>
   Eskridge, who wrote the introduction and explanatory material
for the book, says the collection sheds new light on Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides being fun to read,'' she says, ``these treasures from
Mitchell's childhood give new insight into the development of her
talents as a gifted writer and storyteller.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Before Scarlett''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy lay in the sand behind some mesquite bushes, hugging her
father's big rifle to her breast and watching Alvarado's men move
about in the house. Since the late hours of the night before she
had lain there and though now the early Mexican sun was burning her
blue eyes and blistering the little arms that so tightly held the
big gun, no thought of changing her position had entered her mind.
...
</P>
<P>
   She had been in the kitchen spreading sandwiches for Bob, Big
Sister's intended, when Alvarado and his bandits arrived, and the
trampling of hoofs, the noise, the loud voices had brought her to
the door of the living room just in time to see the coolly smiling
Mexican leader shoot down her father. Mother had screamed, thrown
herself beside him, only to receive Alvarado's second bullet.
</P>
<P>
   EXHIBIT
</P>
<P>
   Editor Jane Eskridge will be on hand for a reception at 7-9 p.m.
Wednesday at the Margaret Mitchell House &AMP; Museum, Peachtree and
10th streets. Reservations required. Call 770- 578-3502. Exhibit
will be open 9 a.m.-4 p.m. daily through Nov. 1. $10 for adults, $8
for seniors and students, $7 for children 6-11.

 &HT;    Get a leg up on the latest with hose that are a breeze to wear
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 4.
 &HT;    By Ginger McFarland and Subira Shaw
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After several seasons of stagnant sales, the hosiery industry is
snapping back. Fishnet stockings _ as well as patterned hosiery,
luxury sheers and colored hose _ are being featured prominently in
stores this spring. And retailers are predicting that by fall women
will be stocking up on styles that stand out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the fashion leaders begin showing their novelty hosiery,
it will trickle down to the consumer,'' said Joan Kaner, senior
vice president and fashion director for Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Top designers such as Miuccia Prada and Gucci's Tom Ford have
spring ad campaigns featuring seductive hosiery, and their message
has reached the street.
</P>
<P>
   Now women who wear fishnets may look out of the ordinary but not
necessarily out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen-year-old Rondi Scott of Norcross, Ga., typically
injects color into her black-on-black ensembles by wearing opaque
hose in bright shades like fuchsia beneath a pair of open-weave
black fishnets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an avid fishnet-wearer,'' said Scott, who's been sporting
them since she was 13. ``If you've got nice legs, fishnets show
them off a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   That layered look Scott likes to wear is ``the hottest look for
spring,'' according to Shannon Zirkle, who manages the Victoria's
Secret Hosiery Boutique at North Point Mall, Alpharetta, Ga. Zirkle
added: ``It's about expressing your fashion mood.''
</P>
<P>
   When she's in the mood to be noticed, 26-year-old Jessa Holz of
Duluth, Ga., shimmies into some fishnets as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're eye-catching,'' explained Holz, who's worn fishnets
for five years. ``People do double takes when I've got them on.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Holz pointed out, wearing fishnets has
weather-related advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like wearing air-conditioned hose,'' she said. ``The
holes in fishnets make them cooler than regular hose. You still get
the dressy look for a suit without being too hot.''

FREEBSD RIDES THE INTERNET WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HENRY NORR   
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Name an operating system that's distributed
free, maintained by a far-flung network of mostly unpaid
enthusiasts and relied upon by a growing number of Internet service
providers and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you guessed Linux.
</P>
<P>
   After all, that OS has become almost a household word in recent
years, as it has evolved from geek plaything to Internet workhorse
and even (until a few months ago) Wall Street darling.
</P>
<P>
   But Linux wasn't the first freely distributed OS, nor is it the
only one that's caught the Internet wave. An alternative called
FreeBSD and other members of the Unix-derived BSD family arguably
play a more central role on the Internet, even though the general
public has little awareness of them.
</P>
<P>
   The FreeBSD customer roster includes such Internet powerhouses
as Yahoo, the most heavily trafficked site on the Web; Microsoft's
Hotmail, the world's largest e-mail services; MCI WorldCom's UUNet,
a giant provider of Internet services to businesses and to consumer
ISPs; MindSpring, a national ISP that last year ranked No. 1 in
customer satisfaction according to J.D. Power and Associates; and
Verio, a company that says it hosts more than 300,000 Web sites in
170 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo has been relying on FreeBSD since 1995, according to
co-founder and Chief Yahoo David Filo. Today, the company has
``well over 1,000'' servers, and about 90 percent of them run the
free OS, he said; the only exceptions are machines Yahoo picked up
by acquiring other companies (most of which will be shifted to
FreeBSD eventually) and a handful running applications that require
other operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started,'' Filo explained, ``it offered more stability
and better performance than anything else we could find, and it's
continued to perform well in those two departments. It's a system
that has always worked for us, and it looks like it's only going to
get better over time.''
</P>
<P>
   So convinced of FreeBSD's merits are Filo and his fellow Yahoos
that they've recently put some of their riches behind an effort to
raise its previously modest profile. In March, Yahoo took an
unspecified equity stake in Berkeley Software Design Inc. (BSDI), a
Colorado Springs, Colo., company that markets a commercial version
of BSD called BSD/OS.
</P>
<P>
   The investment helped BSDI buy Walnut Creek CDROM, the leading
distributor of FreeBSD, and arrange another acquisition that will
be announced within six weeks, according to BSDI spokesman Kevin
Rose.
</P>
<P>
   While it will continue to improve and market its commercial OS,
the beefed-up company also has big plans for the free version: Like
Red Hat, Caldera Systems and other companies that have grown large
by providing added-value services to Linux customers, BSDI plans to
offer professional support, consulting and custom development for
users of FreeBSD.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-year-old company, which already has more than 100
employees and is profitable, also plans to raise additional funds
from venture capitalists to fuel its new ambitions, according to
Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Yahoo, the biggest feather in FreeBSD's cap has to be
Hotmail. After all, Microsoft touts its own heavy-duty OSes,
Windows NT and now Windows 2000, as alternatives to Unix, yet it
continues to rely on FreeBSD to manage the mail of Hotmail's 66
million users.
</P>
<P>
   In a revealing message explaining why it hasn't switched to its
home-grown systems, product manager Sarah Lefko said Microsoft is
``committed to providing a stable and high-quality user experience
for Hotmail.''
</P>
<P>
   While the company does plan to switch to Windows 2000 servers
eventually, Lefko noted that such a massive migration can't happen
``overnight.'' She didn't explain why the process hasn't even begun
yet, even though there have been approximately 880 ``overnights''
since the company acquired Hotmail at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Along with FreeBSD and the commercial BSD/OS, the family
includes two other major free versions, NetBSD and OpenBSD, plus
some smaller variants. No one knows for sure how many users the
free versions have, and Stephan Somogyi, a BSD watcher who works as
director of strategic development at a San Francisco startup called
Flying Packets, says, ``I'd distrust anyone who says they have hard
numbers,'' since users can make unlimited copies of the free
versions.
</P>
<P>
   BSDI, however, estimates that more than 100,000 commercial sites
run one or another BSD variant on some 2 million servers. A survey
of major national Internet carriers conducted last fall by
Infonetics, a San Jose, Calif., market research company, found that
roughly three-quarters of these companies' servers ran some form of
Unix, and of these, 15 percent used FreeBSD and 5 percent used the
commercial BSD/OS. By contrast, Sun's Solaris was installed on 45
percent of the Unix servers, but the much-hyped Linux had only a 9
percent share.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, by next fall, the companies Infonetics
surveyed expect to have Linux on 18 percent of their servers and
Solaris on 47 percent; FreeBSD's share is projected to drop to 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And a separate survey of smaller service providers, completed by
Infonetics in March, gave Linux a current share of 41 percent of
Unix servers, compared to 26 percent for Solaris, 15 percent for
the older, BSD-based SunOS, 8 percent for FreeBSD and 5 percent for
BSD/ OS. That study also projected that FreeBSD's share would
increase by a quarter, to 10 percent, over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The BSD camp will also get an indirect boost over the next year
as Apple rolls out its next-generation operating system, Mac OS X.
That product is derived from Steve Jobs' old NeXTstep system and,
like NeXTstep, it incorporates a ``layer''' of BSD software, mainly
from the FreeBSD version.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced that the BSD camp's prospects are
bright, considering the momentum and ``mind share'' Linux has
acquired and the marketing muscle Microsoft and Sun can put behind
their commercial offerings. Daniel Kusnetzky, vice president of
system software research at International Data Corp., is among the
skeptics. BSD's supporters, he said, ``really have a challenge
ahead of them,'' because their OS is largely unknown to the
information-technology staff at most corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't know about something,'' Kusnetzky said, ``they
won't consider it, and if they won't consider it, they won't buy
it.''
</P>
<P>
   BSDI's Rose, however, is undaunted. Comparing the BSD family to
Linux and even commercial competitors, he said, ``We think we have
a product that's more reliable, scalable and robust for
high-performance, infrastructure-grade computing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Filo agrees, noting that his company recently started
rolling out the latest version of FreeBSD, 4.0. Despite all the
competition it faces, he said, ``it seems to have plenty of
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Open source for us has been such a huge benefit, I can't
imagine us moving to a proprietary system,'' he said. ``The only
other alternative is Linux, and I don't see much reason to do that
at this point. As long as FreeBSD continues to give us what we
need, there's no reason to move.''

   Boston Tea Party
</P>
<P>
   ``Dump the tea! Into the sea!'' is the rallying cry aboard the
Brig Beaver II, a full-size working replica of one of the original
Tea Party ships. First, we gather for a Town Meeting where our
costumed guide teaches us how to be good rabble-rousers: We say
``Fie!'' and thrust our fists to the ground in opposition to taxes
and chant ``Hear! Hear!'' to call for revolt. All fired up, we
dress up as Indians (OK, we tucked a blue feather behind our ear)
and cheer as two volunteers heave rather ratty-looking bales of tea
overboard. OK, it's hokey, but lots of fun. And you really do learn
a lot about what happened on ``The Night of Decision'' _ Dec. 16,
1773. Be sure to visit the museum on the dock and have a cup of
tax-free hot tea on the house. $8; $4 children. Congress Street
Bridge. 617-338-1773; www.historictours.com.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Museum Boston
</P>
<P>
   Just across the Congress Street Bridge is a special place that
engages kids 10 and under with hands-on activities such as a
life-size boat and Kidstage, where kids can let their dramatic
streaks run wild. Fans of Arthur the aardvark will love ``Arthur's
World,'' where they can see themselves on TV. Just head toward the
giant wooden milk bottle _ a 40-foot-tall landmark that is actually
a snack bar. 10 a.m.-5 p.m. daily (until 9 p.m. Fridays). $7; $6
ages 2-15 and seniors; $2 for 1-year-olds; $1 for all 5-9 p.m.
Fridays. 617-426-8855; www.bostonkids.org.

<P>
   Boston Duck Tours
</P>
<P>
   You'll feel like a total quack rolling through Boston in a World
War II era amphibious landing vehicle. But you'll have a ball as we
did aboard the geranium pink ``duck'' Commonwealth Curley. Each
conDUCKtor (as they're called) assumes a comic persona. Ours is a
Tom Selleck lookalike who goes by ``Magnum DI.'' He wears a
Hawaiian shirt and lei and a Detroit Tigers baseball cap. His
tour-guide patter includes snippets of Boston history. When we pass
a certain point on Boylston Street in the Back Bay, he tells us we
can boast to our friends back home that we crossed the Boston
Marathon finish line. With a mighty blast of the horn, we splash
into the lower basin of the Charles River. Here, Magnum DI explains
how these vehicles were used in Okinawa and Sicily during wartime.
``Remember,'' he says, ``somebody died for us to take this silly
thing around the city.'' Tours leave daily from the Prudential
Center every half hour from 9 a.m. Buy tickets inside at Center
Court. $21; $18 students and seniors; $11 ages 4-12; 25 cents for
age 3 and under. 617-723-3825; www.bostonducktours.com.
</P>
<P>
   New England Aquarium
</P>
<P>
   Whale Watching Tour
</P>
<P>
   You're sure to have a whale of a time shouting ``Thar she
blows!'' as the great sea mammals surface and dive off the
Stellwagen Banks, the rich feeding grounds for whales, dolphins,
other marine life and sea birds about 20 miles offshore. The blue
and white catamaran Voyager III departed from the dock beside the
New England Aquarium (itself a great family attraction) at 10 a.m.
By 11:37, we had a sighting, the first of many during the 3
1/2-hour excursion. Our score card: 15 humpbacks, four finbacks,
one minke, one harbor porpoise and a seal. Granted, these were
fleeting glimpses _ but we did get at least one magnificent dive
that ended with the fluke, or tail, waving high above the surface.
10 a.m. weekdays and 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. through June; 9:30
a.m., 12:30 and 2:30 p.m. daily July 1-Sept. 4; 1 p.m. weekdays and
9:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Sept. 5-Oct. 9; and 10 a.m. weekends only
Oct. 14-Nov. 5. Call for special trip times July 7-16 during Sail
Boston 2000. $26.50; $21 college students and seniors over age 60;
$19 ages 2-18; $16.50 ages 3-11. Children under 3 not allowed.
Advance reservations recommended. 617-973-5281; www.neaq.org.
</P>
<P>
   Boston by Sea
</P>
<P>
   This lively cruise is more like a floating musical theater.
During a 90-minute harbor tour, Boston's maritime history comes
alive as costumed guides _ a bunch of old salts _ tell stories of
the sea and sing chanteys as you cruise among the harbor islands.
Tours at 1 and 3 p.m. daily through Oct. 9. 617-227-4321;
www.bostonharborcruises.com.
</P>
<P>
   Swan Boats
</P>
<P>
   Lazily circling the lagoon in the Public Garden at the blazing
speed of 2 mph in these pedal-powered craft has been a tradition
since 1877. Big Bertha, the oldest swan in the current fleet, has
been at it since 1918. The original boats carried only one person;
today's hold 20. 10 a.m.-4 p.m. daily through Sept. 10. $2, $1 ages
2-15. 617-522-1966.

   MINOR-COLUMN _ PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's admit it to ourselves
just for a moment. Private school. Are you thinking about it, too?
Jimmy Carter did it, and he has a good heart. So did Clinton,
although he is not exactly our yardstick for moral behavior. And
although I'm a liberal _ I like my son to go to school with
children who speak Spanish at home, children who have survived
divorce, children whose parents are from Romania and Cuba and Haiti
_ right now I'm sad and confused and scared. (Minor, Palm Beach
Post). MOVED

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ Dear Kasey: I can't believe it's already been
four years since your high school graduation. At this rate, I'll be
dead in no time. Now you're a college graduate with highest honors
from the University of Texas at Austin, the second generation of
our family to be an official Texas-Ex. The first generation, namely
me, didn't get any type of ``honor'' appellation next to the
diploma. I was just proud to eke out a master's degree in seven
years. (Gary Borders is editor and publisher of the Nacogdoches

   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Ricky McGinn was scheduled to
die Thursday. In 1995, McGinn, who had a record of sexual assault,
was convicted of murdering and raping his 12-year-old stepdaughter
in 1993. The evidence against McGinn was strong: blood on his car
that could have come from less than 1 percent of people other than
the victim, and hair that matched the victim's on an ax identified
as the murder weapon. McGinn's attorneys and death-penalty
opponents were pressing last-minute appeals to try to save him,
including pleas for new DNA tests they say could free him.

ASIA'S TYCOONS JOIN THE INTERNET RUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In this densely packed city, where property is the
coin of the realm, Raymond Kwok is as close as one gets to royalty.
</P>
<P>
   Kwok's 46th-floor office looks out on a forest of skyscrapers,
dozens of them built by his family. Across the harbor in Kowloon
are sawtooth rows of apartment houses, also built by the family.
The Kwoks' real estate empire is one of the largest in Asia, making
Raymond, 46, and his two brothers fabulously wealthy, even by Hong
Kong's baroque standards.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, Kwok is worried about something that has
little to do with concrete, glass and steel. ``We always follow
closely what is happening in the U.S.,'' he said. ``In America, we
see how technology is changing business, how technology is creating
a lot of new businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet sweeps across the Pacific, Kwok believes
technology will unleash the same frenzy of sudden wealth and
disorienting change in Asia. If his family wants to keep its place
among Hong Kong's commercial elite, he says, it must join the
revolution. So Kwok, a Harvard MBA, has devised one of the most
ambitious Internet strategies of any old-line Asian company,
creating a diverse portfolio of Internet start-ups related to his
family's business.
</P>
<P>
   The Kwoks are one of several families of Asian tycoons who are
determined not to be left behind. From Taiwan to Thailand, the
region's most powerful families have started a blizzard of online
ventures. Whether their core businesses are in property,
telecommunications or banking, Asia's tycoons are seizing on the
Internet in hopes of expanding their reach and making even more
money.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the Internet is transforming the way business is
done here and elsewhere in East Asia. With its emphasis on speed,
openness and collaboration, the Net is challenging traditional
Asian values of prudence and family control. Decisions, which used
to be made by the patriarch behind a veil of secrecy, are being
pushed down the ranks as Asian companies embrace Silicon
Valley-style management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The classic Asian family dynasty probably isn't the best
suited to succeed on the Internet,'' said Peter Yip, the chief
executive of Chinadotcom, one of Asia's first publicly traded
Internet companies. ``But I've been amazed by how quickly they've
learned the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so sanguine. Despite their chameleonlike
adaptability, Asia's tycoons may have trouble making the leap into
cyberspace, critics say. For the last quarter-century, the tycoons
rode a wave of double-digit growth. In countries like Indonesia,
Thailand and Malaysia, cozy ties with governments sheltered them
from market forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys think the Internet will bring them prosperity for
the next 25 years,'' said Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong publisher who is
putting his media properties online and starting an Internet
shop-from-home service. ``But to unlearn the lessons of the last 25
years is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Lai (pronounced lie) predicts, the culture of the
Internet will erode the dominance of family dynasties in Asian
commerce. By making information widely available, the Web will
gradually devalue the networks of personal contacts _ known in
Chinese as guanxi _ amassed over decades.
</P>
<P>
   Kwok, though, thinks he can ride the technology tidal wave. He
spent much of 1999 in the United States, roaming around conferences
and quizzing entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered some online businesses that play to the strengths
of property owners. One is providing specially outfitted office
space to house computer servers. Another is creating Internet
sites, including chat rooms and bulletin boards, for the residents
of the apartment complexes owned by the Kwok family's company, Sun
Hung Kai Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Kwok packaged his collection of start-ups into a holding
company, Sunevision, which went public on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange. While Kwok is the chairman, he has recruited an outside
executive to run it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind-set of a technology company is very different from a
property company,'' Kwok said. ``We needed to remove a lot of
baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jeffrey Koo Jr., the challenge was persuading his elders
that the Internet was more than a fad. Koo, 35, is a
fourth-generation member of a family that controls a vast empire in
banking, telecommunications, cement and cable television.
</P>
<P>
   In talking with classmates from the Wharton School in 1997, Koo
became convinced that his family had to lash its future to the
Internet. As president of the family's Chinatrust Commercial Bank,
Koo began taking baby steps online. But his father turned down his
first request for $10 million to finance an Internet service
provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father and his brothers were against me doing this because
they thought of it as a form of gambling,'' Koo said. ``When I
would talk excitedly about a new venture, they would look at me
blankly.''
</P>
<P>
   In Koo's case, the elders came around when Microsoft bought a 10
percent stake in his start-up, Gigamedia, a broadband entertainment
and information service. Earlier this year, Gigamedia became the
first Taiwan Internet company to go public on the Nasdaq exchange.
Although it was caught in Nasdaq's downdraft, it is still worth
well over $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Koo is developing online banking and a regional e-commerce
service to complement the family's 75 percent stake in Gigamedia.
Less than two years after his father gave the Internet the cold
shoulder, Jeffrey Jr. said, he now talks constantly about the
cyberworld.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To some students of Asian business, this is merely a new chapter
in an old story. Ethnic Chinese families have traditionally
prospered by adapting to new circumstances. Kwok Tak-seng, the
patriarch of the Kwok family, started as a trader in southern
China. By the 1950s, he had migrated to Hong Kong and become the
local agent for the YKK zipper company of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing more opportunity in property than zippers, Kwok began
building apartment houses. By the 1980s, he was a leading real
estate developer. Kwok died in 1990, but under his three sons, Sun
Hung Kai grew into a conglomerate with interests in toll roads,
cargo handling and mobile telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``One good thing about old-economy companies is that they have
profits and cash flow,'' said Raymond's older brother, Thomas, who
oversees Sun Hung Kai's real estate business. ``But old-economy
companies need new-economy ideas to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their rock-solid stature, however, Asia's tycoons face
challenges from a host of upstarts. Lai, the publisher and a
self-styled maverick, offers himself as an example. Last year, he
started a venture that lets customers order groceries and other
goods by phone or over the Internet. The company, adMart, delivers
from its warehouses, cutting out the middleman.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, the middleman for many of these goods is Li
Ka-shing, a billionaire who owns one of the two local supermarket
chains. When Lai's delivery business began to pinch Li's stores, he
canceled his company's advertising in Apple Daily and Next
magazine, the outspoken newspaper and weekly magazine at the heart
of Lai's company.
</P>
<P>
   For Lai, the lost revenue has hurt. But after years of tweaking
Hong Kong's establishment in his newspaper, Lai relishes mounting a
frontal assault on its most powerful local businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never take on Li Ka-shing before,'' Lai said. ``But if
I'm riding on the back of a huge market force like the Internet,
then even he can't stop me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the Internet is the second revolution to rumble
through Asia recently. In 1997 and 1998, the regional financial
crisis brought many family empires to the brink of ruin. Even in
Hong Kong, property prices plunged by more than half, and are only
now recovering.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, many Asian governments took steps to clean up
their banks, tighten commercial regulations and force companies to
improve their disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the crisis, Asian firms regarded financial disclosure
and minority shareholders as a necessary irritant,'' said Peter
Churchouse, the co-head of research at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in Hong Kong. ``Now they know they can't get away with that.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Asia's tycoons were humbled, the crisis did not dull
their entrepreneurial instincts. Watching start-ups like Amazon.com
and Ebay become sensations in America, the tycoons saw a chance to
make a quick score. Virtually every conglomerate rushed out an
Internet unit.
</P>
<P>
   Li Ka-shing started e-commerce ventures through his two
companies, Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Holdings. He also
backed a Chinese-language portal, Tom.com, which prompted a
near-riot among investors when it went public last February.
Tom.com tumbled in the global sell-off of technology stocks. But
thanks to Li's gold-plated reputation, it still trades above its
offering price.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to hand it to the conglomerates, they've maintained
their position in a radically different economy,'' said Mark Duff,
the founder and chief executive of Boom.com, an online
stock-trading company here.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Duff and other independent entrepreneurs fear that the
tycoons are colonizing Asia's cyberspace. They say that the family
companies can soak up money and talent that could have gone to more
daring ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the tycoon-backed ventures are often
unimaginative. Sunevision's concept of providing warehouses for Web
servers was pioneered in the United States by Exodus. Tom.com
promoted itself as a mega-portal for Chinese audiences around the
world. When it went public, its Web site consisted of a home page
and links that went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the initiatives in Asia are extremely shallow,'' Duff
said. ``But the brand names of the families are so strong that it
doesn't matter. They get funded.''
</P>
<P>
   A few executives are trying to force deeper changes in Asian
culture. Richard Li, the son of Li Ka-shing, is building an office
park here. The 64-acre complex, known as Cyberport, is supposed to
offer tenants like Microsoft, IBM and Softbank a campus-like
environment where ideas can be swapped and new businesses hatched.
</P>
<P>
   Just 33 years old, Li is the brashest Internet entrepreneur in
Hong Kong and a symbol of Asia's headlong flight into cyberspace.
His two-year-old company, Pacific Century Cyberworks, recently won
a $36 billion takeover battle for Hong Kong's main telephone
company. Li is also building a satellite-delivered Internet
service.
</P>
<P>
   Li epitomizes the contradiction in Asia's version of the
Internet. A scion of the Li dynasty, he has created a cyber-age
company crackling with the energy of employees hoping to strike it
rich on stock options. The company's latest conquest has been
likened to America Online's acquisition of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Li would never have triumphed unless the Bank of China
arranged a $12 billion syndicated loan to finance the deal. And
analysts agree that Li would never have landed such a loan without
his father's connections.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise with the Cyberport. It may plant the seed for a fertile
technology culture in Hong Kong. Yet rivals of the Li family have
criticized the project because it was awarded to Pacific Century by
the Hong Kong government in a back-room deal.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the tycoons stop short of extolling Asian values,
but they make no apologies for their privileges. ``There's a blend
of Western and Asian elements here,'' said Alex Arena, Li's top
lieutenant. ``It's not a question of being like the U.S. It's a
question of cherry-picking from the U.S.''

   MINOR-COLUMN _ PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's admit it to ourselves
just for a moment. Private school. Are you thinking about it, too?
Jimmy Carter did it, and he has a good heart. So did Clinton,
although he is not exactly our yardstick for moral behavior. And
although I'm a liberal _ I like my son to go to school with
children who speak Spanish at home, children who have survived
divorce, children whose parents are from Romania and Cuba and Haiti
_ right now I'm sad and confused and scared. (Minor, Palm Beach
Post). MOVED

<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ Dear Kasey: I can't believe it's already been
four years since your high school graduation. At this rate, I'll be
dead in no time. Now you're a college graduate with highest honors
from the University of Texas at Austin, the second generation of
our family to be an official Texas-Ex. The first generation, namely
me, didn't get any type of ``honor'' appellation next to the
diploma. I was just proud to eke out a master's degree in seven
years. (Gary Borders is editor and publisher of the Nacogdoches
Daily Sentinel.) EMBARGOED for Sunday. MOVED

<P>
   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Ricky McGinn was scheduled to
die Thursday. In 1995, McGinn, who had a record of sexual assault,
was convicted of murdering and raping his 12-year-old stepdaughter
in 1993. The evidence against McGinn was strong: blood on his car
that could have come from less than 1 percent of people other than
the victim, and hair that matched the victim's on an ax identified
as the murder weapon. McGinn's attorneys and death-penalty
opponents were pressing last-minute appeals to try to save him,
including pleas for new DNA tests they say could free him.

pickup they converted into a camper. ``It was magical for me,''

   BOOKS-MITCHELL _ ATLANTA _ It was almost like discovering the
secret diary of Scarlett O'Hara. Seven years ago, Jane Eskridge was
helping her friend Wailes Thomas clean out his mother's 60-year-old
house in Atlanta when she came across a crushed, cobweb-covered
box. Inside, Eskridge found two 1910 letters from Mitchell to her
father from Summit, N.J.; four handmade books written between 1912
and 1913; one untitled shipwreck story; one untitled Civil War
story and the beginning chapters of another; two copybooks with a
poem and seven stories, a play, an essay, and eight journal entries
written between 1915 and 1916. Since most of Mitchell's papers were
destroyed after her death, how these writings survived is a
mystery. Now they're the subject of an exhibit at the Margaret
Mitchell House &AMP; Museum that opens this week and of a new book.

   EMBALAM, India _ In this village at the southern tip of India,
the century-old temple has two doors.
</P>
<P>
   Through one lies tradition. People from the lowest castes and
menstruating women cannot pass its threshold. Inside, the devout
perform daily pujas, offering prayers. Through the second door lies
the Information Age, and anyone may enter.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare social experiment, the village elders have allowed one
side of the temple to house two solar-powered computers that give
this poor village a wealth of data, from the price of rice to the
day's most auspicious hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can get a job through this, I'll be happy,'' said V.
Aruna, 14, who pestered her father, a farmer, until he agreed that
she could come here each day to peck at a computer keyboard, where
she learned Word and PowerPoint. ``I want to work instead of
sitting in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time of growing unease about the global gap between
technology knows and know-nots, India is fast becoming a laboratory
for small experiments like the one at the temple that aim to link
isolated rural pockets to the borderless world of knowledge. Local
governments and nonprofit groups are testing new approaches to
provide villages where barely anyone can afford a telephone with
computer centers that are accessible to all.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, these experiments are still small and there are many
obstacles. The vast majority of Web sites are in English, a
language that more than 95 percent of Indians do not speak. Routine
power failures and overloaded telephone lines make connecting to
the Internet a frustrating proposition.
</P>
<P>
   And there are serious questions about whether countries like
India, weighed down by high rates of illiteracy and illness, should
spend heavily to provide villages that desperately need schools and
health clinics with what most would consider a luxury.
</P>
<P>
   But others say a well-placed computer, like a communal well or
an irrigation pump, may become another tool for development.
</P>
<P>
   Information from the computers in this area, where people live
in thatched mud huts, has saved the life of a milk cow named
Jayalakshmi, prevented blindness in an old woman named M. Minakshi
and routinely warned fishermen of stormy weather that could claim
lives.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet cafes have sprung up quickly even in small Indian
cities, it is in rural areas, where most people live, that
computers must spread if developing nations like India are to close
the yawning technology gap with rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   North America, with less than 5 percent of the world's
population, has more than half of its Internet users. South Asia _
home to more than a fifth of humanity _ has less than 1 percent,
according to the 1999 Human Development Report sponsored by the
U.N. Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem of making computers available to villagers has
led to divergent approaches. Two of the most intriguing efforts are
in the former French colony of Pondicherry and in the central state
of Madhya Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
   The Pondicherry project was created by the Madras-based M.S.
Swaminathan Research Foundation, a nonprofit organization that uses
science and technology to tackle poverty, with a $120,000 grant
from the Canadian government. The foundation provides villages with
free technology and information in exchange for the villages'
promise to house the computers and staff their operation.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of this approach to more of India's 600,000 villages
would ultimately require government money and manpower, with
support from nongovernmental organizations and philanthropies.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Madhya Pradesh approach is more entrepreneurial
and market-driven. Villages have bought computers with money from
their own budgets, and then franchised their operation to a local
person who charges 10 to 35 cents for government records and other
services available at the click of a mouse. The operators, who
receive no regular salary, keep most of the money but give a
portion back to the village and state governments.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the cow and the computer shows that sometimes the
simplest information is the most valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Some months back, Subrayan Panjaili, a round-faced woman who
cannot read or write, sat in the courtyard of her small home in the
village of Kizhur, in Pondicherry, with the family's only milk cow,
Jayalakshmi. For five days and nights, the cow moaned while in
labor. Something had gone wrong and she was unable to deliver her
calf. Panjaili grew ever more fearful that the cow would die.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only good income we have,'' she said, explaining
that the four gallons of milk the cow produced each day paid the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Panjaili's woebegone cow soon spread to Govindaswami, a
public-spirited farmer who uses only one name. The village's
computer, obtained through the Swaminathan Foundation, is in the
anteroom of his home. The computer is operated full time and for no
pay by his 23-year-old, college-educated daughter, Azhalarasi, who
used it to call a list of veterinarians in the area.
</P>
<P>
   One doctor arrived that night and, by the light of a bare
electric bulb, stuck his arm into Jayalakshmi, pulled out one of
the calf's spindly legs, tied a rope to it and dragged the calf out
into the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Swaminathan Foundation has sought to give the four villages
in its network other practical, local information, which is
distributed through the village computer network in the local
language, Tamil. Generally that kind of information is not on the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The network distributes the dates that roving medical camps will
be set up in various villages. M. Minakshi, 70, who said she felt
as if a sari had been draped over her right eye, went to one and
discovered that she needed cataract surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, the project's staff also download a map from a U.S.
Navy Web site that shows the wave heights and wind directions in
the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon in the fishing village of Veerampattinam,
loudspeakers fastened to poles along the beach blared out that
daily weather report. Bare-chested fishermen in loincloths who were
mending nets, repairing homemade wooden boats or just snoozing in
the sultry heat perked up to listen.
</P>
<P>
   The four villages taking part in the project are linked to the
foundation's hub through an ingenious wireless system. It was
dreamed up by V. Balaji, a graduate of the Indian Institute of
Technology at Kanpur, who oversees the project for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   While the foundation's model is relatively costly and may prove
difficult to replicate on a large scale, the government of
Pondicherry plans to expand the project to 50 more villages.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One immediate obstacle, as Balaji notes, is that local
bureaucrats have often been reluctant to give up their monopoly on
information, which can be a source of power used to extract bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping the bureaucrats will become public servants,''
said M.S. Swaminathan, the internationally known geneticist who
leads the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   One such public-spirited civil servant is Amit Agarwal, the
creator of the model computer project in the state of Madhya
Pradesh. It is Agarwal who has taken power out of the hands of
bureaucrats and given it to village entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Agarwal, 29, the chief executive of the Dhar district council,
said he believed that while low-level bureaucrats might be tempted
to demand bribes, an entrepreneur being paid to provide the records
retrieved on a computer would be more inclined to work hard.
</P>
<P>
   He has set up a model project in his district, one of India's
poorest, where young men have a franchise from the state to
distribute daily crop prices and commonly needed state records for
a small fee.
</P>
<P>
   Agarwal predicts that revenue-generating computer projects like
his will spread more quickly than those that depend on scarce state
funds. ``This is the paternalistic welfare model that the country
has been slowly discarding over the past decade as not having
worked,'' Agarwal said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the project was set up in January, 22 villages have each
bought a computer, a modem, a printer and a battery for $1,500 with
their own money and agreed to provide a small booth to house the
setup.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the state then picked a young person from the
village with at least a 10th-grade education to operate the
computer and gave him a franchise to sell information from the
state's computer network.
</P>
<P>
   For 25 to 35 cents, villagers buy printouts of documents that
they might have spent days trying to get from local bureaucrats:
land records, caste certificates and proof of income, among others.
</P>
<P>
   For another 25 cents, any citizen can send a complaint to the
state by e-mail _ ``My pension didn't arrive,'' ``My child's
teacher didn't show up,'' ``My village hand pump doesn't work'' _
and the state guarantees a reply within a week.
</P>
<P>
   And for 10 cents, a farmer can get a printout listing the prices
of any agricultural commodity sold at surrounding markets.
</P>
<P>
   At Bagdi village, wizened, sun-beaten farmers filed in to
collect the day's price lists for wheat, garlic and whatever other
crops they had to sell. They all said their knowledge of the rates
improved their negotiating leverage with middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the price he offers suits me, I'll sell it to him,'' said
Satya Narayan Khati, who grows wheat on his three acres.
``Otherwise, I'll take it to market myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bagdi, the computer booth is operated by Deepak Patel, 20, a
gaunt, lanky son of a farmer. Patel still helps milk the cows and
bring in the harvest, but he prefers his computers. After just a
few months, he is already making a good living from the long hours
he spends selling printouts.
</P>
<P>
   When people come in to e-mail a complaint to the state, Patel
writes out their grievances for them, since most residents of the
district are illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   In his booth, as in every computer center visited in Madhya
Pradesh and Pondicherry, children crowd in, clamoring for a chance
to play on this machine that their elders call a magic box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than farming,'' Patel said. ``Through this you
feel connected to the rest of the world.''

   BOOKS-MITCHELL _ ATLANTA _ It was almost like discovering the
secret diary of Scarlett O'Hara. Seven years ago, Jane Eskridge was
helping her friend Wailes Thomas clean out his mother's 60-year-old
house in Atlanta when she came across a crushed, cobweb-covered
box. Inside, Eskridge found two 1910 letters from Mitchell to her
father from Summit, N.J.; four handmade books written between 1912
and 1913; one untitled shipwreck story; one untitled Civil War
story and the beginning chapters of another; two copybooks with a
poem and seven stories, a play, an essay, and eight journal entries
written between 1915 and 1916. Since most of Mitchell's papers were
destroyed after her death, how these writings survived is a
mystery. Now they're the subject of an exhibit at the Margaret
Mitchell House &AMP; Museum that opens this week and of a new book.

<P>
   ``Let Freedom Ring!'' _ launched during Patriot's Day weekend in
April _ is Boston's three-season celebration of the 225th
anniversary of the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The citywide fest organized by the Freedom Trail Foundation
features more than a hundred free and low-cost activities,
including costumed tours and lectures along the 2.5-mile Freedom
Trail, concerts, exhibits and storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the programs take place in and around the 16 sites on
the trail. The ``Let Freedom Ring'' umbrella also covers Boston
2000 Millennium Celebration July 3-4 and Sail Boston 2000, a visit
by 80 tall ships from 30 countries, July 10-21.
</P>
<P>
   For a free ``Let Freedom Ring! 2000'' brochure, call
1-888-733-2678 or check www.BostonUSA.com. To contact the Freedom
Trail Foundation, call 617-227-8800; www.thefreedomtrail.org.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the highlights:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Independence Day Constitutional: A walk along the Freedom
Trail led by costumed historic interpreters featuring short
Colonial music performances by penny whistle and violin along the
way. Tour begins at Boston Common Visitor Center. 2:30-4:30 p.m.
June 30, July 1, 2, 3 and 4. $10; $5 under 12. 617-227-8800;
www.thefreedomtrail.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Paul Revere's Boston'': On Saturday afternoons through
October, the museum hosts special events that illuminate life in
early Boston. Visitors may watch a silversmith, potter or tailor
plying their trades; attend a concert of Colonial tavern music; and
hear dramatic tales about life in revolutionary Boston. Free with
admission: $2.50; $2 students and seniors; $1 ages 5-17 it to the
Bunker Hill Monument, which commemorates the first formal battle of
the American Revolution on June 17, 1775. We hop a water shuttle to
Long Wharf and make a mad dash for the T _ the subway _ for a ride
to our Back Bay hotel.
</P>
<P>
   And as the thunder rumbles, we can't help but be happy that our
jovial Colonial friend James Otis avoided being caught out in the
thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   History records Otis died in 1783 _ after being struck by a bolt
of lightning.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   After her 9-year-old daughter developed severe acne and an older
daughter also had intractable skin problems, Seema Cicerone began
to wonder whether her kids had inherited their conditions. She told
Dr. Larry Basso, her longtime physician and an internist at the
Palo Alto Medical Foundation, and he dialed up a Web site for
physicians created at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Basso quickly found information on the girls' disease _
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a hormonal imbalance _ and printed
out 20 pages of descriptions, recent research and treatment
descriptions for Cicerone and her husband. They consulted pediatric
specialists and eventually found a low-dose drug regimen that
solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely wonderful to have all the stuff there at
your fingertips,'' Cicerone said. ``We could go to see the
endocrinologist from a point of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, which Stanford first made available to outside
doctors earlier this month, is the latest entry in a race to
transform visits to the doctor by providing a wealth of online
clinical information for physicians. Several other top medical
schools are preparing sites of their own, and there are several
commercially operated sites in operation as well.
</P>
<P>
   These Web sites reinforce a doctor's knowledge, suggest
diagnoses, and provide on-the-spot answers to patients' questions
about their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new Web sites may dramatically improve medical
care for patients who live far from leading medical centers. A
doctor in rural Idaho using one of the new Web sites can learn
about the latest treatments for any disease just as quickly as a
doctor on staff at Stanford or Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the new Web sites and all the other medical
information becoming available online have the potential to alter
the relationship between patient and doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of information about my patients
in the computer,'' said Dr. Thomas H. Lee, an internist and
cardiologist who is medical director for 1,000 doctors at the
Partners Community Health Care network in Boston. ``It's almost
inevitable that as they ask me questions, my eyes glance over to
the screen and I press a couple of keystrokes to get more insight
into the answer. Sometimes my eyes don't glance back so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee added: ``I do think that something can be lost both in terms
of learning what's going on with the patient and in communicating
to patients.''
</P>
<P>
   But help from the computer to prescribe the right dosage of the
right medication is also of ``huge value,'' he said. ``The best
doctors are going to figure out how to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Whitley, a second-grade teacher in Springfield, Mo., asked
her doctor last winter about Relenza, an inhaler for flu symptoms
advertised on television. ``He had never prescribed it before,''
she said. ``He sat right there at the computer and worked it up on
this internet line,'' MDConsult. She got a prescription and a
printout that she said ``was very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts on Internet health care developments say the ultimate
goal, which is probably at least several years away, is to meld
online patient records with information from textbooks and journals
and guidelines suggesting treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term big bang in health care will come when the data
about the patient and the knowledge are completely interwoven,''
said Dr. Bill Detmer, who was a pioneer in making Medline, a huge
government database, available on the Internet in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can subscribe to e-Skolar, the Stanford service, for
$240 a year, the cost of one or two print subscriptions to medical
journals. E-Skolar is exploring the sale of sponsorships to drug
companies, which may give subscriptions to the doctors that the
manufacturers are already courting. Drug makers spent $11.5 billion
last year on marketing to doctors, estimates McKinsey &AMP; Co., a
consulting firm. Two services operated by medical publishers,
MDConsult and Ovid, also charge fees.
</P>
<P>
   Among the commercially operated sites, Medicalogic/Medscape,
which is supported by advertising, is free. HealtheonWebMD has
lined up sponsors, including DuPont and Microsoft, to pay for
subcriptions for physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, these sites sometimes emphasize information
on conditions that can be treated with the sponsors' drugs. Glaxo
Wellcome, for example, sponsors a portion of the WebMD site devoted
to irritable bowel syndrome, which raises awareness of a problem
that may be treated with a Glaxo Wellcome drug.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, primary care doctors say they appreciate the
ability to get information online faster than they can by calling a
colleague or opening a textbook that may be outdated. The latest
medical Web sites, like Stanford's, are designed to find answers
rapidly for doctors who may have little computer expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I might spend a couple of hours trying to find
answers,'' Basso said. ``Now, in two minutes I could have the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman, a specialist in pulmonary problems, said, ``When you
encounter a really weird illness, you can just flame the stuff up
on your net.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ted Shortliffe, who recently left Stanford to become
chairman of the Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia
University, said, ``A good caring physician will often tell a
patient, `I have to look this up, talk to someone','' and respond
in a subsequent appointment or refer the patient to another
physician.
</P>
<P>
   But if the answer is available when the question is asked, he
said, ``health care pays for one less visit, maybe unnecessary
referrals to specialists don't have to occur, and the physician is
more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, managed care companies, which, on average, allot
doctors in their networks eight and a half minutes for each patient
visit, welcome any service that can help doctors shorten office
visits even more to make time for other patients.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are also interested in innovations that promote
``evidence-based medicine'' _ procedures validated by rigorous
clinical trials or by results from long usage _ as a route to cost
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good medicine is less expensive,'' said James Hudak, an
information technology executive at UnitedHealth Group, a managed
care company. ``We will support both consumers and physicians
getting access to evidence-based medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Several big managed care companies, including United Healthcare
and Humana, are planning to join the race to provide online medical
information for doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Big medical groups and many managed care companies, including
United, already try to persuade doctors to pay attention to costs
by telling them how their choices of drugs and diagnostic tests and
referrals to specialists compare with regional averages and other
doctors in the same health plan. If these companies get involved
with the new Web sites, they would have another avenue to
communicate with physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's Web site can answer a question raised by a patient 87
percent of the time, according to Dr. Kenneth Melmon, chief medical
officer of e-Skolar. He said speedy response was essential because
doctors are desperate to become more efficient, partly due to
pressures from managed care. Doctors demand responses from these
online services within seconds, or they walk away, according to a
survey conducted by McKinsey &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors are looking to increase their efficiency and the
quality of care,'' said Steven P. Halper, a health care analyst at
Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``It is a huge and underserved market.
Over time, we think it will evolve into several leading
companies,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on Friday, Harcourt General, the training and publishing
company, said that it would become sole owner of MDConsult by
acquiring the rest of the online service from Wolters Kluwer, a
Dutch company that also owns Ovid and such medical publishers as
Lippincott Williams &AMP; Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   Technology officials at a number of medical centers have reacted
positively to the Stanford announcement. Johns Hopkins said it will
soon introduce its own information Web sites for physicians. And
Harvard's teaching hospitals are testing e-Skolar, which includes
access to DXplain, an aid to diagnosing a disease that was
developed at Massachusetts General Hospital, alongside the
hospitals' system of electronic patient records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited'' about the possibilities, said Dr. Robert
C. Goldszer, chairman of the computer advisory group at Brigham &AMP;
Women's Hospital in Boston, which has put information about drug
orders and lab results on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really good idea, a real plus,'' said Dr. Brent C.
James, a vice president of Intermountain Health Care, a
technologically advanced medical system in Salt Lake City. ``The
technical problem would be to integrate it with what we already
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the online medical information services will
hinge on how often doctors use them, said Jon Duane, the chief West
Coast health-care consultant for McKinsey. To keep doctors clicking
in, Medscape e-mails weekly newsletters telling specialists about
the latest developments in their fields.
</P>
<P>
   MDConsult even provides a synopsis of the latest episode of the
popular television show ``ER,'' to prepare physicians for questions
from viewers among their patients.

GATEWAY AND AOL BYPASS STALWARTS ON COMPONENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Breaking ranks with the powerful ``Wintel
duopoly,'' based on Intel hardware and Microsoft software, Gateway
and America Online plan to use a processor from an upstart Silicon
Valley chip maker and a version of the Linux operating system in a
new Internet home appliance scheduled to go on sale later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is a big victory for Transmeta Corp., a chip design
company in Santa Clara that has developed a microprocessor intended
to be a low-power and inexpensive alternative to Intel's
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta was founded five years ago by David Ditzel, the former
Sun Microsystems hardware designer, with backing from George Soros,
the financier; Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder; Deutsche Bank;
and others. It said last month that it had raised an additional $88
million in financing from Compaq Computer, Gateway, Samsung, Sony
and a number of Taiwanese manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a portent of the arrival of what is being popularly
referred to as the post-PC computing era, a world in which the
personal computer is displaced by an expanding array of digital
cellular phones, personal digital assistants, Webpads _ which are
tablet-style computers _ and other appliancelike devices.
</P>
<P>
   Both Intel and Microsoft have largely resisted this vision,
maintaining instead that the PC will remain at the center of the
computing world for many years and that the new devices will
function more or less as peripherals to a central PC.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway executives on Friday said they had decided to break with
Intel and Microsoft because the new devices were not personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not building a personal computer, we're building an
appliance,'' said Peter Ashkin, Gateway's senior vice president and
chief technology officer. ``Hence, there was no strong requirement
for Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashkin said the choice of the Transmeta chip was appropriate to
the new devices, which are intended to be placed on a kitchen
counter or a desk and eventually to be carried around the home as
wireless Webpads always connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ashkin said Transmeta turned out to be an excellent choice.
``Their chip offered a unique combination of low power and low
cost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many executives in the computer industry believe that the next
generation of computing will bring fresh opportunities for
competitors like Transmeta to offer alternatives to the dominant
industry powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Microsoft off the desktop, and Intel out from inside
the desktop,'' said Robert Enderle, a market researcher who is vice
president for desktop and mobile technologies at Giga Information
Group.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to the Wintel monopoly is a replay of an earlier
skirmish that became one of the central points of contention in the
Microsoft antitrust trial last year.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, a Gateway executive, James Von Holle, served
as a witness for the Justice Department and described how Microsoft
had put pressure on Gateway after it pursued a strategy of
installing the Netscape browser and placing an AOL icon on the
desktop of its computers.
</P>
<P>
   Now both America Online and Gateway have potentially found a way
to displace Microsoft's software entirely by using a special
version of the free Linux operating system that will run the
Netscape browser customized for each company's online service.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are definitely willing to take more risks today,''
Ditzel said. ``The truth is that the phrase `Internet appliance'
has become a code word in the industry meaning `no Windows.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to the Internet appliance market, Transmeta is
trying to push into the market for portable computers. The first
portables based on the Transmeta chips are likely to be announced
next month at the PC Expo computer trade show in New York, Ditzel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta gained significant visibility in January when after
five years as a secret design laboratory, it announced two new
chips that were compatible with Intel's X86 design, which includes
the Pentium chips, yet consumed only about one watt of power _ much
more efficient than Intel's.
</P>
<P>
   The company's microprocessors use a novel Very Long Instruction
Word, or VLIW, processing approach that is an attempt to simplify
computing hardware by shifting many functions to software.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has since shown a technology demonstration of one of its
chips consuming only about a watt of power. Many analysts, however,
doubt that the chip-making giant can push aggressively into the
low-power market without harming its other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Transmeta garnered a great deal of attention when it
hired Linus Torvalds, a Finnish programmer who created and led the
open-source effort to develop the Linux operating system as a free
alternative to Microsoft's and other operating-system programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ditzel said on Friday that Torvalds had led an effort to modify
Linux to run without a hard disk to make it usable by inexpensive
consumer appliances. Gateway executives said on Friday that the
first ``tethered'' version of the new Internet appliance would go
on sale during the fourth quarter and that wireless versions would
be available in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway will sell the machines through its network of 260 retail
stores, while America Online will market them directly to its
subscribers. Neither company is certain about the final price of
the product, which is aimed at below $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a place up on my wall where people come in and
scribble numbers between $99 and $499,'' Ashkin said.

 &HT;    Pilgrimage to Plymouth makes vacation history

<TEXT>
<P>
   PLYMOUTH, Mass. _ As rocks go, it doesn't look like anything
special. It's not nearly as big as Gibraltar. It doesn't glisten
like gold or seal a sepulcher.
</P>
<P>
   But this smooth gray stone must be a big deal, enshrined as it
is under a portico that looks like a classical temple. Then there's
the telltale date carved on it: 1620.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just aams here in 1620; Plimoth Plantation, a
living-history village that interprets the daily lives of the
colonists in 1627; and Pilgrim Hall Museum, where you can see what
they brought to America and learn about their perilous journey.
</P>
<P>
   The town itself is quite charming, not nearly as touristy as I
had expected, and everything is within easy walking distance. There
are a number of museums and historic homes open for tours,

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``28 Days'' PG-13 (profanity, substance
</P>
<P>
   abuse and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Viggo Mortensen.
</P>
<P>
   The cinema's chipper girl next door (Sandra Bullock) goes clean
and sober in an addiction and rehab movie that, thankfully, isn't
an appalling clinical ``comedy'' like ``Patch Adams.'' It's a
professional, appealing comedy-drama, but in trying to be all
things to all viewers (to beer-loving Bullock fans as well as
devoted 12-steppers), it never really comes into focus. (SM)1 hour,
43 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the Sea of Time'' G
</P>
<P>
   3-D Imax film
</P>
<P>
   about New York City.
</P>
<P>
   History comes alive visually in this 3-D Imax movie focusing on
New York City. It's full of big, gloriously detailed ``stereoview''
photographs depicting immigrant life at the turn of the century.
(Bob Longino)51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Battlefield Earth'' PG-13 (intense sci-fi action)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   Teens likely will be unable to stay awake, let alone make any
sense out of ``Battlefield Earth,'' a flat-footed sci-fi epic.
Boring, murky and full of unintentionally funny lines, this pet
project of star John Travolta is based on the 1982 novel by L. Ron
Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology, to which Travolta
belongs. (Jane Horwitz, Washington Post)1 hour, 57 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Beefcake'' Unrated (simulated sex
</P>
<P>
   and lots of nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Daniel MacIvor
</P>
<P>
   and Josh Peace.
</P>
<P>
   A cheerful, campy but empty-headed look at homoeroticism.
Writer-director Thom Fitzgerald (``The Hanging Garden'') takes us
to the world of Hollywood in the1950s. It's a place where handsome,
wide-eyed wannabes could find themselves ushered into a poolside
wonderland of well-muscled men wearing nothing but teeny-tiny
posing pouches. (SM)1 hour, 36 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Kahuna'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey,
</P>
<P>
   Danny DeVito and Bob Facinelli.
</P>
<P>
   This three-hander is well worth your time for the terrific
acting. Three salesmen _ a corrosive cynic, (Kevin Spacey), a
resigned old-timer (Danny DeVito) and an eager-beaver newcomer (Bob
Facinelli) _ wait in their version of hell, i.e., a hospitality
suite in Wichita, for the chance to land that one all-important
client. Spacey and DeVito's performances are bracing and brainy.
(ERG)1 hour, 31 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Momma's House'' PG-13 (crude humor, sexual,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence
</P>
<P>
   and Nia Long.
</P>
<P>
   It's one super-sized Martin Lawrence. As an FBI agent on a
neighborhood stakeout to capture a vicious bank robber, Lawrence
dons layer upon layer of prosthetics to impersonate a 325-pound,
small-town granny in Cartersville (the movie, however, was filmed
in Los Angeles). The results may be predictable, but with
Lawrence's manic comedic timing they are also occasionally quite
funny. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 39 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Center Stage'' PG-13 (sexuality and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Stiefel,
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Schull and Zoe Saldana.
</P>
<P>
   An old-fashioned show biz fantasy for teenagers with leotards
and plies, ``Center Stage'' is a kind of movie that gets retooled
every 10 years or so. Its antecedents include ``Fame,'' ``Dirty
Dancing,'' ``The Turning Point'' and even ``Flashdance.'' It's the
female version of a sports movie: Sweat and inspiration lead to
love and brief heartache, but ultimately growth, self-worth and
even stardom result. (SM)1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (sexuality, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   John Irving has adapted his own novel. In the first half of the
film, Dr. Larch (Michael Caine) delivers babies and performs
illegal abortions in his Maine orphanage. In the second,
less-engaging half, Larch's protege, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire),
runs off to learn about the world. An uneven but heartfelt and film
with excellent performances. (ERG)2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' PG (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   D.B. Sweeney, Della Reese
</P>
<P>
   and Julianna Margulies.
</P>
<P>
   Leapin' lizards! The prehistoric critters in Disney's
years-in-the-making, $200 million-plus computer animation do more
than leap. Alas, the plot is worth about two cents _ something
about an Iguanodon raised by lemurs who helps a herd of dinosaurs
find a fabled nesting ground after a disastrous meteor shower.
Parents be aware: While most of the movie is Barney-tame, the scary
parts are quite scary. (ERG)1 hour, 24 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``East Is East'' R (profanity
</P>
<P>
   and domestic violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Om Puri
</P>
<P>
   and Linda Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   Set in working-class Britain in 1971, this uneven but energetic
film focuses on a boisterous Anglo-Pakistani family. The father is
a tyrannical type, while the mother is a grounded fish-and-chips
Englishwoman. And the kids are totally caught up in the exploding
England Swings pop-culture surrounding them. The very good cast,
headed by Om Puri and Linda Bassett, is a huge asset. (ERG)1 hour,
36 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Filth and the Fury'' R (profanity, violence,
</P>
<P>
   sexual and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Documentarian Julien Temple uses an artful mixture of
interviews, concert footage and archival clips to capture the life
of the controversial band the Sex Pistols. Temple's movie reminds
us what a short, strange trip it's been, taking us through a
spit-smeared looking glass to a time so close and yet so very far
away. (ERG) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' R (bloody violence and raw language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Devon Sawa,
</P>
<P>
   Ali Larter and Kerr Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' aims for young audiences with an
``X-Files/The Wonder Years'' science/suspense plot about a kid who
escaped death from a plane crash and learns more than mortals
should about death. Our hero (Devon Sawa) and six others find
they're still targeted for death. The Grim Reaper, feeling cheated,
has plans for them. (Chris Hewitt, Knight Ridder Newspapers)1 hour,
33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Flintstones
</P>
<P>
   in Viva Rock Vegas'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mark Addy
</P>
<P>
   and Stephen Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Yabba-dabba-don't. A new, needless, live-action ``Flintstones,''
with Mark Addy as Fred, Stephen Baldwin as Barney, and the
courtship of Wilma and Betty as the plot. Inoffensive and mildly
amusing in spots, but hardly worth a trip to the theater. (Stephen
Whitty, Newhouse News Service)1 hour, 29 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequency'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dennis Quaid
</P>
<P>
   and Jim Caviezel.
</P>
<P>
   John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) hears dead people. Specifically, he
hooks up to his dad's old ham radio set in 1999 and finds himself
talking to his dad (Dennis Quaid) in 1969. More crucially, John
knows his dad, a fireman, will be killed in a failed heroic rescue
the next day. Although over-plotted, the sentimental film has that
``what if?'' fascination. It's also a mind-bender and especially
savvy about emotional button-pushing. (ERG) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG) 2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Held Up'' PG-13 (profanity, violence, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jamie Foxx
</P>
<P>
   and Nia Long.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Foxx is likable and funny as a Chicago businessman trapped
in a rural gas station who gets caught in the crossfire of would-be
bandits and the local sheriff and his posse of redneck deputies.
It's an amiable cross-cultural comedy bogged down midway through
the film by a big lull and a few static moments. (Kevin Thomas, Los
Angeles Times)1 hour, 31 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>

&HT;     THE LASTING ART OF DONG KINGMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Because he was 89 years old and had not lived in
the Bay Area for at least a couple of generations, Dong Kingman
died last month with minimal notice in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As befits an artist, however, his work _ spirited, evocative,
happy watercolors _ ensures that the essence of the man will
command attention for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oakland five years after the great earthquake and fire
of 1906, Kingman was a marvelous mix of Asia and America. His
parents were Chinese immigrants who settled in the Bay Area but
moved back to Hong Kong to educate their children.
</P>
<P>
   Until he returned as an adult to the United States during the
Depression, Kingman studied Asian and European painting in China,
as well as calligraphy and architectural drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Each discipline is evident in his many works _ mostly vignettes
of city streets, parks, skylines and water vistas. Also apparent in
his paintings and sketches is nothing less than his outlook on
life.
</P>
<P>
   As the late San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen once
wrote, ``The wonderful world of Kingman . . . a happy world of
bright scenes and hopeful people.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an attitude, said Caen, was Kingman ``only being true to
himself, for Dong is one of the happiest people I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends since Kingman's first one-man show in 1933, Caen and the
artist joined forces in 1967 to produce a beautiful book called
``City on Golden Hills'' (Doubleday). It contains some of the
newspaperman's finest, most poignant love letters to San Francisco
and print after print of Kingman's visual valentines to a city he
never stopped admiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is entirely appropriate that Dong Kingman should be my
collaborator on this book,'' wrote Caen, ``for San Francisco _ the
city of his heart and mine _ has been spiced and enriched by the
strong flavor of China ever since it came of age as a world
metropolis.''
</P>
<P>
   As was often Kingman's custom, many of the illustrations in
``City on Golden Hills'' are peeks and glimpses of well-known San
Francisco landmarks from almost secret or insider perspectives:
</P>
<P>
   _ The tip of a tower of the Bay Bridge, tucked behind the heavy
black lattice ironwork of the Third Street truncheon drawbridge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Old St. Mary's Church through the tree branches that line
narrow little Quincy Street off California Street.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coit Tower, tiny and toy-like, from beneath the massive
concrete decks of the (now-demolished) Embarcadero Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   As Caen wrote of Kingman in his afterword to their book:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 30 years that we have been friends, I have never seen
him without his large notebook and India ink pen . . . he is
constantly sketching, sketching, sketching _ in lightning shorthand
strokes that capture a landscape, a line, a likeness in a flash, a
hidden corner that is suddenly illuminated and captured by the
eternal freshness of his vision.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York Times, Kingman's original ambition was
to be a film director. The closest he came was in the early 1960s
when he painted scenes for three Asian-themed American films, ``55
Days at Peking,'' ``The World of Suzie Wong'' and _ perhaps his
loveliest _ ``Flower Drum Song,'' which was set in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a Guggenheim Award winner, Kingman taught art at Columbia
University and Hunter College, among other schools. He traveled the
world, painting its cities and its people.
</P>
<P>
   His works are included in the collections of every major New
York museum as well as the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and
the de Young Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kingman lived most of his adult years in Manhattan, he
never disconnected from the city of his youth, the city on the
eastern edge of the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   As Caen told it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Shortly after he moved to New York, I visited him at his
studio, where I found him by a window, painting a row of trees.
Looking out the window and seeing only rooftops, I asked, `Where do
you see those trees?'
</P>
<P>
   ```In Portsmouth Square in San Francisco,' he said, grinning.''

&HT;     DECISION ON 49ERS QB EXPECTED IN WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ San Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci
expects the team's injured quarterback to make a decision on his
playing future by June 10, a decision that would end months of
speculation since a concussion sidelined Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci and Young spoke Tuesday night and the quarterback asked
for a little more time to make his momentous decision. A decision
had been expected this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be out of town and will be back next week,''
Mariucci said Wednesday as the 49ers held a minicamp for rookies
and selected veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would like to get it over with. We all would,'' Mariucci
said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 249 days since he suffered the concussion that
knocked him out of the final 13 games of the 1999 season and put
his career in peril.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mariucci, the issue with Young now is not medical
or financial. It's strictly football: Does he want to play again?
Young has passed a battery of neurological tests and has
essentially been cleared to play again if he so desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has taken various tests and clinically, he's normal,''
Mariucci said. ``If we can consider Steve Young normal, he's
normal. He passed all the tests with flying colors.''
</P>
<P>
   When the coach spoke to his 38-year-old quarterback before he
left on a trip, the two discussed Eric Lindros, the Philadelphia
Flyers' hockey star who returned to the game after a lengthy
concussion-induced layoff only to pick up another concussion on a
jarring hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he feels for Eric. We all wish him well,'' Mariucci
said. ``Every situation is independent and different. How that is
related to Steve, no one knows. Steve has to make the decision
based on his own information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know as much as we can know about the risks and Steve's
willingness to continue to play. It's going to be up to Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   With a new wife who is pregnant, Young may not want to risk his
health by continuing to play. And the 49ers seem ready to move on
without him. Jeff Garcia is the starting quarterback until further
notice and rookies Giovanni Carmazzi and Tim Rattay are getting
practice time behind him as talk of signing career washout Rick
Mirer has cooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to revisit that,'' which is Mariucci's way of saying
Mirer will probably not be signed. ``We've been so consumed with
Steve's condition we haven't discussed that. We could make the
decision to go with these three men.''

&HT;     SEAN CONLEY CRUISES THROUGH FINAL ROUNDS OF SPELLING BEE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sean Conley, a slender 12-year-old from Newark,
Calif., confidently cruised through two more rounds of increasingly
tougher words Thursday, the final day of the 73rd National Spelling
Bee. He correctly spelled Mackinaw and ferriferous.
</P>
<P>
   Sean, who is sponsored by the San Francisco Examiner, took
several deep breaths and rocked from side to side before the word
pronouncer issued his first challenge: Mackinaw, which is a short,
belted coat of heavy fabric.
</P>
<P>
   As he did Wednesday when he survived the first three rounds of
the bee, Sean asked that the word be repeated a few times for
alternate pronunciations. Then he asked its origin and its use in a
sentence before acing its spelling. He was among 110 spellers who
remained of the original 248 who competed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the fourth round, the home-schooled seventh grader stepped
down from the stage to stretch his legs during a break and appeared
calm and confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth round is usually pretty hard, but this was
easier,'' he said, adding that he knew the words his competitors
had been asked earlier in the round _ ``all except for a couple.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean said he kept quizzing the pronouncer about Mackinaw ``to
make sure I'm hearing it right and to give me some time to think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The technique worked for him Wednesday when he successfully
knocked off nyctalopia, or the inability to see at twilight;
discomfiture, which means frustration or confusion, and floppety,
which means soft and flexible.
</P>
<P>
   After the fourth round, the number of spellers had dwindled to
64, with the losers being ushered to the so-called ``comfort room''
to regain their composure after hearing the tinny bell that signals
a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Sean's mother Bry, who teaches him at home, scurried to the
aisle to remind him to tuck his shirt in, gave him the old theater
morale-booster, ``break a leg,'' and then added, ``Or, break a
tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth round, Sean tackled ferriferous, which means
containing iron, This time he barely hesitated before nailing that
word too.
</P>
<P>
   Sean's father Mike was sitting in the back row at the crowded
auditorium of the Grand Hyatt Hotel here where the bee was held. He
said he was ``just trying to remain calm.''
</P>
<P>
   The final day is more of a nail-biter, he said, because his son
actually has a chance to better his ninth-place tie in the national
bee last year.
</P>
<P>
   The bee is sponsored by E.W. Scripps Co.

&HT;     BOURBON MAKERS GO STRICTLY BY THE BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN GRIFFIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Rules, rules, rules: They are everywhere, even
in the distillery. It may come as a surprise just how strict the
rules governing bourbon are. They date to the 19th century and are
fairly inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   Bourbon must be made from at least 51 percent corn, though most
distillers use more than 65 percent. It cannot be more than 160
proof. It must be aged for at least two years in a new, white oak
barrel that has been charred. (Note the word ``new.'' No barrel can
be used twice.) Nothing can be added at bottling to enhance flavor
or add sweetness or color.
</P>
<P>
   Bourbon, by classification, also must be made in the United
States, in the same way scotch must be distilled in Scotland or
Irish Whisky in Ireland. Almost all bourbons are distilled in
Kentucky (which is where the white oak grows), with Virginia
Gentleman being among the very few exceptions. (Jack Daniel's, a
Tennessee whiskey, is charcoal filtered and, therefore, doesn't
qualify.)
</P>
<P>
   A few of the myths and mandates that go into making Kentucky's
favorite spirit were offered to a rapt crowd of cigar smokers
during the recent Texas Hill Country Wine and Food Festival by
David Pickerell, vice president of production at the venerated
Maker's Mark Distillery.
</P>
<P>
   Over sips of the liquor at various stages of the aging process,
Pickerell told one of the more popular legends surrounding the
birth of bourbon. Some have traced its origins to a Southern
Baptist minister named the Rev. Elijah Craig, who charred out a
white oak barrel as a means of ridding it of a fish odor. True or
not, the irony involved in the story has kept it in circulation for
many years.
</P>
<P>
   Few dispute the origin of the name, which came from Bourbon
County, Ky., where most of the distillation occurred. That can be
traced back further to the Bourbon dynasty in France. (Francophiles
were in abundance in Kentucky's pioneer days, as can be seen in the
names of the cities Louisville and Versailles.)
</P>
<P>
   By 1810, there were 2,000 registered distillers, Pickerell said.
Of that lot, Maker's Mark is the only one still in production. It
survived Prohibition and is going strong today, despite competition
from other premium bourbons such as Booker's and Knob Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand for Maker's Mark this year is going to be higher
than what we can produce,'' Pickerell said.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe for what is currently distilled, developed by Bill
Samuels, has not been altered since it was introduced in 1958.
Samuels' set of rules insisted on iron-free limestone spring water
as well as red winter wheat instead of rye. The grains are still
crushed with an antique rollermill because it won't scorch the
grain like modern milling machines. To create its velvety taste,
each wooden barrel stave must be air dried outdoors for nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   The early response was a bit different from what bourbon
drinkers think today, Pickerell said, relating a story of how
displeased another famous Kentucky distiller, Jim Beam, was when he
first tried it.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently told Samuels, ``Who wants a sissy whiskey
anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   True or not, it's another choice footnote in bourbon's flavorful
story.

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Having access to an electric meat grinder has
really been a big help in allowing me to try different game recipes
that feature ground meat, stew meat and other creations.
</P>
<P>
   While the hand-cranked grinders like the one passed down by my
wife's grandmother can be used, a three-quarter horse power motor
working for you is a real time saver.
</P>
<P>
   I use the grinder for making sausage, both patties and link, in
addition to grinding all the venison I use for hamburgers, chili
and such. The grinder also comes in handy when meats are on sale,
allowing for inexpensive packages of ground beef or pork.
</P>
<P>
   In the following recipe, I like to grind the onion with the meat
to make a fine meatloaf mixture. No fuss, no muss and no tears.
</P>
<P>
   This makes great sandwiches or can be served as a main dish with
heated tomato sauce on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   LEAN, MEAN MEATLOAF
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds venison steaks
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion
</P>
<P>
   2 tbsp bacon grease (optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup catsup
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Kraft Parm Plus
</P>
<P>
   1/2 tsp garlic salt
</P>
<P>
   salt and black pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Grind steaks and onion together in a meat grinder, using the
fine-grind blade. Place meat in a large bowl and add remaining
ingredients (I add the bacon grease for flavor and because the meat
is very lean). Mix well. Shape into a large loaf, place into a
greased pan and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.

SO LONG, `BILLY BUDD`?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below; `tonight' refers to Sat., June 3) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Rodney Gilfry feels downcast whenever he thinks about playing Billy
Budd for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   So do thousands of opera fans from Dallas to Geneva who've seen
the L.A. baritone's virile, magnetic portrayal of the doomed,
heroic young sailor in Benjamin Britten's 1951 work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but I'm not the spring chicken I was,''
Gilfry, 41, responds when asked if this month's performance for the
Los Angeles Opera might be his final ``Billy Budd.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, within a few seconds, Gilfry has talked himself out of
this apparently unthinkable notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a role that I love very much,'' Gilfry says resolutely,
``and I really don't want to give it up. And I don't want to see
any reason that I should.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, why should he? True, Billy Budd, the handsome,
stammering British seaman who runs afoul of the evil master-at-arms
Claggart, is barely into his 20s. As described by Herman Melville
in his 1891 maritime parable, which inspired Britten and his
librettist E.M. Forster, Billy Budd is a true innocent swimming
among sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy has a kind of outer strength but an inner-childness, and
he's naive,'' Gilfry says. ``He knows no evil. He has a pure
spirituality that's practically untainted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Covina-born Gilfry, on the other hand, is a worldly, savvy
professional and married father of three, a middle-aged,
middle-class suburbanite who now makes his home in Rancho Cucamonga
when he's not jetting off to the world's leading opera houses.
</P>
<P>
   But with his blond California good looks, strong acting skills
and an Olympian's physique that gets mentioned every time he's
interviewed, Gilfry is still strong enough of body and voice to
satisfy most any opera buff's vision of budding Billy.
</P>
<P>
   As proved by his hunky portrayal of Stanley Kowalski in last
September's San Francisco Opera world premiere of Andre Previn's
``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' Gilfry has the physical goods to keep
playing Billy Budd. As Los Angeles Opera founding general director
Peter Hemmings points on, Gilfry certainly wouldn't be the first
baritone to sing the role into his mature years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essentially a young man's part, obviously,'' Hemmings
says. ``Rod himself says that he's 41 and the part's a 21-year-old.
But that convention is not unusual in the cinema, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Director Francesca Zambello's production of ``Billy Budd''
arrives in L.A. after premiering in Geneva in 1994. It was later
staged at Britain's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. With an
all-male cast that also features bass Jeffrey Wells as Claggart,
and tenor Robert Tear as the wise but wavering Captain Vere, the
production is a scaled-down replica of the Geneva version.
</P>
<P>
   ``This production is a very physical production in the sense
that there's a lot of guys on stage shirtless, there's a lot of
sweat,'' Gilfry says. ``It's not the buttoned-up military type
production where everyone's in authentic-looking 18th-century
military-looking costumes and there's a decorum of dress that's
followed on the set. It's much more impressionistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilfry will be playing another character with the initials B.B.
this summer. He'll co-star as Billy Bigelow in a semi-staged
production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ``Carousel'' at the
Hollywood Bowl on Au. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Budd'' will mark the close of Hemmings' 16-year helming
of Los Angeles Opera; he's retiring this summer to return with his
wife to the couple's native England.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings had been wanting to bring ``Billy Budd'' to Los Angeles
for at least a half-dozen years, but unforeseen events like the
1994 Northridge earthquake intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Having launched his professional career with L.A. Opera _ he had
a one-line role as a herald opposite Placido Domingo in ``Otello''
_ Gilfry is a longtime hometown favorite. Though he has sung 23
different roles in his career, including the title character in
``Don Giovanni,'' Figaro in ``Il barbiere di Siviglia'' and Belcore
in ``L'elisir d'amore,'' Gilfry was glad for the chance to finally
perform his signature part at the Dorothy Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am home at least half of the year, which has only been made
possible because the Los Angeles Opera is willing to hire me a
couple times a year and leaving me in the very enviable position of
having a thriving international career and still be home,'' he
says. ``As a father, I can tell you it's still too much time
away.''
</P>
<P>
   So, seriously now, how long will he keep playing Billy Budd?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be very arrogant and presumptuous to the extent that ...
I would want someone who was doing the role to audition for me, so
I could say, `You've got the right idea' or, `You haven't got the
right idea.' I'm so happy to do that, because it's my chance to
save the role once again from being mistreated.''

&HT;     A `MILLIONAIRE' WITH AN ADRENALINE RUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With one episode of the massively hyped summer series
``Survivor'' in the can, we can safely assume that those who
watched this reality-voyeur series about 16 castaways on an island
off Borneo will be back again and again.
</P>
<P>
   If CBS got any kind of ratings at all Wednesday night for its
``Lord of the Flies'' meets ``The Real World'' epic, then expect a
kind of mini-``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' to sweep away the
summer programming doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   This is the right kind of game show. You can still win a million
dollars _ the ultimate prize to the last castaway standing _ but
you have to eat rats and fight snakes to do it, not use a lifeline
to guess if the right color for a pumpkin is orange. Have a seat,
Regis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' is an imported idea that feels American, what with
the action, anger and adrenaline. The series runs for 13-episodes
so either somebody dies or more than one gets the boot, or leaves
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of ``Survivor'' is simple: You get to sit on your couch
while a bunch of thrown-together strangers try and get along,
failing miserably and making great TV of it.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are pretty basic. Sixteen people who met for the first
time four hours earlier are put on a boat in the South China Sea,
heading for the tiny jungle island of Pulau Tiga. Well short of the
coast, they are divided into teams of eight and given two minutes
to get as much stuff off the main vessel and onto bamboo rafts as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   One team made it to the island in two hours, the other in three.
After brief hugging and exhausted high-fives, they began getting
snippy with each other. Chemistry is key in a series like this. And
``Survivor'' looks prone to explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The teams are given names that correspond to their beach areas
on the island: The Tagi Tribe and the Pagong Tribe. They will be on
the island for 39 days. They will have to work together, band
together, then work against one another when the voting comes. It
was clear in about two minutes on Wednesday that the Tagi Tribe was
set to re-enact ``Lord of the Flies'' while the Pagong Tribe at
least had a semblance of bonding.
</P>
<P>
   Just like ``Real World,'' viewers may find that opinions about
some castaways change each week, sometimes every few minutes. The
beauty of the show is that Sonja, an elderly woman who was the
first to leave the island, was sweet. You'd much rather have tossed
out Richard, a kind of pouty corporate trainer, or maybe Rudy, the
overzealous 72-year-old former Navy SEAL who still looks like he
can whip your hide.
</P>
<P>
   Each weekly episode encapsulates three days on the island. We
see a lot of foraging, a good bit of lounging around, some
ingenuity (the Pagong Tribe started a fire quickly), a boat load of
jealousy, snappy judgments and, ultimately, the beginning of a
little fear. There are snakes. Spiders. Rats. And not a lot of
food. You can tell that as the weak and the annoying are winnowed
out, it's going to get pretty ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but that's the beauty of a dumb show like this. We don't
want people sitting around camp fires hugging each other. We want
``Gilligan's Island'' on crack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' works brilliantly as drama because the viewer has a
rooting interest in who stays or goes. CBS tosses in games each
episode, pitting the two teams against each other for goods (like
matches, or chocolate) and some coveted immunity (you get to stay
another night on the island).
</P>
<P>
   The setup is kind of hokey, but what do you expect? This is
staged reality. People are interviewed anonymously. The action is
sometimes narrated by the host, Jeff Probst, and some elements are
way over the top (elaborate huts with fire, ominous sayings like
``The tribe has spoken'' and so on).
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how this plays out with Middle
America. ``Survivor'' could be a huge hit. Remember, most people
don't watch MTV and ``The Real World.'' This reality-voyeur stuff
could prove addictive to them (and there's plenty more coming down
the pipe).
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' certainly makes for better work banter than talking
about ``Friends'' or ``Felicity.''

 &HT;    BEIJING'S OLD CITY RESIDENTS HAVING TO MAKE ROOM FOR NEW
DEVELOPMENT
 &HT;    (1000&AMP;ADDS)
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., June 4 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By JULIE CHAO 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Zhao Zhifeng and her extended family had lived in
their modest one-story house all their lives. In fact, they'd owned
it going back 200 years. But in China, although you can own
buildings, you can never own the land.
</P>
<P>
   So one morning in March, about 30 men showed up with two
bulldozers, she recalls with a mixture of anger and distress, and
turned most of her home to rubble. The land rights had been sold to
developers, and her house was in the way of whatever it is they're
planning _ an office or apartment complex, she still doesn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Now living in the remaining half of the house, Zhao and her
family refuse to go.
</P>
<P>
   All across the city center, re-development has leveled
neighborhoods and destroyed the den of alleys and courtyard houses
that typify old Beijing. In their place have appeared gaudy
shopping malls and undistinguished commercial buildings.
</P>
<P>
   An unusually critical commentary in the Beijing Evening News, a
daily newspaper here, decried the new structures as ``architectural
garbage, the ugliest acne on the face of the ancient capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as this city of 14 million tries to remake itself into
a 21st Century metropolis, as bicycles and horse-drawn carts get
squeezed out by the increasingly ubiquitous automobile and
high-rises seem to go up overnight, it's not just regard for
aesthetics that has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   The human cost of ``modernization'' has not come cheap.
Complaints about forced and _ in the case of Zhao _ illegal
demolitions have been soaring as developers race to put up
commercial space and bring in profits.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of letters and lawsuits over the years has culminated
in what may be the largest citizen action in the Communist country
in years: a petition signed by more than 10,000 people was
delivered to the central government in March demanding proper
compensation for being evicted and an investigation into what the
petitioners believe is massive corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the staggering pace of urban renewal is only
accelerating. More than 1 million people, or 220,000 households,
have been displaced since the early 1990s, when Beijing opened up
the real estate market for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.6 square miles of housing was demolished between 1990
and 1998. According to the Beijing Morning Post, this year will
break all records, with another 1 square mile of land to be
re-developed, partly for commercial development, partly for road
expansion to ease the ever-worsening traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The government has made some efforts at preservation. Last year,
it designated 25 historic zones in the city center for protection,
but together they comprise less than two square miles. Many
architects believe that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Some say the architectural splendor of old Beijing started
waning when the Communists came to power in 1949 and declared the
ancient city walls remnants of the feudal society. So they tore
down the walls and old watchtowers to make way for the Second Ring
Road, now a clogged six-lane highway. Beijing natives still recall
the walls fondly as the epitome of the old city.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several decades, as Beijing industrialized,
housing became congested; buildings crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to generate revenue to improve living conditions,
the government opened the real estate market in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in communist China, private developers could
get the rights to a piece of land, then profit after resettling
evicted households and building an office tower, hotel or shopping
center. Many residents were happy to be moved out of their old
houses _ most with no heating or indoor toilets _ and be given some
cash and a modern new apartment to rent in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But architects have become alarmed at the thoughtlessness of the
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``To renovate you need investment. With investment you need
returns. So they build bigger and bigger buildings with more and
more volume,'' Jiang Zhongguang, professor at the Beijing Institute
of Civil Engineering and Architecture, said in an interview with
Cox Newspapers. ``From the standpoint of economic efficiency, this
is what is needed. But from a city preservation standpoint, we
can't continue like this.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 standing committee members of the National People's
Congress _ China's parliament _ presented a letter last year to
central party leaders appealing for an investigation into
violations of relics laws, not only in Beijing but also in other
cities experiencing a similar scale of demolition.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao's house was no architectural treasure. But it had been in
the family for seven generations. With half of it now in a pile of
concrete, she and her family squeezed into the part of the house
still standing and are refusing to go while all her neighbors have
moved away.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote to numerous government agencies appealing for monetary
damages and the right to hold a march to protest what her lawyer
says was an illegal demolition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't even begin to talk about human rights,'' said Zhao,
52. ``They violated our right to live. How can we live without a
house?''
</P>
<P>
   She believes corruption of local authorities was behind her
case. She is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ordinary citizens have written the central
government alleging collusion between land officials and developers
to pocket part of the resettlement fees. Evicted residents have
also filed hundreds of lawsuits in the last five years demanding
due compensation.
</P>
<P>
   With no response to their letters and no court willing to hear a
case, 10,357 people petitioned Beijing's Number Two Intermediate
People's Court in February to investigate possible corruption and
violations of property rights. They sent the petition to the State
Council, China's Cabinet, and other central government agencies in
March after the court did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   One of the signatories was Zhao Jingxin (no relation to Zhao
Zhifeng). But he is no ordinary Beijing resident.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, the 82-year-old retired professor has resisted
eviction notices, insisting that his beautifully preserved,
17th-Century courtyard house is a city treasure that must be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   His father bought the house in 1950, a year after the communist
revolution, as a show of patriotism and faith in the new
government. But now the land his house sits on is wanted for a
shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's top academics and architects have rallied around his
cause. Even U.S. Ambassador Joseph Prueher recently paid a visit to
Zhao's house, taking in the rose bushes and intricate wood
carvings.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Scholars have pointed out the irony of the government spending
millions of dollars to renovate Ping An Avenue a couple of years
ago in Ming and Qing Dynasty styles _ with an outcome that has been
almost universally ridiculed by locals as fake-looking _ while just
a few yards away, an authentic Ming Dynasty house is slated for
demolition.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao's lawyer, Wu Jianzhong, believes that were Beijing to be
awarded the 2008 Olympics, something the government desperately
hopes to win, it could be disastrous for preservation if public
projects are undertaken too hastily.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll widen the streets and demolish a lot of houses,'' Wu
said. ``With the people all supporting the Olympics, this gives
officials an even bigger excuse to tear everything down.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Zhao Jingxin said there is plenty of room outside of Beijing's
old city center for commercial development and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one Beijing in the world,'' Zhao said. ``Fifty
years ago, we tore down the city walls. Now we regret it. If we
continue to demolish the courtyard homes, in 20 or 30 years, it
will be too late. We can't rebuild them.''

   HAVANA, Cuba _ It's a sweltering Sunday afternoon, the
temperature fueled by a blazing Caribbean sun and the scorching
African rhythms floating skyward from a narrow alley tucked in an
otherwise nondescript corner of this capital city.
</P>
<P>
   Drummers pound an incessant beat on tall wooden drums,
triggering waves of swaying, hypnotic dance in the crowd of some
200 people jammed into the sweaty space. A young Afro-Cuban woman
wearing a skin-tight body stocking festooned with bright flowers
shimmies, her body rolling with rhythm, while two tall, blonde
European women gently rock to the beat, faces entranced by the
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   A young American backpacker clad in sandals, shorts and T-shirt,
his chin darkened by a scraggly goatee, rolls his head, eyes
closed, as the drums crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   The throng somehow parts as tall, bearded Salvador Gonzalez
Escalona strolls calmly through the midst of an event he created.
Never breaking a sweat, he smiles as he speaks to acquaintances and
accepts handshakes from strangers, glowing with the energy of a
weekly gathering that has become a cultural and tourist magnet here
in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Hammel Alley,'' he tells a visitor in Spanish. ``We
are celebrating our African roots.''
</P>
<P>
   His arm swings out to encompass the two-story buildings crowding
the alley, which are covered with wild, flowing murals Gonzalez has
painted over the past decade to celebrate Cuba's mystical
Afro-Caribbean religion, Santeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our religion is very different from yours in the United
States,'' he said. ``It is a philosophy of the forces of nature. My
work responds to the codes and values of our African ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   The murals incorporate swirling circles, bright orange eyes,
geometric shapes, crosses, scribbled poems and homilies, densely
packed bodies and intriguing faces. Gonzalez is also a sculptor who
recycles the objects of everyday life: an ancient cash register
stands on a pedestal; an old black manual typewriter is nailed to a
door; a bathtub on wheels is welded to a frame arching over the
street, a scrap-iron seahorse towing the tub with metal traces.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro may have outlawed religion as the enemy of his
communist state, but Santeria still thrives in Cuba, and Salvador
Gonzalez has become one of its most visible advocates.
</P>
<P>
   He began his mural project in the early 1990s, when as a
struggling artist the idea of taking his paintings to the street on
a grand scale might have seemed risky. Cuba was _ and still is _
ruled by bureaucrats who often issue official decrees as to what
artistic forms and expressions are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 52, simply started painting. His neighbors loved his
work, and helped him scrounge paint supplies. They helped him build
scaffolds, and set up lights at night to let him work as late as
his muse provided inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the official types mostly overlooked him, then
gradually became fans. News of the growing mural spread by
word-of-mouth and it soon became a popular stop with the trickle of
tourists who began showing up in Cuba in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   By the late '90s, the mural was mostly finished, and Gonzalez
had carved out a spot as a hip representative of Cuban art and
culture. With tourism flourishing, he has become one of Cuba's most
notable artists. Magazine articles and press coverage led to
commissions overseas. He has painted a water tower in Germany, a
huge building in Caracas a homeless shelter in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   His subject is the mysterious world of Santeria. The religion
stems from the Yoruba people of West Africa, who kept their beliefs
when they were brought to the New World as slaves. Forbidden by
their masters from practicing their religion, they hid it by
incorporating the Catholic saints as representatives of each of the
Yoruban gods, called orishas.
</P>
<P>
   The orishas rule over every aspect of life and nature, from
relationships to the weather, to mountains, trees and the ocean.
Priests _ or babalawos _ instruct the faithful through sacrifice
and offerings, sometimes tossing pieces of coconut shells seeking
divination, or instructing their adherents to follow intricate,
secret rituals to chase away evil spirits or ensure good luck in
business or love.
</P>
<P>
   The religion also incorporates rhythmic drumming, dance and
trances. Followers can be seen swooning in religious ecstacy, their
bodies apparently possessed by fervor and spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has brought Santeria from Havana's back alleys into the
light of international attention, earning respect from art lovers
and the admiration of Santeria believers for preserving and
furthering a vital part of Cuban culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of life and music in his art,'' said Jacqui
Guillard, who visited Gonzalez's Sunday afternoon gathering
recently on a trip from Switzerland, where she is an artist. ``It's
fascinating and really shows the allure of Cuba _ it's such a
mysterious destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez clearly thrives on the attention, but insists his real
purpose is to keep alive the religion that has flourished in Cuba
for hundreds of years. He's happy that his art has provided a means
for people outside Cuba to understand a little more about Santeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am only a channel for the values of my ancestors,'' he said.
``My art is in homage to them, to their beliefs, to our culture.''

&HT;     E-ETIQUETTE FOR THE WORKPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One computer program for handling e-mail is
called Eudora. But there really ought to be a program called
Pandora, because the clumsy use of e-mail can open a world of
trouble for workers.
</P>
<P>
   First, consider a few results from a recent nationwide survey of
1,004 employees by Vault.com, an Internet career site:
</P>
<P>
   _ Although 70 percent of employees believe that e-mail improves
communication with their bosses, 51 percent say their tone is
sometimes misinterpreted as angry, abrupt or overly casual.
</P>
<P>
   _ About five out of six respondents regularly delete their
e-mails, and only one out of seven admit to forwarding sexually
explicit or otherwise improper e-mails to friends and co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Although 58 percent said they are not worried about employers
monitoring their e-mail use, 79 percent keep a separate account for
personal e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eighty percent say that for the majority of their business
correspondence, e-mail has replaced traditional mail, 72 percent
say it has replaced faxing and 45 percent say it has replaced phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   So what should you do to make better use of your e-mail? Here
are three suggestions (from me, not Vault):
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose your words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   I know this should fit in to the ``duh'' category, but a lot of
smart people make dumb mistakes when it comes to e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're sure that it's all right to be informal, you can
come across as a dolt if you misspell words and write the whole
thing as one run-on sentence. If you're joking and it's not obvious
that you're joking, don't joke. The payoff just isn't worth the
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Never say something in an e-mail (or voicemail) that you
wouldn't say to the person's face. E-mail makes it easy for you to
spoil a relationship in a few words. Before you send it, think
about how you would feel if you were the recipient instead of the
sender.
</P>
<P>
   Because busy people get dozens of e-mails a day, make your
subject heading as informative as possible. If you get cute or
vague, the person is liable to think it's junk mail and just trash
it.
</P>
<P>
   &Cx1f; _ Assume that someone is looking over your shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have a separate account, don't have anything pop up
on your office computer that you might get you fired.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean you should never use an office computer for
personal use. In these days of 60-hour workweeks, sometimes using
the office computer for a few personal items is only common sense.
If your employer is obnoxious about it, find a different employer.
</P>
<P>
   The same applies to joking back and forth with co-workers via
e-mail. A good boss wouldn't object, as long as you're not
offending anyone or wasting a lot of time. It's all a matter of
being reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   But using the office computer for job hunting is just plain
stupid. Ditto with pornography. You might as well attach a ``kick
me'' sign to your own butt.

<P>
   _ E-mail is a wonderful tool, if you use it wonderfully.
</P>
<P>
   It can eliminate a lot of meetings and interruptions, letting
people pass along routine information to colleagues and bosses. If
you choose your words carefully, it can also reduce
misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be a slave to your e-mail. Just because someone sends
you something doesn't mean you have to drop everything and read it
instantly. If your company values instant responses, it should have
a separate method for urgent correspondence, either with specially
designated e-mails, pagers or cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Once you read an e-mail, don't let it linger in your in-box;
soon you'll be scanning through dozens of e-mails to find what you
want. If you need to save it, set up a filing system, just as you
would with paper documents. Have folders for pending items that
need your attention, and other folders for e-mails you just want to
save in case they are ever needed.
</P>
<P>
   If someone sends you an important e-mail, respond to it
promptly, even if it's just a quick note that says, ``Got your
e-mail. I'll look it over as soon as I can.'' That way, people will
know it has been received and not accidentally deleted.
</P>
<P>
   Realize, too, that a lot of e-mails don't disappear just because
you delete them. Companies have backup systems, which is how many
``deleted'' e-mails end up in sexual harassment proceedings and
discrimination lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Old e-mails never die. They just end up in court.

CLINTON TELLS BARAK U.S. IS COMMITTED TO MIDDLE EAST PEACE
PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal _ President Clinton on Thursday called on
Israelis and Palestinians to ``do things that they have not done in
the past'' in an effort to conclude a historic peace agreement
between them. Clinton said the agreement was ``within view now.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after a meeting with Prime Minister Ehud Barak in this
seaside capital, Clinton also announced that he was sending
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to the Middle East next week
in an effort to ``work with both leaders on narrowing the gaps''
between them. He said further that he would meet soon with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official briefing reporters after the
meeting said that Clinton was prepared to convene a three-way Camp
David-style summit meeting in the Washington area with Barak and
Arafat but that much more work has to be done first.
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting, if held, would be modeled on the 1978
meeting held by President Carter at the Camp David presidential
retreat that pushed Israel and Egypt to conclude their landmark
peace treaty the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both leaders know from me and they know from their own
experience,'' Clinton said, ``that they now have to be prepared to
make an intense effort and to do things that they have not done in
the past with real courage and vision if we're actually going to
get a framework that deals with the outstanding issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The president added that he remained convinced that Israel and
the Palestinians would have the ``courage, the vision and the
ability'' to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States will do everything we can to help them pass
this milestone,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tough work,'' he added. ``If it were easy somebody
would have done it a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks underscored his frustration that the two sides
have not made more progress in completing a framework accord to
serve as a blueprint for a final deal in mid-September. The final
agreement will determine the size and shape of a Palestinian
entity, the future of Jerusalem and the fate of about 4 million
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Clinton dearly wants to conclude a peace
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians in the last months of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States will do everything it can to conclude a
historic agreement'' between Israel and the Palestinians, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright will travel to the Middle East directly from Kiev next
Monday, where Clinton will meet Ukrainian leaders before returning
to Washington, the senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The official added that the gaps are still so great that
Albright will probably need to make another trip to the region
before a three-way summit meeting could take place in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The senior administration official confirmed that the United
States has agreed to earmark $50 million of the $1.8 billion of
U.S. military aid budgeted for Israel to shore up Israel's border
with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israel estimates that a new defense line will cost from $300
million to $400 million. The withdrawal last week of Israel's army
from southern Lebanon after 18 years erased a buffer zone that had
shielded northern Israel from attacks by Lebanon across their
common border.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official added that Albright would not stop
in Syria during her visit to the Middle East. Talks between Israel
and Syria collapsed in January and have not resumed despite direct
consultations between Clinton and President Hafez Assad of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Barak before heading to Germany for the second
leg of a weeklong trip that is scheduled to be his last visit to
Europe as president. He will continue on to Russia and Ukraine
before heading home.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shortly before Thursday's meeting with Clinton, Barak
underscored the tense atmosphere between the Israelis and
Palestinians. He accused Arafat of stalling in their bilateral
talks, which have been quietly taking place in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent weeks, we have seen some dragging of feet in regard
to the running of negotiations,'' Barak told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We are trying to initiate a major move forward.''
That referred both to his talks with Clinton and the meeting
between peace negotiators that is scheduled to resume in Israel and
in Palestinian-run areas on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important at this crossroads to move forward with
all force on the framework agreement,'' the Israeli prime minister
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton spoke with Arafat by telephone for about
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat, who recently described the talks with Israel as
deadlocked, was said to be unhappy with ideas proposed by Israel in
Sweden, and he complained of Israeli intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Abu Rdaineh, a senior aide to Arafat, told Reuters in
Jerusalem that Arafat had ``informed President Clinton about the
current situation of the peace process, especially the current
stalemate and the deadlock it has reached.''

 &HT;    Inspired idea for American attractions: ban automobiles
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could hear the yodeling, as I recall. It wasn't coming from
a mountain top in the Swiss village. It was coming from the radio
in a window.
</P>
<P>
   Had there been yodeling from the mountain that day I visited
Zermatt, I would have heard it, as I could the shuffling of feet,
the wind in trees. What you couldn't hear was automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss town at the base of the Matterhorn has no cars, as if
there were any room for them.
</P>
<P>
   You have to park your car down the mountain and take the train.
Electric carts, horse-drawn sleighs and carriages are the only
transport allowed. It makes Zermatt, like Venice, a place where one
wants to be just for the being.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Zion National Park in Utah takes after Zermatt.
Automobiles are restricted in its most popular section. Park them
at the visitor's center. Take a shuttle. Take a day pack. Enjoy the
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sound of the Virgin River does not compete with
carbon-hoofed horses. Now visitors, 3,000 carloads on a peak day,
do not have to arm-wrestle for the 450 parking spaces at trails and
overlooks.
</P>
<P>
   It was long overdue. Though one of the appealing things about
Zion is the ability to wind down into a steep, red-rock canyon,
there's no reason why visitors should do the driving. The parks
service can do that, freeing other eyes for gawking.
</P>
<P>
   This is a major development that ought to be widespread. Plans
are being formalized to limit access by automobile at Yosemite
National Park and at the south rim of the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Good. We've reduced some of our nation's more precious places to
drive-through at the Jack in the Box. All that's missing is the
clown's head.
</P>
<P>
   Putting cars in their place _ namely, in a lot at the visitor's
center _ is the best thing some parks could do. Obviously it's
impossible to ban cars from something as massive as Yellowstone
Park. That means, unfortunately, that despite its grandeur
Yellowstone at times has the feel of a General Motors assembly
line.
</P>
<P>
   With the air pollution problems at the Grand Canyon and in some
of California's scenic gems, reining in automotive traffic makes
more and more sense. But there are many other reasons to take the
Zion route. Chief is that people will enjoy the park more when they
turn off the A/C and the stereo and get out.
</P>
<P>
   They will get smells, sights and sounds they otherwise would
miss.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian meccas
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most of the world's greatest tourist attractions are
those where the car meets its match. Consider New York City. You
bet, people drive in New York, but most quickly find alternatives.
They also quickly find the allure of the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   It takes but a day in New York to realize that because so many
are on foot, what you have isn't one massive, suffocating city but
hundreds of little villages in which ``down the block'' is the
chief destination.
</P>
<P>
   By and large the automobile is irrelevant to many New Yorkers.
For one reason, as in Zermatt, as in Zion, where do you park?
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason to carve away at natural treasures to make
room for more cars. We have come to think that whatever is scenic
or historic has to be situated so that we can roll down the window
and touch it. That allows us to speed on to the next scenic
treasure.
</P>
<P>
   That mind-set was evident when Zion began limiting cars in May.
Visitors complained about delays waiting for shuttles. I can think
of few places where I'd rather be delayed than magnificent Zion.
But some people didn't see it as a blessing. They're conditioned to
packing a lifetime of sights into a weekend, leaving time for HBO
at the motel.
</P>
<P>
   If we do it right, people will start changing their notion of
what scenic places are about _ that serenity once again is part of
the beauty.

 HEALTHY 20-MINUTE MENUS: BRAISED CHICKEN, FENNEL AND RED PEPPERS

<P>
   There is one unusual ingredient in today's menu for braised
chicken with a side of green beans and mushrooms, but many
specialty food shops carry olive paste or you can buy it by mail on
the Web from a food dot-com such as www.tavolo.com. Olive paste
comes in green or black and keeps indefinitely in the refrigerator.
Which color you use is really up to you.
</P>
<P>
   If you are lucky enough to shop in a market that stocks the
tiny, thin French version of green beans, you may decide you want
to spend the extra money on haricots verts because they are so much
more tender than conventional green beans. Whatever your
opportunity, whatever your decision, green beans in either form are
a natural for mushrooms, and the touch of olive paste perks up the
otherwise fairly neutral flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Green beans are always better steamed than boiled, which seems
to take the life out of them. Cook them only until they are tender
crisp so that they maintain their texture and color. There is
nothing more depressing than grayish green beans.
</P>
<P>
   The green beans are just a side to the chicken with fennel, the
kind of main dish in which the supporting players _ the fennel,
peppers and onions _ are even more important than the starring
player, the chicken. They are what gives chicken, an otherwise
bland tasting bird, its wonderful flavor. And if you are one those
people who prefer the vegetables to the chicken you can add more of
them and reduce the amount of chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Since this meal offers no serious source of starch, I recommend
some crusty, country bread
</P>

 &HT;    TAX RULING IN TREE CASE COULD HAVE WIDE EFFECT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JERRY MOSKAL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Okeechobee, Fla., citrus grower has been denied
deductions for tree-planting expenses in a U.S. Tax Court opinion
that the grower's attorney says could affect farmers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The decision upheld an Internal Revenue Service denial of $1.4
million in tax deductions for 1992-94 that Palaez and Sons Inc.
claimed for planting and nurturing 39,382 orange, grapefruit and
tangerine trees into producing citrus groves.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1986 law, Congress denied annual deductions for
production expenses to farmers and certain other businesses that
did not produce a marketable product within two years. Instead,
these producers had to capitalize and depreciate these expenses
over a period of years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Philip A. Diamond, an Orlando tax attorney for the
company, the 1986 law also ordered the IRS to issue regulations on
how these expenses should be claimed over time. he said he was
disappointed that the Tax Court ruling didn't fault the IRS for
failing to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Congress passed the law, (Ronald) Reagan was president
and the Berlin Wall was standing,'' Diamond said in a telephone
interview. ``It's been 14 years, and still the IRS has not issued
any guidance on what the productive period is for crops.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 27-page opinion, Judge Joel Gerber ruled the IRS was
correct in finding that Palaez couldn't use its own experience to
determine that its citrus trees came into production within the
two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Petitioner's argument that the corporation should be allowed
to use its individual experience because (the respondent failed to
issue regulations or guidance as to the national weighted average
preproduction period for citrus trees is without merit,'' Gerber
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Palaez branched out into citrus production from cattle ranching
in 1989 when it planted 39,382 trees. The firm said that despite a
1989 frost that destroyed half of those trees, the remaining trees
produced a $14,600 net harvest in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gerber ruled, such modest results failed to prove that
the pre-production period for citrus trees was less than the two
years required to qualify for yearly expense deductions. The
company said it did not claim the expense deductions until the
1992-94 tax years because it was waiting for the IRS to issue crop
growing regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to appeal that's for sure,'' said Christina
Hooker, an officer and tax representative of Palaez. ``It's not
fair. To date, the (U.S.) Treasury still has not come up with
regulations. Right now, I'm in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Diamond was more cautious. ``We're going to review our
options'' to appeal, he said. ``We feel the IRS should have
promulgated weighted averages for citrus growers as Congress
directed. How can a farmer comply with the regulations if they have
not been issued?''
</P>
<P>
   He said Gerber's ruling would have implications not only for
citrus growers, but for apple growers and farmers of other crops
with long pre-production periods.
</P>
<P>
   As a so-called Subchapter S corporation, Palaez's owners pay
taxes on their share of company profits rather than the firm
itself. Subchapter S corporations must have 35 owners or less.
</P>
<P>
   An IRS spokesman said the agency does not comment on pending tax
cases.

   ELIAN-RULING _ ATLANTA _ A federal appeals court sided with
Elian Gonzalez's father today in the 6-month-old international
custody battle, ruling that immigration officials were entitled to
deny an asylum hearing for the Cuban boy. Under the ruling, Elian
must remain in the United States for 14 days to give his Miami

 &HT;    TAX RULING IN TREE CASE COULD HAVE WIDE EFFECT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JERRY MOSKAL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Okeechobee, Fla., citrus grower has been denied
deductions for tree-planting expenses in a U.S. Tax Court opinion
that the grower's attorney says could affect farmers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The decision upheld an Internal Revenue Service denial of $1.4
million in tax deductions for 1992-94 that Palaez and Sons Inc.
claimed for planting and nurturing 39,382 orange, grapefruit and
tangerine trees into producing citrus groves.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1986 law, Congress denied annual deductions for
production expenses to farmers and certain other businesses that
did not produce a marketable product within two years. Instead,
these producers had to capitalize and depreciate these expenses
over a period of years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Philip A. Diamond, an Orlando tax attorney for the
company, the 1986 law also ordered the IRS to issue regulations on
how these expenses should be claimed over time. he said he was
disappointed that the Tax Court ruling didn't fault the IRS for
failing to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Congress passed the law, (Ronald) Reagan was president
and the Berlin Wall was standing,'' Diamond said in a telephone
interview. ``It's been 14 years, and still the IRS has not issued
any guidance on what the productive period is for crops.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 27-page opinion, Judge Joel Gerber ruled the IRS was
correct in finding that Palaez couldn't use its own experience to
determine that its citrus trees came into production within the
two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Petitioner's argument that the corporation should be allowed
to use its individual experience because (the respondent failed to
issue regulations or guidance as to the national weighted average
preproduction period for citrus trees is without merit,'' Gerber
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Palaez branched out into citrus production from cattle ranching
in 1989 when it planted 39,382 trees. The firm said that despite a
1989 frost that destroyed half of those trees, the remaining trees
produced a $14,600 net harvest in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gerber ruled, such modest results failed to prove that
the pre-production period for citrus trees was less than the two
years required to qualify for yearly expense deductions. The
company said it did not claim the expense deductions until the
1992-94 tax years because it was waiting for the IRS to issue crop
growing regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to appeal that's for sure,'' said Christina
Hooker, an officer and tax representative of Palaez. ``It's not
fair. To date, the (U.S.) Treasury still has not come up with
regulations. Right now, I'm in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Diamond was more cautious. ``We're going to review our
options'' to appeal, he said. ``We feel the IRS should have
promulgated weighted averages for citrus growers as Congress
directed. How can a farmer comply with the regulations if they have
not been issued?''
</P>
<P>
   He said Gerber's ruling would have implications not only for
citrus growers, but for apple growers and farmers of other crops
with long pre-production periods.
</P>
<P>
   As a so-called Subchapter S corporation, Palaez's owners pay
taxes on their share of company profits rather than the firm
itself. Subchapter S corporations must have 35 owners or less.
</P>
<P>
   An IRS spokesman said the agency does not comment on pending tax
cases.

   CUBAN-BOY (Miami) _ A federal appeals court on Thursday sided
with the father of Elian Gonzalez, rejecting a request by the Cuban
boy's Miami relatives that he be granted an asylum hearing with
immigration officials. A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals said the INS decision that only a parent can act
for his 6-year-old child in immigration matters ``comes within the
range of reasonable choices.'' It said that held true even if the
parent was in another country and the child was in the United
States. The ruling requires boy to stay in the United States for at
least 14 days more pending the filing of an appeal. By Rick Bragg.

<P>
   Second in an occasional series on millennial London.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go into the belly of The Body. Watch out _ the gastric
juices are flowing and a whole lot more is going on!
</P>
<P>
   The Body is a shimmering seven-story structure inside London's
Millennium Dome. The structure, worthy of an art museum, depicts a
male and female figure in a gentle, reclining embrace. Visitors
walk through enclosed spaces, up an escalator, and then down and
out, visiting arms, legs, a pumping heart, and even a wisecracking,
fez-wearing brain along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Body is one of 14 exhibit-filled ``zones'' within the Dome,
which will be open this year only. The multimillion-dollar
attraction was greeted with withering reviews from the British
press, but word of mouth has been kinder. Every attraction may not
be a stunner, but at the Dome you can explore the future,
experience visual tricks such as watching yourself grow older, gaze
at a 21-karat blue diamond, and _ in the center of all the activity
_ see a live show with 200 performers that includes fireworks,
bungee jumpers on stilts, and a graceful ballet high in the sky.
Here are a few fab facts:
</P>
<P>
   --The Dome has the world's biggest roof, measuring some 25
acres. It is, in fact, the largest domed structure in the world _
twice the size of the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   --The inside volume of more than 6 million square feet would
hold 12.8 million barrels of beer, or 18,000 double-decker buses.
If inverted under Niagara Falls, the Dome would take more than 10
minutes to fill with water.
</P>
<P>
   --Its futuristic masts lean at three times the angle of the
Tower of Pisa and are 131 feet taller.
</P>
<P>
   --With 1 million square feet of fabric, it is the largest fabric
structure in the world. It is also the strongest fabric building,
able to support a jumbo jet _ or the force of James Bond plummeting
from the sky onto the Dome roof in the movie ``The World Is Not
Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   (Dome tickets are about $32 for adults and $26 for children
5-15; children younger than 5 are free. Tickets are sold in a
number of places and are part of many travel packages. There are
various ways to get to the Dome, which is in Greenwich, but one of
the most pleasant is a 45-minute riverboat ride down the Thames,
beginning near the London Eye, passing by Big Ben and the Tower of
London, and going under the Tower Bridge. Round-trip tickets are
about $13 for adults and $9 for children. For more information
about the Dome or all of London, call the British Tourist Authority
at 800-462-2748 or visit www.LondonTown.com.)

</P>
<P>
   Who knew? When celebrities are publicizing a movie or play in
London, they want to be recognized and stay in a high-profile
hotel. But when they want to escape from it all, some stay at the
Cliveden Town House, a lushly landscaped 35-room hotel at Cadogen
Gardens. Sometimes the stars are recognizable, but at other times,
we're told, the celebs look so different that few would know them.
(And, no, the hotel won't tell you who stays there.) For more

   Fascinating fact: Because of Denver's mile-high altitude, water
boils at 202 degrees instead of 212. Thus it takes four minutes to
boil a three-minute egg.

Nepal to a choice of European cities, then back to Boston. The site

   Netting a first: Pennsylvania became the first state in the
country to put the state's Web site _ www.state.pa.us _ on license

   Take a bathrobe home . . . legally: There's nothing rocky about

   WASHINGTON _ Sean Conley, a slender 12-year-old from Newark,
Calif., confidently cruised through three more rounds of
increasingly tougher words Thursday, the final day of the 73rd
National Spelling Bee. He correctly spelled Mackinaw, ferriferous
and luftmensch.
</P>
<P>
   Sean, who is sponsored by the San Francisco Examiner, took
several deep breaths and rocked from side to side before the word
pronouncer issued his first challenge: Mackinaw, which is a short,
belted coat of heavy fabric.
</P>
<P>
   As he did Wednesday when he survived the first three rounds of
the bee, Sean asked that the word be repeated a few times for
alternate pronunciations. Then he asked its origin and its use in a
sentence before acing its spelling. He was among 110 spellers who
remained of the original 248 who competed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   During a break after the fourth round, the home-schooled seventh
grader appeared calm and confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth round is usually pretty hard, but this was
easier,'' he said, adding that he knew the words his competitors
had been asked earlier in the round _ ``all except for a couple.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean said he kept quizzing the pronouncer about Mackinaw ``to
make sure I'm hearing it right and to give me some time to think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The technique worked for him Wednesday when he successfully
knocked off nyctalopia, or the inability to see at twilight;
discomfiture, which means frustration or confusion, and floppety,
which means soft and flexible.
</P>
<P>
   After the fourth round, the number of spellers had dwindled to
64.
</P>
<P>
   Sean's mother Bry, who teaches him at home, scurried to the
aisle to remind him to tuck his shirt in, gave him the old theater
morale-booster, ``break a leg,'' and then added, ``Or, break a
tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth round, Sean tackled ferriferous, which means
containing iron, This time he barely hesitated before nailing that
word too.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth round, he easily spelled luftmensch, which is a
German word meaning a dreamer or an impractical person with no
definite trade, business or income. The word was easy for him
because his mother, who majored in German at the University of New
Mexico, has been teaching him the language.
</P>
<P>
   Sean's father Mike was sitting in the back row at the crowded
auditorium of the Grand Hyatt Hotel here where the bee was held. He
said he was ``just trying to remain calm.''
</P>
<P>
   The final day is more of a nail-biter, he said, because his son
actually has a chance to better his ninth-place tie in the national
bee last year.
</P>
<P>
   The bee is sponsored by E.W. Scripps Co.

<P>
   Don't be surprised if you see something weird in the list of
local venues. Like many other arenas throughout the country, the
former Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre has changed its name _ and gone
blatantly corporate.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor venue in Laguna Hills is now called the Verizon
Wireless Amphitheatre, the results of a recent merger of three cell
phone companies. But don't worry; it's still the same joint.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a list of forthcoming pop, jazz, classical, theater,
dance and art events.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for many of these are available through Ticketmaster
locations, which you'll find at all Wherehouse, Tower, Ritmo Latino
and Robinsons-May outlets, unless otherwise stated. To charge by
phone, call (213) 480-3232 or (714) 740-2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN _ It was as close to a photo-op as Ralph Nader was
going to get.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent sunny afternoon, the famed consumer advocate,
surrounded by a moving scrum of supporters and reporters, was
walking down busy Church Street on his way to speak at the Yale
University Co-op.
</P>
<P>
   Some passersby stopped to see what the fuss was about, and,
spotting the gangly, professorial man, some let out exclamations of
recognition: ``Woo! Ralph Nader! Yeah!'' Others looked puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   Did Nader, who is running for president on the Green Party
ticket, stop to wave to his fans or to shake a few potential
converts' hands? Did he explain himself to the uninitiated? Did he
squeeze a shoulder or two and scatter ``Remember me in Novembers?''
</P>
<P>
   No, no, and absolutely not. Head down, stoop-shouldered,
clutching his trademark stuffed brown folder, Nader appeared
oblivious to it all. His people _ a crowd of more than 200, mostly
elderly residents and young followers _ were waiting for him in the
bookstore nearby. Nader, remarkably devoid of charisma despite
nearly 40 years in the public eye, wasn't interested in introducing
himself to the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't parade in front of people,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, no way to win the White House. But this is
also a candidate who doesn't talk much of victory in November _ not
of victory in the usual sense. Nader has other goals: Building up a
new progressive party and making mainstream Democrats squirm. He
wanted the same things when he stood for election four years ago,
also on the Green Party ticket, with little effort and even less
success (he drew less than one percent of the vote).
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Nader has a good deal more money in the bank,
some of it from activist celebrities like Paul Newman and Susan
Sarandon. And the contest between the two major party candidates is
so close that, if current poll numbers persist, Nader could prove
quite a headache for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Zogby International poll showed Nader drawing 4.4
percent of voters nationally. Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan,
the higher-profile third party alternative, attracted 2.1 percent.
The margin by which Republican Governor George W. Bush led Gore was
only 3.6 percent. And two of every three votes that Nader attracts,
said pollster John Zogby, come from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's showing is even stronger on the West Coast, where Gore
is counting on strong support. In California, where Nader has been
involved in tort and HMO reform initiatives in recent years, he
attracts 9 percent. In Oregon, he drew 7 percent. Though only 4
percent of Ohio voters said they would vote for Nader, a recent
Ohio Poll found he had the highest net favorability rating of all
the candidates (Bush had the highest outright positive rating, but
the Texas governor's negative rating was also high).
</P>
<P>
   Gore finished third in that survey, which is fine with Nader,
who lost faith in Democrats years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned with Al Gore,'' he told an audience in
Worcester last week. ``He refuses to compete with me over the
issues. Is there anything keeping Al Gore from coming out strong on
labor laws? Every four years (the parties) get more and more alike.
The only language they understand is to deny them your vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader derides Gore, and President Bill Clinton, for their
campaign fund-raising practices, for failing to fight hard enough
for universal health care, and on many other issues. Nader calls
Bush the ``corporate welfare king,'' for making huge profits from
his share of the Texas Rangers after government money helped build
a new stadium for the baseball team. He scoffs at Bush for staging
photo opportunities with children when Texas has the second-highest
hunger rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The plague-on-both-your-houses rhetoric played very well with
audiences on Nader's recent swing through New England.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, most people hardly seemed to need convincing.
Nader's crowds were jammed with citizens already hostile to big
business and to politicians they view as selling out to corporate
interests. In Boston, Nader joined a rally on the Common against
the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, decrying the
standardized exam as a way for test-framers to encroach on public
education. In New Haven, he spoke before residents fighting a new
multimillion dollar, government-subsidized mall.
</P>

   As he has all over the country, Nader had full command of the
minute details of each cause, using local issues as a preface to
his major themes.
</P>
<P>
   In Hartford, he visited picketing workers at the Avery Heights
retirement community, rattling off details of the dispute, decrying
the disparity between their lower salaries and those in other
nearby nursing homes, and the generous government subsidies used to
build the private, 43-acre community. From there, he launched into
an indictment of ``greedy'' corporations, their grip on government,
and the weakness of organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to light a fire under the AFL-CIO,'' Nader told the
picketers, ``so that if they endorse someone like Al Gore, they get
thumped in return.''
</P>
<P>
   At the podium, Nader is a good deal more humorous and
self-assured than he is on the street. He packs his addresses with
rhetoric designed to elicit outrage in even the most complacent
liberal: less than 10 percent of private employees belong to labor
unions, the lowest rate in 60 years; 47 million workers make less
than $10 an hour; Bill Gates has as much money as the poorest 120
million Americans' combined. And on it goes.
</P>
<P>
   His pitch draws gasps from his audiences, composed of older
voters who remember his days as a high-profile consumer advocate,
and young leftists disillusioned with mainstream politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nader burst into public view with his 1965 book, ``Unsafe at Any
Speed'' which exposed General Motors's and other auto makers' scant
attention to car safety. Nader also played a prominent role in the
creation of auto safety laws, the Freedom of Information Act, the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the
Environmental Protection Agency, among others.
</P>
<P>
   His profile is much lower nationally these days, but Nader
insists people are still as concerned about corporate corruption,
labor issues and equality now as they were in the 1960s. Instead,
he said, those issues _ along with his own consumer movement _ have
been edged to the margin by news media obsessed with such
spectacles as the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the trial of O.J.
Simpson. ``It is the Roman Circus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Younger supporters admire Nader because of his combativeness and
disrespect for mainstream politics. He is ``retro-cool'' said
pollster Zogby. His savaging of Bush (``He was born on third base,
and he thought he hit a triple,'' Nader says, borrowing a zinger
from former Texas Governor Ann Richards once aimed at Bush) and
Gore (``He is, shall we say, wooden?'') prove big hits with college
students.
</P>
<P>
   Get corporations out of politicians' ears, Nader said, and such
miracles as prison reform, solutions to poverty, and decent
education for all children will follow. As president, he said, he
would introduce public financing of elections, provide universal
health care, repeal laws which he says hinder trade unions, and
crack down on corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Ralph Nader knows he won't be president. But he hopes
that mounting this campaign will move the public agenda closer to
his priorities. He wants his candidacy to build up the Green Party,
so it will be able to field more candidates for state and local
office. If he wins the nomination at the party convention in Denver
on June 24, as expected, and garners 5 percent of the vote in
November, the Greens will be eligible for federal election funds in
2004.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't joined the party himself, however. In some states,
rival factions roil the Greens, and Nader doesn't want to get
involved in any of that: ``I want to look outward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader grew up in Winsted, Conn., the son of Lebanese immigrants
who fed him a steady diet of instructive aphorisms and civic
values. They often took him to town meetings, to teach him the
importance of political involvement.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 10, Nader said, he came home from school and his
father, a restaurant owner, demanded of him ``Well, Ralph, what did
you learn today? Did you learn how to think? Or did you learn how
to believe?''
</P>
<P>
   Nader brought a religous devotion to his causes. When General
Motors hired a private detective to investigate him in the
mid-1960s, there was nothing to find. He sued the company for
invasion of privacy, and used the settlement to start his first
watchdog group. He still lives an ascetic life, donating much of
his speaking and writing fees to his causes. He doesn't bother with
such trifles as natty suits and fancy restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't make money, and when you go out to eat with him,
it's usually a cafeteria,'' said his Harvard Law School classmate
Richard Goodwin. ``He has total monastic dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Nader usually stays overnight with
friends and relatives, and has his assistant drive him long
distances in a rental car. But this time around, such frugality is
more a matter of habit than necessity. Nader said the campaign had
raised about $600,000 so far, and it expected to raise about $5
million, including matching funds. Goodwin, a longtime Democratic
stalwart, hosted a fund-raiser for Nader on May 15 at his home in
Concord, Mass. He is just the kind of voter Nader hopes to attract
in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats can't just decide that the progressive elements in
their own party don't have to be paid attention to,'' Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, actor Paul Newman held a fundraiser for Nader in
his Manhattan apartment, which is expected to net between $30,000
and $40,000. Others have followed, including Phil Donahue, Susan
Sarandon, singers Bonnie Raitt and Willie Nelson, and even actor
Warren Beatty, who until recently harbored presidential ambitions
of his own. Nader is especially proud of Beatty's support,
declaring in New Haven: ``Let the defections expand and thrive!''
</P>
<P>
   But those who would teach Democrats a lesson today might not be
willing to actually pull the lever for Nader come November,
particularly if the contest between Bush and Gore remains close.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, who do you pull a vote away from?'' asked
Kelly Hanna, a registered Green Party member who heard Nader speak
in New Haven and admires him. ``I agree with making the Democrats
know where they came from, but where do you make your impact?''
</P>
<P>
   Even Sean Corvino, a young voter in a T-shirt with a picture of
Unabomber Ted Kaczynski on it (he says he admires Kaczynski's
writing, not his bombings), said he was worried about the same
thing after Nader's speech in the bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush looks like he'll win, I'll support Gore, and if it
looks like Gore is good to go, I'll lean more to the left,''
Corvino said.
</P>
<P>
   And Goodwin, angry as he is at the Democrats for abandoning
progressives and young voters, said he will probably vote for Gore
after all, because the election looks close.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said it was far too early to worry
about Nader's impact on the Democratic vote. He said he was
confident liberal voters would rally behind the Vice President.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a `paper or plastic' choice when it comes down to
Gore and Bush,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader would probably attract more voters if he were able to
participate in the debates, he said. To be included, he must poll
15 percent, which seems unlikely. But he has vowed to fight Bush
and Gore in any way he can. In any case, he is philosophical about
his run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people look at third party starts as if the first
election is a final test,'' he told one audience. ``I don't think
about that. I'm very incremental. I'm a patient person.''

   TONY-AWARDS (New York) _ Unless there are some major surprises _

many people say they simply don't understand. Confused? You should
be. It has been that kind of year on Broadway, an odd mishmash of

Argenteuil'' at the National Gallery of Art, is the umpteenth

   MONTREAL _ Some of them had risen before the sun, either too
wise or too sad to sleep late on a morning like Wednesday's. They
knew all the flags would be at half-staff; that the National
Assembly would not be in session; that many of Old Montreal's
streets would be sealed off by barricades; and that when they heard
the Notre Dame Basilica bells ring just after noon, they wouldn't
have to ask, ``For whom do the bells toll?''
</P>
<P>
   The fans and the bells were for Maurice Richard, the late hockey
star who was being eulogized in a state funeral.
</P>
<P>
   As this happened, helicopters circled the area. Photographers
positioned themselves atop the Bank of Montreal (a 10-story
building). Le Journal de Montreal sent three reporters and six
photographers into a crowd of thousands, trying to find more
stories about _ with all apologies to Roger Clemens and Raghib
Ismail _ the original Rocket.

   There were boys and girls. Hommes and femmes. Owners of
expensive homes as well as the homeless. All of them could not fit
into the spectacular basilica, where 3,000 people sat and listened
as the Archbishop of Montreal talked about a man who was to French
Canadians what Joe Louis was to black Americans. So thousands of
fans, more fans than most Americans would dare imagine, stood
outside near a plaza and watched the ceremony on a huge video
screen.
</P>
<P>
   One man wore a tattered Canadiens T-shirt and held a Habs flag
above his head for at least two hours. There was a Canadian flag
with Richard's No. 9 centered in the leaf. Bike messengers rested
and watched. There were sounds of rich organs and mournful
falsettos. There was even an attentive, shirtless man wearing a
Yankees cap.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket played his last game 40 years ago, meaning that many
of the people who attended his funeral never saw him play. But
that's only half of the intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   True, some fans were here to say goodbye to the man who, for 18
years, took the ice in a fury. Old-timers tell you about his eyes,
how they were as round as two full moons. When in pursuit of the
puck, his graphite eyes would expand, as if he were an enraged man
trying to emphasize a point. He scored 626 goals in his career, 544
in the regular season. His team won eight Stanley Cups, including
five in a row from 1956-60. In 1952, he was bloodied and concussed
in Game 7 of the Cup Final against the Bruins. He recovered, scored
the winning goal, and passed out again.
</P>
<P>
   There were those who came here to remember that.
</P>
<P>
   And there were also those who came to see a couple of
disquieting burials: Richard's and a part of a culture's. Richard,
who had stomach cancer and Parkinson's disease, died Saturday
morning. He was 78. He took some of the defiance of the 1940s and
'50s with him. To many French Quebecers, Richard made an implicit
political statement each time he played. He was fearless and
relentless. He never asked those of English descent to respect him;
he demanded it. The fans' love for him was so intense that there
was a riot here on his behalf in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Richard's funeral procession passed Ste. Catherine
Street. It was a peaceful ceremony. But 45 years ago, the street's
stores were aflame in his name. He had been suspended for punching
an official during a game in Boston. League president Clarence
Campbell decided that the Rocket should miss the regular season and
the playoffs, in addition to losing a chance at his first scoring
title.
</P>
<P>
   The next Canadiens game, on St. Patrick's Day, was in Montreal.
Campbell attended and was pelted with tomatoes. One fan approached
and punched him in the face. When the scene became too violent, the
Habs were forced to forfeit. Fans spilled into the street and began
what came to be known as the Richard Riots.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez was recently suspended five games. Imagine: Sox
fans looting Back Bay in the Pedro Riots. It's hard to envision
because there is no current United States equivalent to Richard.
There isn't an athlete in this country who would elicit the praise
that Richard did. The man quieted an entire province Wednesday. Out
of respect to Richard, the National Assembly decided that it would
do no business. More than 115,000 people went to the Molson Centre
Tuesday and viewed his body, lying in an open casket.
</P>
<P>
   He could be unrelenting when the subject was hockey. He once
ripped Campbell in a newspaper column, basically calling him an
Anglo with an (anti-French) angle. He said Gordie Howe didn't score
many significant goals; Howe in turn called him a bastard.
</P>
<P>
   No one mentioned that when Howe left Old Montreal and boarded a
bus. There were several chartered buses going Howe's way,
transporting NHL officials, special guests and extended family
members to the cemetery. A few Canadiens loyalists heckled Howe as
he left. He smiled. The Rocket probably would have wanted it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   As the dignitaries left, many fans stayed behind, still waving
their flags. Some came here out of family obligation: Their parents
loved Richard and they feel they must, too. It's like voting for a
certain political party because that's the way your parents voted.
</P>
<P>
   Some came here to make a statement of their own; they came to
honor Richard as a hero. Heroism is often linked with unassailable
behavior when, in fact, that has nothing to do with it. Heroes are
determined by their audience. And Wednesday's audience said plenty
about heroism, simply by showing up and listening to the bells
toll.

DESPERATE IN THE CITY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City'' has gotten by for a few years on a general
assumption that it's smart and sexy, but desperation is hardly sexy
or smart, and that's the sitcom's overriding text and subtext. The
four female lead characters like to pretend that they're
sophisticated and in charge, but they're usually miserable, whether
they're in a relationship or not, and the gags are usually of the
most rudimentary sexual nature, just gussied up in HBO finery.
</P>
<P>
   It's swell _ or would that be, in this show's vernacular,
swollen? _ that women have their own forum to kvetch about what
louses men are and how there aren't any decent guys to be found out
there these days. But turn the tables on this show _ have guys
making the same sort of leering observations about women _ and the
show would be downright stomach-turning.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the guys on TV who might make such complaints aren't
fabulously leggy, don't wear strappy shoes and rarely bare their
breasts (at least, no one wants them to). ``Sex and the City's''
cast's pulchritude helps a lot of viewers get over the fact that
the writing, simply put, is limp and hackneyed and runs amok with
unlimited and ultimately tiresome sexual puns.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Samantha (Kim Cattrall) coming onto a fireman _ ``Hello,
911! I'm on fire!'' Samantha, again, upon hearing a guy is from
Lower Manhattan: ``I'd like to show him my lower Manhattan.''
Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), on sex with a politician: ``I had my
political consciousness raised.'' Boy, when I hear women talk like
that on TV, my hands just lunge for, uh, the remote.
</P>
<P>
   The new season begins, roughly, where our young heroines have
always been: Looking for love in all the trendy places. Carrie
hooks up with a politician on the campaign trail _ what politician
in his right mind, even one in New York, would be seen in public
with a woman who writes a sex column? In next week's episode, he
reveals his kinky predilection that results in sitcomy behavior of
the basest sort _ again, we ask: What politician in his right mind,
even one in New York, would reveal his kinky sexual predilections
to a sex columnist? (Carrie's columns _ delivered in ubiquitous
voice-overs _ may be clever coming from an actress's mouth, but
they'd seem awfully trite from the pages of a Big Apple tabloid.)
</P>
<P>
   Smutty Samantha, as you've no doubt guessed, dates a fireman.
Instead of exploring the briefly broached, vaguely interesting
conundrum that he's her intellectual inferior but they're sexual
equals, the show naturally goes for the easy gag _ she's caught
with her clothes off in the firehouse when an alarm goes off. Next
week, she dates a short guy who similarly satisfies her and is the
brunt of similarly obvious jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte (Kristin Davis) continues her search _ either poignant
or pathetic, depending on your sexual politics _ for Mr. Right;
she's determined to get married this year, which will apparently
provide the series with a running subplot. As will Miranda's
(Cynthia Nixon) decision on whether she and her boyfriend should go
steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City'' has its adherents, and even earned a couple
of key Emmy nominations last year (that it's won a Golden Globe
merely suggests that Samantha's been hanging with the Hollywood
Foreign Press). But strip away (and that's not hard to do on this
show) all the gloss and polish _ both the characters' and the
production's _ and it's hard to see it as anything more than just
another string of tired old naughty jokes. &QL;

ROUTED IN LEBANON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no putting a pretty face on Israel's humiliating rout
in southern Lebanon last week, but that didn't stop Prime Minister
Ehud Barak from trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel's presence in Lebanon tied its hands to some extent,''
he declared last Thursday. ``But from now on, there are no limits
on a tough Israeli response to all aggression against it.'' The day
before, he boasted that the troops had departed Lebanon ``without a
scratch.'' This, he said, ``is a happy day.''
</P>
<P>
   A happy day?
</P>
<P>
   Pursued by a few hundred Hezbollah guerrillas, Israeli soldiers
flee Lebanon in a panic. In their haste to get out, they leave
behind armored vehicles, rocket launchers, and ammunition, which
the Shiite militiamen chasing them promptly seize. ``As they
giddily rode abandoned Israeli tanks through village after
village,'' The New York Times reports on Page 1 the next morning
alongside a photo of triumphant Islamist fighters, ``they laid
waste to Israel's plan for an orderly, scheduled withdrawal.''
Meanwhile mortars are fired at the towns of the Upper Galilee;
residents are forced to sleep in bomb shelters. Vowing to
``continue fighting as if there had been no withdrawal at all,''
Hezbollah sweeps down to the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' gloats Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader,
``is the first victory in 50 years of Arab-Israeli conflict!'' If
he means that it is the first time that Israel has been forced to
retreat, with no peace agreement or security guarantee, from
territory it had occupied in self-defense, he is entirely correct.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the worst of it.
</P>
<P>
   With Israel out, Syria's hegemony over Lebanon is complete. The
tens of thousands of Syrian troops who for 25 years have occupied
the northern two-thirds of the country are now free to extend their
control over all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's deployment of surface-to-air missile batteries in
Lebanon was one of the events that triggered Israel's invasion in
1982. With Hezbollah _ protected by Syria, financed by Iran _ once
more at Israel's door, how long will it be before such threatening
moves resume? As Israel cut and ran last week, Lebanese radio
hinted at the bloodshed to come. ``Yarun is now liberated,'' one
broadcaster said, ``and I'm looking over into occupied Palestine.''
That is, into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Even that is not the worst of it.
</P>
<P>
   The worst _ the very worst _ is that in its rush to leave
Lebanon, Israel left its Christian and moderate Muslim allies in
the South Lebanon Army to the tender mercies of Hezbollah and
Damascus. Within hours, the ``ethnic cleansing'' had reportedly
begun. In Qolaia, two Christian men were said to have been
kidnapped and executed by the militiamen. In Marjayoun, homes were
torched; in Burj el-Mluk and Kawkaba, churches. The Orthodox bishop
of Marjayoun and the Maronite bishop of Sidon pleaded publicly for
help in stopping the ``acts of persecution and aggression taking
place.''
</P>
<P>
   For 25 years, at great risk to themselves, the men of the SLA
helped keep Israel's northern towns safe from terrorism. The
enclave they patrolled was the closest thing Lebanon had to a free
zone, a small swath of territory not dominated by Syria or Shi'ite
extremists. Israelis are famous for never leaving a man behind. But
they left these men behind, and it is a betrayal many will not
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I stay in the village, the Hezbollah will slaughter me,''
an SLA veteran-turned-refugee, one of 6,000 southern Lebanese who
sought safe haven in Israel, told a reporter. ``If I flee to
Beirut, they'll slaughter me in Beirut.''
</P>
<P>
   Another refugee, an officer in the SLA for 24 years who had been
compelled to escape without his family, was frightened, too _ but
not for himself. ``I can't stop thinking about what Hezbollah men
will do to our daughters and wives. They know who I am, and they're
certain to search for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The message to Israel's supporters last week was that the Jewish
state cannot be trusted to stand by those who stand by it. That is
not a good reputation to have anywhere _ especially not in a
neighborhood as dangerous as Israel's. If the Israelis were
determined to withdraw from Lebanon unilaterally, they had a moral
obligation to make sure their friends in the SLA knew what was
coming and could defend themselves _ not to scurry out pell-mell,
with barely a word of warning to the courageous Lebanese Christians
and Muslims whose steadfastness through the years had saved so many
Jewish lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli flight from Lebanon took place nearly 60 years to
the day after the desperate Allied escape from the beaches of
Dunkirk. Unlike Barak, Winston Churchill did not proclaim that
frantic retreat before the Nazis a ``happy day'' or boast of having
gotten the troops out ``without a scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wars are not won by evacuations,'' he told the Commons. ``Our
thankfulness at the escape of our Army . . . must not blind us to
the fact that what has happened . . . is a colossal military
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak is no Churchill. More is the pity for Israel.

CONVERSION TO THE DOLLAR DIVIDES ECUADORANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ Mauro Vallejo fumbled with his socks and pulled
out two thick, wrinkled wads of sucres, his country's currency.
Then, he reached into his shirt pocket and quickly produced a thin
roll of crisp US dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dollars are easier to handle,'' said Vallejo, a 24-year-old
currency vendor, who did brisk business selling greenbacks to
passing motorists despite a steady drizzle. ``I don't have to keep
every pocket full of sucres anymore. But I feel a little lighter,
and a little poorer.''
</P>
<P>
   This small Andean country is in the midst of a radical, closely
watched experiment _ converting its currency to dollars. The move
has many of its 12 million citizens filled with hope, nostalgia,
dread, and doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to stabilize an economy that has been battered by
60 percent inflation and triple-digit devaluation over two years,
Ecuador has officially adopted the dollar as its main currency.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argue that making the dollar king will help rein in
inflation and will attract badly needed private investment to the
country, which is living through its worst economic crisis in more
than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including many of the country's vocal and restless
indigenous groups, argue that the dollar plan is a loss of national
identity, an empty promise of better economic times, an open door
for more drug-related money-laundering, and a cover-up for years of
corrupt political behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not about our currency,'' said Josefina
Andrade, a 31-year-old who sells indigenous crafts in El Ejido Park
in central Quito, the capital. ``It's about politicians and their
friends in the banks who have betrayed our people.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 9, the president at the time, Jamil Mahuad, announced
the decision to convert to a dollar-based economy. The idea it drew
thousands of angry indigenous residents to the capital.
</P>
<P>
   With encouragement from military leaders, the protesters stormed
the congressional and presidential palaces on Jan. 21, forcing
Mahuad to flee. Under pressure from US officials, who pleaded for
peace on Ecuadoran TV, military officials backed down and supported
Vice President Gustavo Noboa, another proponent of the dollar plan,
to replace Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
   The government's conversion plan fixed the exchange rate at
25,000 sucres to $1, eroding wages for most workers. As part of the
six-month dollar-transition program, however, Noboa is expected to
raise salaries for police, teachers and government workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the new president will also lift subsidies on gas,
electricity and other basic products within the next two weeks,
leaving residents bracing for higher prices and more social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tension is everywhere, and we're all waiting for what the
government will do this time,'' said the leader of one indigenous
religous group who identified himself as Jose Carlos. ``There is
still the chance that the protests will return, only next time it
might be bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador was the latest and most dramatic example of a Latin
American country turning to the dollar for economic prosperity. In
1903, Panama replaced its paper Balboas with dollars, and reminted
its coins with US denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina kept its currency, the peso, but fixed the exchange
rate at 1 to $1 in 1991 to stem inflation and devaluation. Three
years later, Cuba adopted the US dollar as the only currency that
tourists could spend, while residents continued to use Cuban pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries in the region, particularly in Central America,
have debated taking similar measures, but have refused, mostly out
of nationalism and concerns about losing control over their
monetary policy. Many of them are watching Ecuador's experience.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the currency change in Ecuador said the conversion
would not be traumatic for the country. As of last year, 60 percent
of the country's bank accounts took place in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many residents said they cried in March as heaps of
50,000 sucre bills, all of them bearing the goateed image of the
national hero, Eloy Alfaro, leader of a revolution in 1895, were
dumped into a shredder at the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   To acquire the greenbacks, the government has been cashing in
part of its reserves and international investments and flying in
bundles of dollars under heavy security. Merchants have also begun
posting prices and accepting payments in both currencies.
</P>
<P>
   But there doesn't seem to be enough new money available yet _ at
least not in small bills. The question heard most often on Quito's
streets these days is, ``Can you make change?''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who endorse the measure warn that dollarization is
not a panacea, and that conversion won't work unless the Ecuadoran
government follows through on its pledges to privatize stagnant,
state-owned industries like telephones, petroleum and electricity
and attract revenues to pay off it's swollen $15 billion foreign
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said that Ecuador's banks, notorious for making
bad loans to well-connected political and business figures, must be
overhauled and regulated. Some have warned that a loosely regulated
banking sector in a dollar-based economy could lead to more
money-laundering in a country nestled in the Andean drug region.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts believe that that the new currency should have
come after government and business reforms, not before them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecuador needs to change its political culture and institutions
as a prerequisite to dollarization,'' said Jerry Haar, a Latin
America economics expert at the North-South Center at the
University of Miami. ``To do otherwise puts at risk not only a
dollarized monetary system but the very social, political and
economic foundation of the nation.''

THE ACLU AND THE G-WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union has a well-deserved
reputation as a scourge of religion in the public square.
</P>
<P>
   When a judge in Alabama displayed the Ten Commandments in his
courtroom, the ACLU filed suit to force their removal. When a
church in Troy, Mich., put a banner promoting the National Day of
Prayer on the lawn of the civic center, the ACLU demanded that it
be taken down. When the Sycamore School District in southern Ohio,
anticipating a high number of absences, decided to cancel classes
on Yom Kippur, the ACLU went to court to keep the schools open.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU has fought to stop town plows from clearing snow in
church parking lots, to prevent Mothers Against Drunk Driving from
putting up white crosses at the sites of fatal drunk-driving
accidents, and, of course, to shoot down anything that smacks of
organized prayer on public school grounds. But it is hard to see
how the ACLU can possibly top its latest campaign: an assault on
the motto of the State of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, the Ohio Legislature adopted ``With God All Things Are
Possible'' as the Buckeye State's official motto. In 1996,
then-Governor George Voinovich proposed that the motto be engraved
in granite on a plaza at the Ohio Statehouse. Whereupon the ACLU
swung into action, arguing that the motto violates the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and didn't belong on
the statehouse plaza _ or on anything else owned or created by the
state of Ohio. A federal judge ruled for the state, but on April 25
a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Because the words of the motto are a quotation from the New
Testament _ they are spoken by Jesus in the Book of Matthew _ the
judges found that they amount to ``an endorsement of the Christian
religion by the State of Ohio.'' Indeed, they express ``a uniquely
Christian thought not shared by Jews and Moslems.'' As a result,
the state has ``effectively said to all who hear or see the words
`With God All Things Are Possible,' that Christianity is a
preferred religion to the people of Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the ACLU was thrilled. ``We are delighted with the
ruling,'' said the director of the Ohio chapter, Christine Link. It
``affirms the bedrock principal that the state cannot and should
not choose between competing religious doctrines.''
</P>
<P>
   But is that what ``With God All Things Are Possible'' really
does? Could any sentiment be less particularistic? If Ohio's motto
amounts to ``a uniquely Christian thought'' merely because the
words are taken from the New Testament, then the motto that appears
on all American coins and currency _ ``In God We Trust'' _ must be
a uniquely Jewish thought, since it is adapted from the Hebrew
Bible (``In God I trust; I am not afraid'' _ Psalms 56:11).
</P>
<P>
   No, no, say the judges; the God on the money is OK; it's only
the other God, the God of Ohio's motto _ the one who frowns on
money _ who doesn't pass constitutional muster. You think I am
twisting the court's words? Listen:
</P>
<P>
   ``The god of the coin of the realm'' _ this is from Judge
Merritt's concurring opinion, in which Judge Cohn joined _ ``is not
by any means the God of Matthew 19:21-26, who makes all things
possible, a God who disapproves of mammon, and who through his son,
Jesus Christ, reportedly threw the money changers out of the
temple.''
</P>
<P>
   This is theological hooey. When Jesus said, ``With God all
things are possible,'' he was echoing the words spoken by Job
centuries earlier (``Then Job answered the Lord and said: I know
that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be
hindered'' _ Job 42: 1-2) and foreshadowing those of Mohammed
centuries later (``Know you not that God is able to do all
things?'' _ Koran, Sura 2:106) If the Court of Appeals and the ACLU
truly imagine that the ominpotence of God is ``a uniquely Christian
thought not shared by Jews and Moslems,'' they are badly out of
touch with the beliefs of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's attorney general, Betty Montgomery, has appealed the
three-judge panel's ruling to the full Sixth Circuit. If necessary,
she can also appeal to the US Supreme Court _ where, she pointedly
notes, every session begins with the invocation, ``God save the
United States and this honorable court.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment is not an invitation to strip every hint of
religious faith from the public sphere. If Ohio's motto is not
allowed to stand, then the words ``under God'' must be deleted from
the Pledge of Allegiance. Presidents must stop taking the oath of
office on a Bible. Congress must end the practice _ which goes
straight back to the Founders _ of beginning each day's session
with prayers led by an official chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   The G-word may offend the ACLU, but there are other views worth
considering. This one, for instance:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have staked the future of all of our political institutions
. . . upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves,
to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten
Commandments of God.''
</P>
<P>
   So wrote James Madison, the author of the First Amendment.

MEETING THE URBAN CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Urban gardening is always a challenge, thanks
to pollution, tiny lots, and the unyielding shade of surrounding
buildings. But this Sunday, 35 yards here that successfully solve
these problems will be open on a first-time tour to benefit
programs of the Friends of the Cambridge Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   The garden on the tour that I was most curious to visit belongs
to Carol Johnson, the first American woman to head a large
landscape architecture firm and to receive the American Society of
Landscape Architects' ASLA Medal, the field's most prestigious
award.
</P>
<P>
   From the State House to the Lechmere Canal Park, Bostonians are
surrounded by the work of Carol R. Johnson Associates Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Rangy and athletic, Johnson is a quietly intense and firmly
focused woman, attuned to the outdoors. When she was designing the
John Fitzgerald Kennedy Memorial Park next to the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard, she got the idea for a fountain of water
running over and enlivening the text of JFK's speeches while hiking
in New Hampshire and watching streams coursing over rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The signatures of Johnson's design style include use of
different levels, the massing of plants, and sensitivity to fitting
in with the existing neighborhood. These themes can be found in her
own small Cambridge garden.
</P>
<P>
   But the big surprise is that she has created a wonderful outdoor
space for herself without having any backyard. She has been so
successful at this, in fact, that you can be there a long time
before you notice that her house is right up against the rear
property line, almost in the neighbor's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   When she bought the 1928 Colonial two decades ago, it sat on
berms that disconnected it from a front yard overgrown with trees
and shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   She gave it a hard look and decided, ``I wanted sunshine and an
experience of different levels, and I wanted to relate the garden
to the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Subtle solutions
</P>
<P>
   Her solutions were low-key, subtle, and brilliant. First, she
boldly cut down the trees and put in a vegetable garden.
</P>
<P>
   Then she built a garage in front of the house to one side, so
the land behind it became a substitute backyard. Though it's really
a side yard, the brick garage, which coordinates with a brick
addition on the house next door, transformed it into a private
enclosure for outdoor dining. Grapevines growing on a tall pergola
over a picnic table provide an outdoor ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's most radical move was extending the berm out from
the house almost to the front sidewalk, essentially elevating the
entire front yard to 4 1/2 feet above street level. This created a
40- by 45-foot ``forecourt'' to the house with a nice lawn edged
with perennial plantings.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you get up to the house now? Johnson moved the
street-level entrance walk to the far side of the lot. You enter
through a gate and follow a walk alongside the base of the berm,
which allows you to admire the May apples and other shade-tolerant
wildflowers enjoying the perfect drainage of their little hillside
site.
</P>
<P>
   Then you climb steps up to the raised forecourt and find
yourself emerging into sunlight. You have also entered a zone of
relative privacy. Even though you are standing in a front yard, its
elevation largely shields you from passersby.
</P>
<P>
   More steps take you to the roof of the garage, which provides a
third level. ``It's a great joy,'' she says of the
furnished-garage-rooftop aerie, ``because I can see down the
street. I sit here and read, and I love looking down at the
gardens. And it's pleasant for guests who gather for drinks before
we eat down below (behind the garage), because the variety of
levels provides different experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is a discreet landscape that fits in with the
neighborhood. A picket fence along the street, carefully selected
to coordinate with the neighbors' fences, helps to disguise the
unconventionality of the design.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, Johnson grows a lot of food here. She cultivates
``big green leafy things that don't need much sun _ chard, arugula,
rhubarb'' in the vegetable plot, which is encircled by a boxwood
hedge that is not tightly uniform, but casual and lumpy.
</P>
<P>
   The grape arbor yields green grapes for pies. Dwarf fruit trees
in the forecourt produce Bartlet and Asian pears, peaches and
plums. But not for Johnson. Neighborhood raccoons plunder the
produce. ``I'm willing to share. But they're not,'' she complained.
Other wildlife attracted to her Eden includes industrious urban
skunks who have found her small lawn a happy hunting ground for
grubs.
</P>
<P>
   After the spring bulbs and perennials have finished, Johnson
depends on strategically placed urns of impatiens _ the best annual
flower for shade _ to carry color through the summer.
Container-grown plants require daily watering, which is a bother,
so Johnson has hooked each urn to an automatic drip irrigation
system. The little lawn also has an irrigation system, with pop-up
heads ``I'm constantly digging up and breaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson would consider her yard a low-maintenance garden _ if
she believed such a thing existed. But working in her yard is one
of her great pleasures and her problem is lack of time, not desire.
``I spend as much time in it as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   No detail too small
</P>
<P>
   Whether designing a major project or her own garden, Johnson
believes she needs ``to have a large vision with an understanding
of detail. There's no detail too small to contribute to the final
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Many are the details Johnson takes quiet delight in. She points
out the low wall that runs along the top of the forecourt berm like
a crown. ``It's Flemish bond . . . That's a way of laying the brick
to have cross-shaped openings.'' Little mirrors have been set into
these openings along the garage. You'd never notice them now
because they are covered by climbing hydrangea. ``But in the winter
I see it as I'm walking down the street and it makes the garden
look like it goes on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson clearly built this landscape for her own enjoyment, not
to impress others. Its sophisticated use of space contrasts
appealingly with its lack of pretension.
</P>
<P>
   A little ornamental pool by the door used to have a fountain
figure of a toad spitting water, which she cajoled from the late
Jorge Epstein, the prickly salvage king of Blue Hill Avenue. It
finally disintegrated, so she bought a lion's head to replace it
and drilled a hole through its mouth herself. ``But I broke the
lion's tongue. I'm afraid he's going to be spitting water
sideways.'' And where did she get this garden sculpture? She
shrugged. ``It was just one of those concrete things you buy on the
side of the highway.''
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Gardens of Cambridge, An Open Gardens Day this
Sunday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., is sponsored by the five-year-old
Friends of the Cambridge Public Library. It will feature gardens
clustered in four neighborhoods _ Central Cambridge, Huron Avenue,
Brattle Street, and Coolidge Hill _ that allow for parking and
walking. The Cambridge Historical Society will serve lemonade at
the Hooper-Lee-Nichols house, 158 Brattle St. The Boudreau Library,
245 Concord Ave., a block past Huron Avenue, will be selling $20
tickets with a handsomely produced booklet of maps and garden
descriptions the day of the event. Cambridge libraries are selling
tickets in advance. Call 349-4032 for more information.

<P>
   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. _ Built by a descendant of a Salem witch trial
victim, passed down from family to family to a wealthy bachelor's
housekeeper, and then abandoned in old age, the once-proud Major
Lawson Nurse house faced its own, 20th-century trial several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence? Demolition. It was time for developers to convert
the 46 acres of farmland into house lots. Time to tear down the
late-18th-century Nurse house that sat silently at the property's
edge.
</P>
<P>
   But word of the house's impending doom got townsfolk talking,
especially those interested in preserving New England's
architectural past.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Welles, a self-described ``sucker for old homes,'' was one
of them. Head of the city's historic district commission, landscape
gardener, and mother of two, Welles had driven by the Nurse house
for years. Since it was half-hidden behind a stone wall, she knew
it only as a late-night gathering spot for teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge
</P>
<P>
   ``It hadn't been lived in for a decade and a half,'' says
Welles, in the renovated kitchen of the Nurse house on Badger
Street. ``The windows were all broken, and the house had been
picked clean except for a few jelly jars. But it had good bones.
And I loved the way the land undulated down to the water.''
</P>
<P>
   She also loved the large, caved-in barn that dominated the
property. But was it salvageable? Yes, said Chris Walsh, an
architect known around town for his interest in historic homes and
an enthusiastic comrade in Welles's rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knew some sucker would eventually come along and
buy the place,'' says Welles, smiling at Walsh as she serves him a
cup of coffee. ``I was that sucker.''
</P>
<P>
   She'd done cosmetic work on two previous homes but had never
needed a contractor, let alone a contractor who understood
post-and-beam construction. Getting the proper permits was another
hurdle. But after several starts and stops, Welles and her husband
(they have since divorced) were ready to put out bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hold my breath as various contractors walked around and
talked about fixing the old slanting floors and drilling holes in
the chestnut beams for electrical wiring,'' says Welles. ``They
were used to new construction, not an antique with dead possums in
the basement that didn't fit modern building codes.''
</P>
<P>
   And dealing with ghosts was certainly not included in the
contract. Welles tells of stopping by the house one afternoon and
finding the carpenters as ``white as sheets.'' They'd been
hammering away when a couple mysteriously appeared in the driveway
dressed in Colonial garb. They were further unnerved when the
couple asked if Welles was around. Then they disappeared as quickly
as they had come. Welles had to assure the shaken carpenters that
the couple were just friends dressed for a historical society event
_ not former owners returning to haunt workmen driving nails into
their old home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this whole thing on a shoestring,'' says Welles, who
credits the success of the three-year project to dedicated workmen
and the passionate and creative input of Walsh. ``To make it work
financially, we had to sell our other house.''
</P>
<P>
   Which meant making the front part of the old house livable for
Welles, her husband, and their two young sons. But first they
cleaned out the barn, tied its corners, and replaced the roof so it
could hold their furniture and all building materials. Then they
started on the house, clearing several raccoon families from the
four, south-facing rooms _ the library, parlor, and two bedrooms
above.
</P>
<P>
   However, to obtain an occupany permit they needed electricity, a
toilet, a sink, and a bathtub. They poured a cement floor in the
basement, and this became the family's ``kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing Robinson Crusoe soon lost its luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys thought it was fun for about two weeks,'' says
Welles. ``Thank heavens it was summer, because there was no
homework involved and we didn't need heat. But it was dirty down in
that kitchen _ whenever anyone walked overhead or pounded a nail,
dirt filtered down through the floor and onto our pots and plastic
plates. We did a lot of barbecuing that summer.''
</P>
<P>
   A home once more
</P>
<P>
   The result of their disrupted lives _ a handsome home behind an
astonishingly beautiful stone wall _ was worth the discomfort, even
though the marriage did not survive. From the street, the house
looks very much as it must have 200 years ago, the exception being
a small attached barn on the north end that is now a two-car garage
with the master suite overhead. But what brings it into the 21st
century is that the back has been opened up with French doors in
the dining room and an elegant curved staircase encased in a
multiwindowed tower that sprays sunlight on the new open kitchen
and family room.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, we wanted to retain the front of the house
that looks over the millpond and the side that faces the street,''
says Walsh. ``The window and corner moldings in the front rooms and
the filigree detailing on the front stairs are wonderful. We
stripped the rest of the house back to the frame. From the street,
it still looks like the 1780s house.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside living spaces accommodate a very modern extended family.
The former library is now Welles's office, and the best parlor is
the living room with soft pastels of peach and lime green. The two
bedrooms above are now a bedroom, sitting room, and bath for
Welles's mother, who has recently moved in after putting her
Wellesley home on the market. A large dining room opened up from a
warren of little rooms has a series of French doors along that back
wall that leads to a patio. The large kitchen with fireplace and
family room completes the ground-floor layout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not, and I repeat, not a restoration,'' says Welles.
``In my previous house, everything was to the period _ 1863. But
this time I wanted black granite counters in the kitchen and a sexy
staircase in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys' bedrooms and bath are above the dining room and
kitchen, and the ``sexy'' staircase leads to the master suite _ a
cozy library, large walk-in closets, and bedroom with high ceiling
and balcony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we achieved what we wanted in getting the living
pattern right for this family,'' says Walsh. ``It was a challenge
to take an older house with formal rooms and bring it together with
modern spaces. The grandmother has a very private area in the
front, the boys are in the middle, and then Ann has her privacy in
the back. It's a very flexible, flowing space.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm glad we didn't lose it to developers,'' continues
Walsh. ``It's a house and a piece of land that shouldn't be lost.
It has it all _ water, historic armature, millpond, barn, house,
and fabulous stone wall.''
</P>
<P>
   That armature went up about a century after the Salem witch
trials, when people began to settle in Framingham. Major Lawson
Nurse, a shoemaker and descendant of Rebecca Nurse, one of the
victims of the witchcraft tragedy, built the house between 1780 and
1810. Unlike other homesteads of that era, it passed down through
several families during the 19th century until it was bought by
John Russell Macomber in 1925. A bachelor, financier, and animal
lover, Macomber put up a large house and stables across the river
from the Nurse house and eventually built a half-mile flat track
and steeplechase that he named Raceland, which attracted some
25,000 visitors annually. He bequeathed the land to his housekeeper
with instructions that it be given to the MSPCA upon her death. The
animal protection group inherited the estate in 1971 and turned it
into the unsuccessful Macomber Center for Humane Education. The
property was sold to developers in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Welles got interested in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I belong here,'' says Welles. ``I like waking up
and knowing that other families lived here. I can see their
footprints on the floorboards. Or I'll sit behind the barn and look
out onto the water and think `Oh, this is what it looked like 100
years ago.' ''

WHEN INCHWORM DAMAGE BEGINS TO ADD UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  Help! My trees are being eaten by cankerworms!
Exterminators said they will treat small trees, but not big ones
like mine, unless there are big bugs. Could I spray soapy water on
my trees to kill the worms? Would that hurt the trees? The worms'
droppings look like poppy seeds, and when they get wet, they are
slippery!
</P>
<P>
   ERIN McQUILLAN, Braintree, Mass. &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  We call them inchworms, from the peculiar gait they use
when walking on leaves that they devour. The gait is primitive, the
critter pushing its body forward, then bringing up the rear in a
looping motion, and continuing by extending the front of the body,
flattening out the loop. They are also called loppers. Their
appetites are huge; they can make lacework of a maple tree in a few
days, even defoliate a large tree.
</P>
<P>
   They have plagued South Shore maples for several years now; this
year does not look too bad, at least in the handyman's experience.
Perhaps the worms are near the end of their cycle, just as the
gypsy moth disappeared after devastating trees for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying the trees with soapy water will not hurt them, but can
do a job on the worms. It is too late now to do that, because they
are pretty well gone. Maybe next year. Right now is cleanup time:
Sweep and hose off the patio, decks, and sidewalks made slippery by
the droppings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  My neighbor who has a house in Florida has an interesting
gadget on the phone at his house here that lets him call home to
check if the heat is OK. Are you familiar with such a gadget? I
like the idea.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN PRICE, Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  The idea is a good one; the handyman is familiar with such
gadgets, and has the following list of providers in his file: Some
systems alert the homeowner to dropping temperature in an empty
house: no answer, temp OK; busy signal, temp too low. Other systems
work differently, usually alerting the neighbors to a dropping
temp.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are: Phone-Stat, 517-372-7426; Freeze-Warn,
203-364-9322 or 800-328-0332; and Control Products, 800-947-9098 or
612-448-2217.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  Our house was built around 1898, with cement asbestos
shingles applied later. Ivy had covered the front of the house,
much of the sides, and part of the roof and chimney. When we went
to replace the gutters, the gutter companies refused unless the ivy
is removed. We pulled down the ivy and the gutters were replaced,
but the ivy vines have left little black ``stickers'' all over the
white shingles. Is there any way to remove the stickers, short of
removing the intact shingles?
</P>
<P>
   LOUISE HADDEN &AMP; JAMES McINTOSH, Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  It would be nice to remove all the asbestos shingles, but
that has to be done professionally at great expense. To get the
stickers off, do not power-wash; this will remove them, but also
could release asbestos fibers _ something you want to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   How to do it safely: Make a strong solution of Spic and Span or
any other strong detergent such as Simple Green, and apply it to
the stickers; let it sit for several minutes; add more if it starts
to evaporate; and scrub lightly with a rough cloth. The idea is to
soften the stickers so they can be rubbed off. Another trick is to
apply a dab of Citristrip to each sticker, wait a few minutes, and
scrub off. This will soften the stickers faster than the detergent,
and is water washable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  We had a hardwood floor refinished with Fabulon, then moved
a piano on a dolly that left a big dented scratch in two rooms. The
scratch is shallow, and as wide as my finger is long. I can see it
only if I look it at it from a low angle. My husband suggested
using water to swell the fibers. Would that work? Is there any
other way to reduce that scratch?
</P>
<P>
   DEBORAH LERRA, Westford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Like the doctor who told the patient not to move ``that
way'' because it hurt, I suggest you just don't look at the scratch
from a low angle. But seriously, treating with water might work,
although the long, wide scratch is a lot of floor to treat. It also
might be difficult to get to the wood in order to swell the fibers,
and in so doing you could ruin the finish.
</P>
<P>
   I'd live with it until you sand the floors again. Perhaps you
could sand just the scratch, then patch-finish with more Fabulon,
which should patch better than polyurethane varnish. But this might
not work very well because sanding just the scratch will make the
depression wider. So, in the long run, refinishing the entire floor
in each room is the only sure cure.

PARTNERS IN FORGETFULNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some might say that my husband and I have fairly typical roles
in our marriage _ ditzy wife, take-charge husband.
</P>
<P>
   If we do, it's not a gender-based division of labor. In
relationships where one member has attention deficit disorder, the
other often takes over the task of putting structure into days that
would otherwise be rendered chaotic by a distractible, disorganized
partner _ of either sex.
</P>
<P>
   Jack's office overlooks our driveway. He checks my calendar
first thing in the morning and makes sure my car isn't home when
I'm supposed to be somewhere else. He keeps track of time for both
of us, leaves me notes reminding me of important events, and holds
on to papers too important to lose, like plane tickets and
passports. It's a typical pattern. I recently met a woman who did
all the driving because her husband was always getting lost.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've come to depend on Jack's supervision. The
last trip we took, however, he lost my passport. Luckily, a good
Samaritan found it at Logan Airport and returned it. A month ago,
he went to bed and left the flames on under soup he was making from
turkey bones. He planted six blackberry bushes without untying them
first, crowding them into two unworkable clumps. Too impatient to
wait for me, he packed my things after a weekend at my sister's
house and left behind a gift she'd given me and the $300 mouthguard
I wear at night.
</P>
<P>
   Jack is both bemused and distressed by such incidents, partially
convinced that they're a result of his having felt a bit under the
weather recently, but we're both getting older, and his lapses are
the handwriting on the wall. If he starts doing the things I always
have, I'll have to begin checking up on him.
</P>
<P>
   So far, I've been angelic. It seems only fair that I return the
kindness and tolerance Jack's always shown toward me. Still, he had
only one screw-up to oversee; if this keeps up, I'll have two of us
to keep track of, and so far it's throwing me for a loop. I may be
understanding and good-natured on the surface. Underneath I'm deep
into refusal.
</P>
<P>
   I know that because of a recent dream in which I seemed to have
assumed responsibility for flying a plane from the Middle East to
the United States. I was in a panic. I'm no pilot and the flight
was 18 hours long. The travelers, including Jack, kept milling
around, refusing to get on the plane, and as I unsuccessfully
attempted to corral them, my energy was seeping away. I couldn't
tell which was more terrifying: my uncooperative passengers or the
increasing certainty of a crash. The images were so powerful that I
woke up three times in one night, still having the same dream.
</P>
<P>
   The plane never did get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, I'm not prepared to be the one in this partnership who
makes sure our plans don't go awry. If I end up having to take
charge of details, our future is in jeopardy. I have more than
enough trouble with my own forgetfulness. How can I take on Jack's?
</P>
<P>
   I shared my feelings with my best friend, Lynn, deeply
apologetic that I even dared to present Jack's ``senior moments''
to her as a problem. For the past 15 years, Lynn's husband has had
Parkinson's disease, and as Doug has become more and more disabled,
she's had to assume responsibility for everything that goes on in
their separate and shared lives. I was afraid she'd think my fears
were trivial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't apologize,'' Lynn said. ``It's not the degree of the
problem that's important. It's making the shift in your mind.
That's taken me 10 years, and it's been hard. I didn't want to see
that Doug's abilities were failing, so as I helped him, I was
short-tempered and often angry. I blamed him as if he was
manipulating me. I wanted to run away.

   ``The new qualities that came with his illness made him
unrecognizable as the person I had loved and spent my whole life
with. I had to keep reminding myself how important it was to just
observe the changes, to be willing to meet the new person that was
emerging, and not to cling to the idea of the person he had been.
It was even harder for him to make the shift. He was no longer the

AN OLD-FASHIONED HOLLYWOOD EPIC ... FROM HUNGARY

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Ralph Fiennes
in scenes from ``Sunshine.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Hungarian director Istvan Szabo is a true legend of
international cinema, but one who remains virtually unknown to
American audiences.
 &HT;    Movies such as ``Mephisto'' (l981) and ``Colonel Redl'' (l984)
occupy spots on many savvy critics' all-time-best lists _ but they
were made in Hungarian and, therefore, available only to small
American audiences in subtitled versions.
 &HT;    That may change on June 9, however, when ``Sunshine'' opens
nationwide. It's a typically big, sweeping Szabo film, but this
time it's in English.
 &HT;    ``Sunshine'' is a novel on screen, a vast, rich,
multigenerational saga, the kind of thing that, if it were between
hard covers, would make the perfect summer read. But the story of
the Sunshine, or Sonnenschein, family is much more. It is nothing
less than a microcosm of the history of middle Europe for the last
150 years.
 &HT;    The film's co-writer, American playwright Israel Horovitz, tells
an old Hungarian joke which sums up the political background
against which the Sunshines live out their lives: An old man is
being interviewed, and he talks about the fact that he was born a
Hungarian, then became Austrian, then German, then Russian.
 &HT;    ``How lucky you are to have traveled so much,'' the interviewer
says.
 &HT;    ``I never left my village,'' the old man replies.
 &HT;    No country was buffeted by the 20th century's winds more than
Hungary, which provides the context for Szabo's fascinating tale.
 &HT;    The film opens with Ivan Sonnenschein, living in the lively,
modern Budapest of today, telling his family's story from the day
when his great-grandfather Emmanuel set out from his village to
make his fortune, clutching the recipe for the family's secret
``sunshine tonic.'' It continues through the lives of Ivan's
grandfather and father, Ignatz and Adam, and their ongoing
struggles against forbidden love and the social and political
consequences of their being Jewish.
 &HT;    To tell such a sprawling story, Szabo and Horovitz had to come
up with a unifying device. They found it in versatile British actor
Ralph Fiennes _ best known for ``Schindler's List'' (l993) and
``The English Patient'' (l996) _ who, with minimal help from the
occasional beard or mustache, plays all three leads: grandfather,
father and son.
 &HT;    ``I needed a face that could carry the whole story,'' Szabo says
by telephone from Vienna, ``and it needed to be a star. My problem,
however, was that great stars are always the same _ that's what
makes them stars. But this man needed to be able to portray three
very different men, who speak differently, behave differently, even
move differently. So he also had to be a great actor. And this was
Ralph Fiennes' talent.''
 &HT;    The story of the Sonnenscheins is also the story of Hungary's
Jews, of their assimilation and betrayal. It is a saga Szabo is
thoroughly familiar with, because it is the story of his own family
and many other Jewish families he knows in Budapest.
 &HT;    ``I was born into a family of medical doctors,'' the director
says, ``and my grandfather and my father told me that every disease
has a long history. A headache is not only a headache _ you have to
find the history behind the headache. And the story of Hungary's
Jews is different from those with other roots.''
 &HT;    American Jews consider themselves part and parcel of the mosaic
of American life, and so it was with families like the
Sonnenscheins. Thus, when Adam Sonnenschein and his new wife change
their name and convert to Catholicism, they do it with a light
heart.
 &HT;    But in doing this, Szabo demonstrates, they lose their roots and
a large chunk of their identities _ which will later come back to
haunt them.
 &HT;    ``There is a scene where they are leaving the building where
they have just changed their name, and they are laughing and
happy,'' Szabo recalls. ``My heart was sad shooting those shots, my
heart was sad editing the scene and my heart is sad every time I
see it, because I know this was the first and the greatest mistake
they made. I want to yell at them, `Why are you so happy? Are you
crazy?'
 &HT;    ``Although, of course, I know they are happy because it's my
film and I asked them to be.''
 &HT;    That mistake, the illusion that all they have to do to ensure
their success is to become indistinguishable from everyone else, is
at the heart of the film.
 &HT;    That message appealed to Horovitz when his London agent asked
him to look at Szabo's 600-page ``Sunshine'' script.
 &HT;    ``Many of my plays deal with the subject of assimilation, of
losing one's identity and trying to gain it back,'' the playwright
says, ``and of course I've always been a sucker for a family saga.
I love to see the history of the world through the eyes of one
family. It never fails to be compelling for me.
 &HT;    ``But Szabo's experience is such a fresh view,'' he adds. ``I
don't know this family until I see this film.''
 &HT;    Both men emphasize that their film is not the story of Szabo's
family or, indeed, of any particular Hungarian family.
 &HT;    ``There were several recipes and there were several families,''
Szabo says. ``Behind every character in the film there are four or
five or six different lives. Every character is a mixture of people
who told me stories, or they are stories I know personally.
 &HT;    ``There were, for example, two fencers with Jewish origins who
were members of that Olympic crew,'' he says. ``Both died during
World War II. One of them was the Olympic champion and one was a
silver medalist.''
 &HT;    To judge by the early critical response to the film, it just
might be the one which wins Szabo the American audience his work
has long deserved. The ``Sunshine'' screenplay won the Writer's
Guild of Canada Award and a similar honor from the European Film
Academy, which also named Fiennes as Best Actor.
 &HT;    Perhaps, in the end, the Sonnenscheins will turn out to be the
world's family.

COVERAGE OF NEW DRUGS IS QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine
states that mainstream media coverage of new medications ``may be
inaccurate and overly enthusiastic,'' blurred by a tendency to
exaggerate benefits and downplay risks and a failure to disclose
financial ties between experts and drug manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Given these problems, ``I think that there is a concern that the
public will have an overenthusiastic response about the benefits of
a drug,'' says study coauthor Dr. Stephen Soumerai, of the Harvard
Medical School's and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care's jointly operated
Department of Ambulatory Care and Prevention. Such reporting,
Soumerai adds, has a potential impact on such issues as drug prices
and a patient's willingness to continue taking medication that does
not produce instant results.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which featured Australian journalist Roy Moynihan as
lead author, analyzed 207 stories (180 newspaper articles and 27
television reports) about three medications: alendronate for the
treatment of osteoporosis; pravastatin, a cholesterol-lowering
drug; and aspirin, which is used to prevent cardiovascular disease.
It concluded that media coverage ``may include inadequate or
incomplete information about the benefits, risks, and costs of the
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   While more than half the stories failed to note the medications'
potential problems and 70 percent did not discuss
cost-effectiveness, the most eye-opening finding may be the
public's ignorance about the experts who are quoted in these
stories and their connections to the product. The study found that
only 39 percent of the stories that cited an expert with a
financial tie to the drug being evaluated disclosed that
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simply fails to disclose to the reader the financial ties
of investigators and experts,'' says Soumerai, adding that ``there
has been shown to be some relationships between the level of
(therapeutic) benefits reported and whether or not there was a
financial tie to the (drug) industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very big issue,'' says Tom Rosenstiel, director
of the Project for Excellence in Journalism in Washington. Citing
the explosion of health-related coverage and such disturbing trends
as TV health reports that are sponsored by health-care
organizations, Rosenstiel says the journal study connects to the
``larger problem of oversupply of health news. Rather than
informing the public, we're confusing the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the journal survey comes in the wake of published
reports that the Food and Drug Administration was critical of
favorable statements made last year by incoming journal editor Dr.
Jeffrey Drazen about a new asthma drug produced by a company that
employed him as a consultant.

   Don't count on a replacement for departed Boston Magazine editor
Craig Unger soon. According to sources, there is no short list,
long list, or in-between list of possible successors and the search
process will start from square one.
</P>
<P>
   And while Boston owner Herb Lipson can switch editors like
George Steinbrenner used to run through Yankees managers, his own
staying power will earn him a lofty honor at this month's City and
Regional Magazine Assocation (CRMA) awards. Lipson will become the
ninth recipient of the CRMA's Lifetime Achievement Award to
``recognize pioneers in the regional and city magazine business,''
says CRMA executive director Jim Dowden. (Think of it as the city
mags' Irving Thalberg Award on Oscar night). Meanwhile, while the
other winners haven't been announced, Boston Magazine reportedly is
a top-three finisher in nine different categories. You can bet
Unger will be putting that on his resume.

   Old foes bury the hatchet. April Oliver, the former CNN producer
fired after the ill-fated 1998 Operation Tailwind story alleging
that the US used nerve gas on a mission to kill defectors during
the Vietnam conflict, has settled her suit against the cable
network. Although Oliver attorney Roger Simmons had earlier tossed
out a $5 million figure, terms of the settlement _ reached late
last week _ were not disclosed. Simmons did say that ``April still
stands by her position'' that the Tailwind story was accurate,
adding that ``there's a lot of positive in this from April's
standpoint.'' (Oliver has, however, abandoned her journalism career
for law school.)
</P>
<P>
   One interesting aspect of this deal: Oliver, who in her suit
accused CNN of firing her ``to mollify the military establishment''
will now help CNN defend itself against still pending litigation
resulting from the Tailwind story.

   Starting Monday, Robert Bartley, the soft-spoken Iowan who runs
The Wall Street Journal's thunderously conservative opinion pages,
will reprise the weekly ``Thinking Things Over'' column, which
first began in 1936 under Journal editor Thomas Woodlock. While
providing a forum for Bartley's views on the issues, the column
will also be a vehicle for commenting on press performance and
explaining the Journal's editorial commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been assumed around here that eventually I'd would
write `Thinking Things Over,' '' Bartley said. Asked if this was a
transitional step toward leaving the paper, Bartley _ who has run
the editorial pages since 1972 _ read a segment of his first
column, alerting those who see the move as a ``prelude to early
retirement,'' to the fact that his 92-year-old father still mows
his own lawn.

   Ten-year-old Emerge magazine, which billed itself as an
``issues-oriented'' publication for ``upscale African-Americans,''
was shut down Wednesday, with its owner announcing plans to
relaunch early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emerge represented a hallmark in African-American
publishing,'' says Keith Clinkscales, chairman and CEO of Vanguarde
Media, which publishes the 153,000-circulation magazine. ``However,
a new editorial strategy gives us a unique opportunity to reach a
broader readership and improve our business prospects.'' Vanguarde
indicated that its decision resulted in the elimination of a number
of jobs.

&HT;     STROKE VICTIM STILL HAS FAITH IN CELL TRANSPLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Stroke patient Maribeth Cook seemed to
pass with flying colors an experimental fetal pig brain cell
transplant last September, but she grew worried after receiving
word recently that two other stroke patients in the clinical trial
suffered complications.
</P>
<P>
   A seizure and brain swelling in patients No. 4 and No. 5 in the
unproven animal-to-human cell transplant procedure caused the
biotechnology company conducting the trials to suspend them.
</P>
<P>
   That created anxious moments for Cook, 39, of Saratoga Springs,
who was patient No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was concerned that I might be in danger,'' Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
   But discussions with the coordinator of the clinical trials and
officials with Diacrin Inc., the Charlestown, Mass., biotech
company developing the procedure, called xenotransplantation,
allayed Cook's fears.
</P>
<P>
   Patient No. 4, who suffered a seizure a week after the
transplant, is a diabetic and prone to seizures, according to
Jonathan Dinsmore, Diacrin's senior director of cell
transplantation research.
</P>
<P>
   Patient No. 5 experienced brain swelling several days after the
transplant in a region of the brain that was not involved in the
procedure, Dinsmore said. Both patients had the complications
controlled by medication without serious damage, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The other three patients in the clinical trial suffered no
complications and displayed improvements in stroke deficits with
the injection of fetal pig brain cells, Dinsmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Diacrin officials temporarily suspended the clinical
trial pending a review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA is being cautious, which is fine,'' Dinsmore said.
``We're very concerned about safety, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinsmore hopes the clinical trial for stroke patients will be
allowed to resume and eventually proceed to the second phase, as
has Diacrin's studies on Parkinson's disease patients. Dinsmore
pointed to Cook's successful transplant as evidence of its safety
and efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maribeth is doing very well, a model patient,'' said Loretta
Barron, study coordinator for Cook's clinical trial at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center in the Boston suburb of Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   Barron said Cook has passed batteries of tests in periodic
follow-up visits with her neurologist, Dr. Louis Caplan.
</P>
<P>
   Although magnetic resonance images, or MRIs, have failed to
detect visible new growth and regeneration where 30 million fetal
pig brain cells were injected with a long needle deep into the
stroke-damaged part of Cook's brain, strides have been made during
Cook's thrice weekly therapy sessions in Saratoga Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said she continues to enjoy improvements in the function of
her damaged left side, which was partially paralyzed in a 1994
stroke. She has better range of motion and less rigidity in her
left arm and hand, has been fitted with a smaller and lighter brace
for her left foot and can concentrate better on printed material.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newest improvement is that I'm able to read books again,''
Cook said. ``After the stroke, it was frustrating because I read
the same page over and over again and never finished a book because
I couldn't concentrate long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   She also has been walking more briskly, more often and at
greater distances.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, nine months after the cell transplant procedure, Cook
is scheduled to have another routine checkup in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Even if, as on past visits, an MRI does not indicate new cell
growth in Cook's stroke-damaged brain, Dinsmore said that is not
reason for discouragement.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of fetal pig brain cells a patient gets requires a
delicate balance. Too few cells and the improvements are likely to
be less dramatic and not picked up by an MRI. Too many cells and
there is a risk of overgrowth, like soda foam overflowing a glass,
increasing pressure on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   At 30 million cells, Dinsmore said, optimal growth would have
filled in perhaps 10 percent of Cook's burned-out section of the
brain damaged by her stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect the MRI to pick up cells filling in the hole,''
Dinsmore said. ``There's nothing the MRI is telling us that
reflects on whether the graft is surviving or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinsmore said one dosage option under review is to give stroke
patients five times the amount of cells Cook received, or 150
million fetal pig brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if the FDA allows the clinical trials to resume,
additional stroke patients await the transplant procedure. Nobody
has pulled out as a result of the suspension, Dinsmore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complications didn't diminish interest,'' Dinsmore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Complications can happen with any surgery,'' Barron said.
``There's no clear reason why either patient had complications. A
suspension isn't unusual with a new study like this. I wouldn't be
surprised if the study is continued fairly soon.''

FROM BOYS TO MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does your 11-year-old son worry he'll never be popular because
he's too thin or too short? Have you found your 13-year-old poring
over a bodybuilding magazine at the grocery store? Has your
14-year-old decided to shave even though you could count the number
of hairs on his chin?
</P>
<P>
   Paying attention to his body's changes, worrying about his
appearance, being pleased he's arrived at masculinity (``Those chin
hairs are sacred!'' says psychologist Michael Thompson) _ these are
rites of passage that are as normal and healthy for boys as similar
ones are for girls.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, we expect and anticipate this kind of focus on the
physical from our daughters. With sons, it takes us by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do boys care how they look, researchers say, but they
are just as likely as girls to develop an unrealistic body image
that puts them at risk for several disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The two most widely known eating disorders, anorexia nervosa and
bulimia, are typically associated with adolescent girls. In the
past 10 years, however, more than a million males have been
diagnosed. Disorders that more typically affect boys are ones that
most of us have never heard of: muscle dysmorphia (thinking your
muscles aren't big enough); body dysmorphic disorder, or
dissatisfaction with a body part; and the Adonis complex, a phrase
being made popular by a book of the same name that describes boys
and men who model their bodies on beefed-up images pushed on them
by the culture.
</P>
<P>
   A boy's journey to masculinity begins in the preschool years
when he first forms ideas of what it means to be a man: Is a man
gentle or harsh? Does he change diapers or only tires?
</P>
<P>
   ``The more present a father is, the more a son will model his
image after him,'' says Thompson, a school consultant and co-author
of the best-selling book ``Raising Cain'' (Ballantine). No matter
how involved a father is, however, cultural influences play a
bigger and bigger role as a son grows.
</P>
<P>
   Idealized images
</P>
<P>
   Boys in every generation have had idealized images of maleness
to emulate. Think John Wayne and Johnny Weissmuller. Our sons have
the distinction of being the first boys to grow up being told that
16 1/2-inch biceps aren't big enough, that pecs and delts have to
bulge, that only a six-pack of abdominals will do. Think GI Joe and
WWF.
</P>
<P>
   When GI Joe first appeared in 1964, he had a body an ordinary
boy could aspire to. Today, Joe is so muscular that it would be
hard for any boy to look like him without steroids, says researcher
and psychiatrist Harrison G. Pope Jr. of Harvard Medical School,
co-author of ``The Adonis Complex.'' Ditto the images boys see in
ads and on billboards, TV, and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Boys take these physical attributes more to heart than we
realize, says psychologist William Pollack of McLean Hospital near
Boston. ``By 8 or 9, they have a clear image of what a male body
should be: big and beefy,'' he says. Pollack is the author of the
best-selling ``Real Boys.'' His newest book is ``Real Boys'
Voices'' (both Random House).
</P>
<P>
   That means that even before his body begins to change, a boy has
a preconceived idea of what he wants it to look like. Anything less
will be disappointing and inadequate. By 14, every boy struggles
with this to some degree as he tries to establish his maleness,
says Thompson. The typical boy worries about:
</P>
<P>
   --Intimidation by other boys: ``Am I big/strong enough?''
</P>
<P>
   --Whether he's attractive to girls: ``Am I too scrawny? Too
short, too fat, too thin?''
</P>
<P>
   --Not being a man in his own eyes: ``Have I achieved my own
definition of masculinity?''
</P>
<P>
   A boy who spends 15 minutes on his hair every morning, thinks
about his clothes, and/or wants to eat healthy or work out with
weights is working on these issues in a healthy developmental way,
says psychiatrist Katharine A. Phillips of Brown University, one of
Pope's coauthors.
</P>
<P>
   But normal can inch toward problematic, partly because we don't
know what our sons are thinking. ``A boy's struggle is most likely
to be entirely internal _ a secret,'' says Pollack. If he does talk
about any aspect of his body, it's often with strong feeling: ``I
hate my hair/ears/nose!''
</P>
<P>
   We typically respond with a comment intended to reassure: ``You
always look fine!'' or ``Why are you worrying so much about the
size of your ears?'' But this tends to push him away, not draw him
near. To him, the first response is dismissive, the second,
shaming. Pollack says it's better to mirror what he said _ ``You're
having a bad hair day, huh?'' _ and acknowledge how important it is
to feel like you look good: ``I hate it when I have a bad hair day;
it makes me grumpy.''
</P>
<P>
   If he changes hairstyle or dress, notice but don't judge: ``I
see you're combing your hair differently'' rather than ``Gee, I
liked the old style. Why'd you change?'' In other words, plant a
seed that there are alternative ways to look _ ``It looks good both
ways'' _ rather than struggle over it.
</P>
<P>
   Weight training
</P>
<P>
   If a boy shows interest in weight training, don't shut him down.
Respond by saying ``Tell me why you want to do this,'' rather than
``That's stupid!'' Even if his reasons surprise you _ ``I hate my
body! I'm scrawny!'' _ be supportive: ``Let's find a trainer who
has experience with boys your age.'' Do some research to find
someone you can trust; if what your son wants to do is
inappropriate, he'll accept it more willingly from the trainer than
from you.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a teenage boy, when you give a flat no rather than `Let's
talk about it,' he feels cut off from you in the struggle,'' says
Pollack. ``So if things get serious, he won't come to you for
help.''
</P>
<P>
   What's most serious is the use of anabolic steroids, or
synthetic testosterone, to enhance musculature. Six to 7 percent of
adolescent boys use them. ``That's one in 15 boys,'' says Phillips.
``Your son probably knows someone who does. Is he susceptible? Do
you even know?''
</P>
<P>
   Because boys' steroid use is typically without medical
supervision (it's illegal without a prescription but widely
available on the black market in gyms), there is frequent abuse.
Boys rarely are aware of the potential side effects:
</P>
<P>
   --Accelerated hardening of the arteries and a higher risk for
early heart disease;
</P>
<P>
   --Severe aggression and irritability, mood swings, and
personality changes that have been linked to violent crime;
</P>
<P>
   --Short-term shrinkage of the testicles and penis;
</P>
<P>
   --Permanent stunting of the body's long bones.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips speculates that one reason there isn't more steroid use
among boys is because it can only be taken by injection. That's
about to change, however. This summer, for the first time,
synthetic testosterone will be sold in gel form, as AndroGel.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the boys who couldn't stomach giving themselves a shot
will be slapping jelly on like crazy,'' says sociologist Michael
Kimmel of the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He is
the author of ``Manhood in America'' (Free Press).
</P>
<P>
   Andostene dione, the adrenal hormone used by home-run king Mark
McGwire, can be purchased legally by any boy at a nutrition store,
says Pope. As many as 15 percent of boys do so, he says, and they
often take 10 times the recommended dose. ``Long-term dangers are
as yet unknown,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the dangerous end of the continuum is body dysmorphic
disorder, when a teen is embarrassed about a part of his body, even
though it looks normal to others. ``It can be any body part, from
thinking your nose is too big to your feet,'' says Phillips, who
specializes in BDD. Muscle dysmorphia causes a boy to be ashamed of
muscles he thinks are too small when, in fact, they're big.
</P>
<P>
   With a mild form of BDD, a boy can function normally, but when
it is severe, he might be too self-conscious and too preoccupied
for any of his usual activities. Many boys with severe BDD drop out
of activities, don't see friends, and spend hours in the bathroom
or holed up in their room.
</P>
<P>
   If this describes your son, seek professional help, says
Phillips. If you fear he's moving in this direction, ask him how
much time he spends each day worrying about his appearance. ``More
than an hour is our cutoff,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring up
</P>
<P>
   What worries Pope is not so much that some boys use steroids but
that all boys are getting warped ideas about their body. ``When
boys feel they can't measure up, they're likely to do bad things to
their body'' and to have poor self-esteem, he says. ``Ten years
ago, only serious jocks used steroids. Now our studies show that
boys who take them do it just to look better, not for any athletic
aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   The best insurance to keep a boy from moving toward the Adonis
complex is to counteract media images when he's 4 and 5. ``Get them
giggling,'' says Kimmel. ``Get them to see it as silly: `Wouldn't
Daddy look funny if his body was like that!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ultimate message to send, says Pollack, is this:
``Size and body have nothing to do with masculinity. You're a real
boy or a real man whatever size you are.''
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ In most families, life is so hectic and noisy
that children lack experience spending time alone and are
uncomfortable doing so. Sit together for 10 minutes and listen to
the sounds of silence, then talk about what you heard and what the
silence felt like. From ``365 Ways to Raise Great Kids,'' by Sheila

MACLAINE'S SPIRITED NEW OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've read any of Shirley MacLaine's previous eight
best-selling books it will probably not surprise you to learn that
in one of her previous lives she was a mistress of the emperor
Charlemagne. Nor will you be stunned to discover that in her
current form she was romantically involved with Charlemagne's
reincarnation, Olaf Palme, the Swedish prime minister who was
assassinated in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing, no? But pretty much everything about her new book,
``The Camino: A Journey of the Spirit'' is amazing, perhaps
especially the fact that it will be number four on the June 4 New
York Times nonfiction bestseller list. It is engaging, though, in a
way, from the first chapter, where an encounter with a wild-eyed,
barefoot lecher inspires a fervent oath (``I vowed never to be
afraid of going braless again'') to the last, when our heroine
muses, ``Does the role of extraterrestrial input enter into our
evalution of who we are as humans?''
</P>
<P>
   In MacLaine's case, I would say the answer is yes, definitely.
She's endearingly dotty, like a crackpot aunt who pops in from time
to time to tell you about her latest weird enthusiasms. She babbles
on wildly, but she's so earnest, and so unintentionally comic, that
you can't help listening even though you know most of what she says
is utterly preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Camino'' finds her walking the ancient 500-mile pilgrims'
route across northern Spain to the church of Santiago de
Compostela, said to house the relics of St. James the Apostle. It
seems an odd choice of adventures for MacLaine who, as she writes,
has never been religious, preferring instead to ``seek
spirituality.'' But, as she explains, the Camino has been a source
of ``energy'' since ancient times, running as it does along one of
the earth's ley-lines, ``the essential structure of the earth's
etheric spirit.'' If there's etheric spirit floating around, you
can be sure MacLaine will be in the middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   MacLaine undertook the difficult trek at age 60. She walked at
least 20 miles a day, often alone and in bad weather. She slept in
filthy, rat-infested pilgrims' hostels, fended off a persistent
admirer, became lost more than once, braved vicious dogs, and tried
to elude the news media. On several occasions paparazzi accosted
her in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all she was protected by two spiritual guides, a
vanilla-scented angel named Ariel, and a 12th-century monk, John
the Scot, an expert in karma and mangoes (``When digested properly,
it stimulates the correct patterns for the projection of
telepathy'') who addressed MacLaine as ``lassie.''
</P>
<P>
   As she walked the Camino in her current life, these two entities
helped her reexperience two of her past lives. In one, she was a
Moorish-Jewish-Christian healer who ``became friendly'' with
Charlemagne and ``spent many hours with him on animal skins in
front of a massive fireplace,'' and bore him three children.
</P>
<P>
   In another incarnation she was an androgynous Lemurian in an
Eden-like Atlantis who underwent sexual division and then lived
happily with the separated half as man and wife until
extraterrestrial input created an imbalance in the collective
consciousness that resulted in a natural disaster that caused
Atlantis to disappear beneath the ocean. Or something like that.
The Atlantis chapters are confusing. However, I got the impression
that MacLaine was drawing a parallel between Lemuria and
present-day America.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person's most profound insights are often regarded as
socially unacceptable and even delusional,'' she writes, near the
end of the book. Now who would that person be? I wonder.

COURT RULES AGAINST POLITICAL ASYLUM HEARING FOR ELIAN GONZALEZ

 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal court in Atlanta announced Thursday morning that it
would not force the U.S. government to grant Elian Gonzalez an
asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited ruling by a three-judge panel came as a major
victory for the 6-year-old boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who
has insisted on bringing Elian back to Cuba against the wishes of
his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But the judges said that Elian could not leave the country for
two weeks to allow his Miami relatives sufficient time to appeal
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-page written decision by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals came after three weeks of deliberation by Judges J.L.
Edmondson, Joel A. Dubin and Charles R. Wilson. In issuing their
decision, the judges said they were not ruling on whether a boy
should stay with his father but examining ``the separation of
powers under our constitutional system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the judges were determining whether the executive
branch of the government _ as represented by the Justice Department
and the Immigration and Naturalization Service _ had the right to
openly interpret legislation that allowed ``any alien'' to apply
for an asylum hearing. And they were looking at whether
intervention by the judicial branch _ as represented by the Atlanta
court _ was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   After the judges weighed whether Elian's Miami relatives could
file an asylum application against the wishes of his father, they
supported the INS' position that the father should speak for his
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important legal question in this case, therefore, is not
whether the plaintiff may apply for asylum; that a 6-year-old is
eligible to apply for asylum is clear,'' the court said in its
decision. ``The ultimate inquiry, instead, is whether a 6-year-old
has applied for asylum within the meaning of the statute when he,
or a non-parental relative on his behalf, signs and submits a
purported application against the express wishes of the parent.''
</P>
<P>
   The court said that in refusing to look at the boy's asylum
claim several months ago, the INS had adequately considered whether
Juan Miguel Gonzalez was being unfairly coerced by the Cuban
government. The judges also acknowledged that if Elian returns to
Cuba ``he will be without the degree of liberty that people enjoy
in the United States'' and that ``re-education, communist
indoctrination and political manipulation of plaintiff for
propaganda purposes'' are ``not beyond the realm of possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless, we cannot say that the INS' assessment of
plaintiff's asylum claim _ that it probably lacked merit _ was
arbitrary,'' the judges said.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that successful asylum seekers must prove to
the INS that they have been persecuted or that they have a
``well-founded fear'' of persecution if they are returned to their
homeland. The INS had made a preliminary determination that there
is no evidence that Elian would meet those standards, the judges
said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials seemed satisfied with the Atlanta court's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the circumstances, I think that justice has been done,''
Attorney General Janet Reno said at a news conference in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   She stressed that there had been no legal precedent for this
case. ``As the court said, I think our decision was reasoned and
reasonable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was in Berlin on his last official visit
to Europe, also said that he was ``pleased'' with the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the home of the relatives in Miami's Little Havana
neighborhood, where Elian lived for nearly five months, more than
100 protesters who want the boy to stay in this country waved signs
and angrily chanted slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the relatives, said at a Miami news
conference that the Atlanta court acknowledged that the INS had ``a
whole lot of room'' in its discretion to grant or refuse asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a stand-up-and-applause day for the INS,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey said the relatives had made no decision at this time
about whether to seek a new hearing. They were considering whether
to take their appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe the legal system may allow this child to have
his day in court'' before Elian is returned to Cuba, Coffey said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   News agencies reported that lawyers for the relatives have
approached Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, asking him to
grant a stay preventing Elian from leaving the United States until
the Supreme Court can consider a formal appeal. There was no
immediate response from Kennedy, who supervises emergency cases
from the appeals court in Atlanta. But he can act on the request
himself or refer it to the full Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the relatives have 45 days to ask all 12 judges on
the Atlanta court to hear the case. If the court denies that
request, the lawyers have 90 days to appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   At the Miami news conference, Elian's cousin, Marisleysis
Gonzalez, complained that her efforts to talk to the boy by
telephone had been rebuffed. She charged that the boy's father and
Cuban officials were afraid to let Elian meet his Miami relatives
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should allow us to see the boy,'' she said. ``I
think they should give us the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, lawyers representing both sides of Elian's family
distilled five months of an international struggle to an hour and a
half of legal arguments before the judges. The struggle has
embroiled the governments of Cuba and the United States, thousands
of Cuban-Americans and a family bitterly divided by politics.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, the INS returned Elian's asylum application
to his Miami relatives without reading it, saying that only the
boy's father could speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 11, lawyers for the Miami relatives pointed out
repeatedly that immigration laws do not set a minimum age for an
asylum applicant. They also argued that the Cuban government would
persecute Elian because the boy's mother had fled from the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregory Craig, the lawyer for Juan Miguel Gonzalez, said
that the ongoing custody battle was taking a heavy toll on Elian's
family and that the boy's asylum application could not be taken
seriously because a 6-year-old is too young to hold informed
political beliefs. Many child psychologists have agreed on that
point.
</P>
<P>
   The judges had pointed questions that ranged from asking the
lawyers for the Miami relatives whether Elian really understands
the meaning of his asylum application to grilling Craig on whether
Cuba's communist government might compromise the parental abilities
of the boy's father.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, and his daughter,
Marisleysis, have been among the most vocal opponents of returning
the boy to Cuba. Like thousands of Cuban-Americans in this country,
Elian's Miami relatives do not want to see the boy living in a
communist country headed by President Fidel Castro. The relatives
have been supported at every turn by demonstrators waving Cuban and
U.S. flags and placards with slogans like ``Let Elian Have His Day
in Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian is staying at the Rosedale Estate in the upscale Cleveland
Park neighborhood of Washington, D.C., with his father and his
father's wife, their 6-month-old son and several schoolmates and a
teacher from Cuba. The group moved there more than a week ago from
the 1,100-acre Wye River conference center in Maryland so they
could be closer to Craig. Before the Cuban entourage moved in, the
grounds of the lush Rosedale Estate were used in part as the
neighborhood dog run.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his father were re-united on April 22 after Reno
ordered a pre-dawn raid in which federal agents brandished
automatic rifles in front of the boy and his Miami relatives. Elian
was flown to Washington and placed in the care of his father, who
had arrived from Cuba on April 6 to claim his son.
</P>
<P>
   The two had been separated since last November, when Elian's
mother, Elisabet Brotons, took him on an ill-fated attempt to reach
the United States on a smuggling boat. When the vessel capsized,
Brotons and 10 other Cubans drowned. But fishermen discovered Elian
clinging to an inner-tube on Nov. 25 off the Florida coast. Two
other survivors were found in another inner-tube in a Key Biscayne
marina.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was given ``parole'' status by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and placed in the custody of Lazaro
Gonzalez, in Miami. Until the raid, Lazaro Gonzalez defied
government orders to hand over the boy, hoping to stall federal
officials until the Atlanta court could decide on the asylum
hearing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. _ A rumbling noise is coming from 85 New
Lexington Road.
</P>
<P>
   It's a misty Saturday morning in this neighborhood of closely
mowed lawns and small, tidy homes. Birds chirp. Children ride their
bikes. Number 85, the yellow house on the corner, spits out the
sound of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, in a basement lined with wires, 24 home computers are
lined up on tables. Twenty-four people are glued to the screens,
some wedged beside the dryer and the hot water heater. They're
playing video games with 3-D graphics and lots of blood, killing
each other onscreen in disgusting ways. In real life, they're
eating doughnuts, and they're all in a very good mood.
</P>
<P>
   It's 9:30 a.m., and the games will go on for another 18 hours;
LAN parties tend to run long.
</P>
<P>
   LAN stands for Local Area Network, a closed circuit of computers
linked together for maximum speed. A LAN party is a self-contained
video game marathon, a bring-your-own-PC event. Twenty-two people _
21 of them male _ have hauled their computers and monitors to this
little house, which belongs to players Matthew and Sarah Andrade.
The guests come from three states and range in age from 11 to 40.
They call themselves the BadLANs.
</P>
<P>
   The nominal purpose of the affair is to shoot your friends to
smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   But while the BadLANs want to know how real the blood looks when
it splatters _ and their lips curl into wicked smiles as they blow
their friends apart _ in real life, they consider themselves a
nonviolent crowd. A part of the ``gaming community.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the insider's term for the world of bloody virtual
sports, a quiet subculture of growing strength and market clout.
There are scores of Web sites devoted to reviews and news about
computer games. And while it's hard to guess how many people are
playing, some suspect that more than a million Americans go to a
LAN party once or twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   LANgoers are mostly male, mostly young, and mostly urban, said
James Mecham, director of project development at California-based
gamers.com. They are cynical, savvy, and a bit brainy. And they
find satisfaction, even exhilaration, in figuring things out
themselves _ whether it's the fact that Mountain Dew (a favored
beverage in this crowd) has more caffeine than other soft drinks,
or the way to set up a complex computer network.
</P>
<P>
   Many BadLANs players take their home computers apart once a
month, to reconfigure parts and add new features. They talk about
PCs as if they were hot rods. And they chafe at the common
complaint that violent games make a dangerous culture.
</P>
<P>
   The BadLANs say it's the opposite: Gaming gets out their
aggression in a safe and social way. It also puts their computers
to the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gaming's the only application that truly challenges a
computer,'' says Dan Ware, 25, of Somerville, Mass., who has a
tattoo on his leg and a geek's dream job: technical director of an
interactive multimedia company.
</P>
<P>
   But even Ware is sometimes trumped by Tyler Whittaker, 15, of
North Kingston, who knows more than anyone around about high-tech
developments. The rule seems to be: The younger you are, the more
time you have to fiddle, the more computer savvy you become. The
more likely you are to some day rule the world.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the BadLANs, ruling the world is not on the agenda. The
immediate goal is to win the game, whatever it happens to be.
</P>
<P>
   If the game is Quake III, the main idea is death. You're a
virtual person, whose goal is to ``frag'' _ that means kill _ other
players. You run around in a virtual world that could be a medieval
castle or an asteroid. In the foreground of your screen is your
virtual hand, which holds a virtual gun, which you shoot by
clicking your mouse. The experience can be dizzying; one player
took motion sickness medicine before he got to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's StarCraft, where the main idea is . . . death. You
control an alien race, and you try to wipe out other alien races,
by ordering your little aliens to make high-caliber weapons.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a LAN party to play these games; you can buy
copies in software stores or tap in through the Internet. But once
you've played on a LAN, regulars say, you'll be hooked. For two
reasons: ping and smack.
</P>
<P>
   Ping is the amount of time, measured in milliseconds, that it
takes for a signal to leave your keyboard, travel to the server,
and return to your screen. If you're trying to blow a fast-moving
enemy apart, ping can mean the difference between life and death.
On the Internet, ping can be anywhere from 100 to 500. Here in the
Andrades' basement, the highest ping is 12.
</P>
<P>
   Smack is the cheering and the razzing that players emit at key
moments _ after, for example, a truly epic frag. It's the
computer-game equivalent of the touchdown dance. Smack is what
makes the whole thing social. Typical smack from the BadLANs:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, in the back, Pappy? That's wrong!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not wrong. You should have looked behind you and known
I was there!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to smack, Matthew Andrade is one of the loudest.
When he yells, ``Stop moving! Stand still!'' it resonates off the
pipes. Matt, 32, is a computer operator, studying for a technology
degree. He is the technical director of the BadLANs.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Andrade, 26, studies psychology and social work. She is
the treasurer and den mother, in charge of getting pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Slesinger, 21, of North Kingston, is the Web master and
co-technical director. He works at a tool company with Matt, and
wants to start a Web design company. He wears a T-shirt that says,
``Reach out and frag someone.'' Adam is the undisputed number-one
player, and, when people frag him, they get excited.
</P>
<P>
   Matt, Sarah, and Adam have been hosting LAN parties for two
years now, ever since the day Matt brought home his first,
primitive networking equipment and announced that he was going to
try to string a few computers together.
</P>
<P>
   They crammed people into a series of small Rhode Island
apartments before Matt and Sarah bought this house in November.
When Matt saw the basement _ and calculated how many computers he
could fit there _ he fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that sad?'' Sarah says affectionately.
</P>
<P>
   This party is BadLANs XII, their biggest event ever, and with
it, they figure the house has reached its limit. Matt makes liberal
use of extension cords, but tries to plug only two computers into
each wall socket, for practical reasons. At BadLANs XI in March,
Matt and Adam tried to warm up a cup of coffee in the microwave,
and the house went dark.
</P>
<P>
   Still, demand seems to increase every month, and lately _ to
their own surprise _ the group has been getting sponsors. In
exchange for plugs and gratitude and a mention on thebadlans.net,
the group's Web site, gaming sites send free stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Such as the party's sole controlled substance: Bawls, a
super-caffeinated soft drink made from the Amazonian guarana berry.
It has three times the caffeine of a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, empty bottles of Bawls are everywhere, and
several players have consumed four to five Bawls apiece. They are
getting a little hyper. Tyler Whittaker admits that he has a slight
headache, but says he's ``not really jittery. I'm, like, extremely
awake.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to be alert to focus past the gunfire and the endless
pulsating sound of the electronic background music, to blast away
at the ``skins'' running past your virtual gun.
</P>
<P>
   A skin is a cyberbody, a player's appearance onscreen. A game
like Quake has many skin options. Some look like regular guys in
blue jeans, some like monsters. One looks like a cross between a
chicken and a giant eyeball.
</P>
<P>
   When a skin turns up on somebody else's computer screen, that
player's ``handle'' _ screen name _ shows up above it. At the same
time, running commentary appears in the upper left-hand corner of
the screen:
</P>
<P>
   ``Stryfo was machinegunned by SLaPpy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Xungan blew himself up.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Slesinger uses the handle ``breadman.'' He's not quite sure
why; could mean food, could mean money. But, he says with more than
a hint of pride, ``People have come to associate `bread' with
`fear.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There might be fear onscreen, but in the real world, relations
are convivial. Players share pointers and fix each other's
computers, and they form a neat line when pizza arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite the caffeine and the basement's rising
temperature, real-life conflicts are few. There's a yelp of protest
if someone breaks a rule, and slight outrage about the most basic
gender issue: At one point, Sarah Andrade runs down the stairs,
yelling, ``Who left the toilet seat up?''
</P>
<P>
   Even the male-female distinctions are small, says Sara Domb, 25,
of Medford, Mass. Her one complaint is that she hasn't been beating
the boys. She wants to put herself on a training regimen: an hour
of fragging practice, every day.
</P>
<P>
   Fragging may be a serious pursuit, but Dan Ware sees uses for
gaming that surpass the simple joys of death and dismemberment. The
gaming urge can drive innovations in computer technology, he says.
Eventually, nongamers may benefit, too.
</P>
<P>
   As Ware said, ``But who's to say two companies couldn't hold a
meeting in this environment?''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, without the blood.

 &HT;    AFTER 20 YEARS, SPELLING BEE'S PRONOUNCER HAS SEEN IT ALL
 &HT;    600&AMP;add. With SPELLING-BEE.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The word that comes to mind is P-A-T-I-E-N-C-E as
yet another speller asks Alex J. Cameron for a definition, and
language of origin, and alternative pronunciations, and use of the
word in a sentence, and then repeats the whole process before
launching the first letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, they have adults coaching them,'' explains
Cameron, the chairman of the English department at the University
of Dayton who on Thursday completed his 20th year as pronouncer of
the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee.
</P>
<P>
   The common strategy is for spellers to take their time at the
microphone to avoid mistakes of haste, even on easy words. So every
one seems to ask all the questions allowed in the bee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has coached them to do it, no matter what,'' said
Cameron. ``It's irritating when it's clear that they know the word
... But from (the coaches') point of view, they're protecting the
speller.''
</P>
<P>
   From its humble beginnings in grammar school classrooms, the
spelling bee has somehow become serious business. For the seventh
year, ESPN broadcast the final rounds Thursday. The show was aired
again Thursday night on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   With ESPN reruns throughout the year, Cameron marveled, ``it's
amazing how many people have seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner generally appears on several network television
programs and receives $10,000 in cash from sponsor Scripps Howard,
plus other prizes worth several thousand dollars more. And, of
course, an appearance at the national bee always provides grist for
essays on college applications.
</P>
<P>
   So contestants strive for years to become champion. Preparation
is so intense that competitors often buy a study guide that
includes a CD of Cameron calling out words so they can get
accustomed to his voice while practicing their spelling.
</P>
<P>
   The bee seemed a bit more relaxed when Cameron took over as
pronouncer at the start of the 1980s. He replaced Richard Baker,
another University of Dayton professor who had held the job for the
previous two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Cameron composed his own definitions and sentences.
But there has been an escalation in the number of contestants, and
in the number of words needed to find the best speller. So a panel
of experts now writes the definitions and sentences, while Cameron
concentrates on the nuances of enunciating the 1,000 or so words
that are readied for spelling _ or misspelling _ in the bee.
</P>
<P>
   The procession of spellers, all below the age of 16 and wearing
identical white polo shirts, can appear endless to spectators. But
Cameron has distinct memories of many competitors.
</P>
<P>
   There was one girl who didn't just cry, but absolutely wailed
after missing her word. Officials were worrying about her welfare,
Cameron recalled, when her brother, about 8 years old, looked out
from behind a curtain and said, ``Oh, she does this all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next night at the banquet, she was all smiles,'' Cameron
said. ``She was an actress, I guess. You get some theatrics.''
</P>
<P>
   A speller who misses and is eliminated is immediately escorted
off the stage and into a ``comfort room'' where tantrums and
sulking can be conducted in private.
</P>
<P>
   Among his most memorable bees were the 1980 and 1981 contests,
Cameron said. He was assisting his former colleague in 1980 when
Jacques Bailly defeated Paige Pipkin on the word ``elucubrate.''
The following year, though, Paige Pipkin came back and won on the
word ``sarcophagus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, 20 years later, the guy who came in first during Dick
Baker's last year is my assistant pronouncer and the girl whom he
beat and who came back to be my first winner is running the whole
bee,'' said Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Bailly, now the associate pronouncer, is an associate professor
of classics at the University of Vermont. The oth(after a mistake)
and convincing them that it's not as big a tragedy'' to lose.
</P>
<P>
   A noticeable change over the years is that the spellers are more
socially mature.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron remembers his predecessor describing how the kids
``played games like musical chairs,'' he said. ``They've gone from
that to holding dances.''

THE BIG DISH ON INTERNET START-UP FAILURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody loves a good failure. Oh c'mon, admit it. There is
nothing like a disaster of epic proportions to make the rest of us
feel less mundane. Nobody cares about the demise of the merely
mediocre; they're forgotten in the time it takes to shrug. But the
belly-flops of the arrogant are relished for all time. Evidence:
``Legs Diamond.'' ``Ishtar.'' ``Waterworld.''
</P>
<P>
   The nascent online entertainment business hasn't even had its
first success yet, but it's beginning to rack up a list of fabulous
flops. In recent weeks, both Pixelon and Digital Entertainment
Network (or simply, the Den) have gone belly up. And oh, what
fiascoes they were. Both ventures aimed to create a new form of
entertainment for the Internet. Pixelon described itself modestly
as an ``industry pioneer''; the Denizens fancied their efforts as
the biggest innovation since the talkies.
</P>
<P>
   Both operations were mired in scandal and mismanagement. Last
month, Pixelon founder Michael Fenne (a.k.a. David Stanley) was
exposed as a convicted swindler and fugitive. Den's cofounder, Marc
Collins-Rector, resigned last fall after he was accused of
molesting a young man. Den launched its site three times; Pixelon's
video player never worked. Den burned through $54 million in the
last year; Pixelon blew $16 million in a single night last fall
with a grandiose bash featuring a reunion of the Who.
</P>
<P>
   Pixelon's leaders seemed to think if they dazzled the world with
a big dot-com party, nobody would notice that their site crashed
every five seconds. Last fall, I told Pixelon's public relations
rep that it was impossible to watch the videos on the site, and he
responded by emphasizing the party lineup: ``We have Kiss! The
Dixie Chicks! The Who!'' Um, does anyone care that the site doesn't
work?
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the folks at Den were passionate about their
vision _ even if it turned out to be misguided. They wanted to
create interactive video programs for niche audiences, targeting
gay teens, Latino teens, Asian teens, and, yes, even Christian
teens. Each episode has a built-in e-commerce mechanism; for
instance, when a song was part of the plot, the viewer could stop
the show and buy the tune. The idea wasn't half bad. After all, the
successful sites on the Internet cater to narrow, but loyal,
followings. But Den's shows weren't any good: With titles like
``Fear of a Punk Planet'' and ``Frat Ratz,'' they were painful to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   And Den made another major miscalculation. It targeted its
programs for viewers with high-speed Internet access, predicting
that broadband would quickly become mainstream. Wrong. A recent
study by Jupiter Communications showed that only 4.5 percent of all
Internet users have high-speed Internet access; and 52 percent of
all Internet users say they aren't willing to pay more for
high-speed access. That means they're not exactly itching to watch
the latest episode of say, ``Frat Ratz,'' or any of the other
programs being offered by online entertainment companies. BarkTV,
for instance, isn't exactly drawing a huge audience, but neither is
Entertaindom.com, Warner Bros.' overhyped amusement site.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, one form of video entertainment succeeding
online. Last week, the Victoria's Secret fashion show attracted 2
million viewers. Why? It sure wasn't the intelligent commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Some day, someone is going to invent a new form of entertainment
for the Internet that doesn't rely on scantily clad models. The
folks at Dreamworks are the next in line to try; the studio's
entertainment site, Pop.com, has been in the ``Coming soon'' stage
for months and months. For now, the fabulous failures of Den and
Pixelon stand out as lessons for the future. There's even a Web
site devoted to such flops: two weeks ago, a failed entrepreneur
launched www.startupfailures.com, a site billed as ``the place for
bouncing back.''

   OK, so what have they done to Salon.com? They took away the
clean, spare list of stories and replaced it with a busy design
that looks like all the other news sites and portals online.
Frankly, I don't want to check the weather or chart my stocks or
shop while reading the latest dish (or doorknob-licking scandal) on
Salon. I don't want to listen to ``Salon radio'' while scanning
``stimulating commentary from the Web's most provocative site'' _
their words, not mine. And what's with the small type size and the
links that don't work?
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Salon underwent a redesign this week. According
to an editor's note titled ``We Feel Your Pain,'' the site has been
deluged with complaints. Editor David Talbot reminds readers that
they can still access a list of articles organized by date _ that
is, in case they don't really need to see a color glossy of Tom
Cruise over the headline, ``Missing: Intensity.'' File it under
``Missing: Simplicity.''

   Speaking of disappearing acts, somebody walked off with the
Internet's most famous phone booth. That's right, the National Park
Service and Pacific Bell have removed a lone phone booth located in
the middle of the Mojave Desert because it was, well, too popular.
The phone became an Internet sensation when a computer consultant
named Godfrey Daniels became obsessed with it and called its number
every day. He created a shrine of sorts at
www.deuceofclubs.com/moj/mojave.html. Word spread. The mystery
grew. People made pilgrimages to the remote site. They took photos.
They made calls. Apparently, they disturbed the tranquillity of the
area, so officials carted the thing away.

TALK IS CHEAP BUT NOT REAL CLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't phone my mother in Chicago often enough. So she was glad
to hear from me recently, even if I'd only called to experiment on
her.
</P>
<P>
   I was trying out Yap Jack, a $160 device from Net2Phone Inc.
that plugs into a standard telephone and lets you make Internet
phone calls without a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Yap Jack works, and it might even become a hit with expatriates
looking to make cheap phone calls to Bombay or Beijing. But for
calls to less exotic locales, Yap Jack is more trouble than it's
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Yap Jack is about the size of a modem. That figures; it is a
modem, among other things. The device dials into your Internet
provider and logs on. But it also digitizes your voice and routes
it over the Internet to any telephone number in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up the Yap Jack is the hard part. It's not easy to type
your Internet user name and password into the device, using only
the 12 keys of a push-button phone. After all, there's no ``(at)''
or ``/'' symbols on the phone keys.
</P>
<P>
   Yap Jack provides a system for getting around this, including a
British-accented female voice to offer assistance. Still, it took
me about six tries to get everything punched in correctly. People
with no Internet experience would have an even worse time of it.
For one thing, they'd have to sign up with an Internet provider
before they could use Yap Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Using Yap Jack is also a bit more complicated than making a
standard phone call. You pick up the phone, push a button on the
Yap Jack box, and press 1 on the phone keypad. Then you dial the
area code and phone number, and the pound key. And then you hang
up.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happens next: Yap Jack dials your Internet provider
and logs you in. That takes maybe 20 seconds. Then it sends an
Internet message to Net2Phone's network, telling it what number
you're calling. The message gets routed to the Net2Phone server
computer that's nearest to your call's final destination.
</P>
<P>
   That computer transforms the Internet call into a regular
telephone call, dials the number, and notifies your Yap Jack box
that everything's ready. The box starts beeping, you pick up your
phone, and there's your mom in Chicago, asking why you don't call
more often.
</P>
<P>
   The whole process takes a minute or two. Yes, it's cheaper this
way _ 2.9 cents a minute compared to, say, 7 cents for AT&AMP;T long
distance. But with Yap Jack you pay the usual penalty for Internet
calling: static, disconcerting pauses and beer-barrel acoustics. I
spent most of my chat with Mama asking her to repeat herself. She
didn't mind _ she loves talking to her baby. But I found it a bit
of a drag.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes from moving voice traffic over the public Internet.
Each data packet gets bounced six ways from Sunday through the
Internet ``cloud,'' and some arrive late or out of sequence. That
doesn't matter when you're sending e-mail, but mishandled voice
packets lead to lousy sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   There is a cure for the problem: Internet phone systems that
don't use the Internet. Major companies such as IDT Corp.,
Net2Phone's parent firm, use their own private Internet to carry
phone traffic. Use a Net2Phone calling card to place a call, and
your voice goes over this private network, never touching the
regular Internet. This time, a call to mom sounds just as good as
AT&AMP;T. But you have to dial an extra 14 digits to log onto the IDT
network, merely to save a nickel a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Internet telephone service seemed like a world-changing idea
when it cost 20 cents a minute or more to make a long-distance
call. Today, there's not much point to it for domestic users.
</P>
<P>
   But it could pay off if you place a lot of overseas calls. Yap
Jack users do all right on calls to Bombay _ 34 cents a minute
compared to AT&AMP;T's 55 cents. China costs 19 cents a minute with Yap
Jack, and less for calls to big cities. AT&AMP;T charges 32 cents to
China.
</P>
<P>
   For an hourlong chinwag with a brother in Beijing, there's
something to be said for Yap Jack. Such a caller might tolerate the
lousy sound quality, or the two-minute delay as they wait for Yap
Jack to process the call. I might become a big fan of this product,
if my mother ever moves to China. Till then, I'll stick to a
traditional long distance phone service. And I'll try to call more
often, Mama. Promise.

NEW CHRYSLER CRUISER   BRINGS REPORTS OF GOUGING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seemed a simple enough statement: ``If you run into gouging,
let me know.'' I wrote that sentence last week and slipped it deep
into a review of the hot new Chrysler PT Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   It was in there because I'd heard reports that some dealers were
jacking up the price of the Cruiser by thousands of dollars, and
since I know folks are standing in line out there looking to buy
Cruisers, it seemed like a good idea to ask the readers. Maybe we'd
catch a couple of dealers price gouging.
</P>
<P>
   Well, a funny thing happened on the way to proving a theory.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, there was a flood of e-mail that proves to me
that, no, there aren't a handful of dealers out there ``gouging''
on the price of Cruisers. It is a widespread phenomenon, with
readers reporting jacked-up prices at Chrysler dealers in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have placed orders based on the manufacturer's
suggested retail price only to find $1,000 to $3,000 added to their
bill later. Take it or leave it, because if you don't, we'll sell
the car to someone else today, some have been told.
</P>
<P>
   Others were coldly informed that everybody's doing it, so if
they want a Cruiser, they'd better be ready to pony up the dough _
often with a hefty down payment and the prospect of months of
waiting for their car to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, asked to pay $2,000 over sticker, wrote: ``When we
told the salesman we felt like we were being gouged (at a Peabody
dealership) and that we don't even like to pay sticker, he actually
said, `Well, if you're not paying at least sticker, aren't you
gouging the dealer?''' The answer to that is no, but that's a topic
for another column.
</P>
<P>
   From Plymouth came the story of a man who was told, ``I would
have to put down $1,000 and the price would be $2,500 to $3,000
over sticker.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Woburn, another man said he waited an hour before a
Cruiser salesperson could even get to him and was then told ``the
price was $3,000 over list price.''
</P>
<P>
   Many folks wrote to say they simply walked out when they felt
they were being gouged.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the rub: Several writers pointed out that even as
they walked away from deals, there were others lurking in the
showrooms ready to plunk down what the dealers were asking.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when I started to ponder my own theories on gouging.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I raised the topic _ when writing about the Honda
S2000 _ an e-mail came my way from a man asking if, in fact,
letting demand set the price for any automobile is not simply the
fair and free market at work.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't sure how I felt about that, though I knew he had a
point. It nagged at me months later when I tested the new Toyota
MR2 Spyder, like the S2000, another hot drop-top sportscar.
</P>
<P>
   And then came 10 days in the PT Cruiser, the most gawked-at car
I have ever driven. Park it and people crowd around it. Leave it
alone and unlocked and you might return to find a stranger sitting
in the driver's seat just getting the feel of the car. Demand for
it is so high that Chrysler's initial plans to sell 50,000 Cruisers
are being re-ramped to sell as many as four times that.
</P>
<P>
   So, in fact, while there is genuine and understandable outrage
among some folks over the inflated prices _ flat-out profit-taking
by dealerships _ it is customers who are driving up the price.
</P>
<P>
   And where does that leave us on the issue of ``gouging?''
</P>
<P>
   It leaves me firmly planted on both sides of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   That's because I don't think what has happened with the Honda
and Toyota hot cars is the same as what is happening with the PT
Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because both the MR2 and the S2000 were meant to be
``halo'' cars _ vehicles whose appearance in a manufacturer's fleet
adds an aura that will help dealers across the country sell more of
that manufacturer's other cars. If you can't swing the MR2 or the
S2000, for instance, at least you'll feel better about the Accord
or Celica you do buy.
</P>
<P>
   Further, both of these are cars that the manufacturers have said
flat out were meant for dealers to use _ at very reasonable prices
_ as rewards to their most loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   As in: ``Hey, Sue, you've bought three Accords here over the
years. How'd you like to get into the hottest car we make at a very
good price?''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. Honda and Toyota let their dealers know they
did not want to see price gouging on the $23,000 MR2 or the $30,000
S2000.
</P>
<P>
   The response of many dealers? Hah! Gouging on the Honda has
reached as high as $10,000 and, on the MR2, the inflated price has
approached $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   This does not make sense to me. Neither car is being produced in
great numbers. For instance, only 5,000 MR2s will be sold in the
United States this year. That means most dealers will get only a
couple of the cars to sell and some may get none.
</P>
<P>
   And those who do get them and who gouge on the price are selling
the potential for great good will for what can only be a few
thousand dollars of profit. A drop of cash, probably, in the annual
bucket of profits.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, I consider hugely inflated prices on these limited
edition vehicles to be gouging. Dealers are gouging their buyers
and, stupidly, they are gouging themselves by tainting what could
be a well of good will.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruiser, however, seems to me another matter. If, in fact,
its annual sales get into the hundreds of thousands and people are
lined up to buy them at the higher prices, then I guess that is the
free market at work _ fairly. Chrysler is not telling dealers to
back off. Buyers are telling dealers they'll pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   Across a broad range of demographics Americans are saying a fair
price is, indeed, $2,000 and $3,000 above the MSRP. Many of us may
not like it, but the market is setting the price on the PT Cruiser.

FUND CHIEF'S RARE TRADES PAY OFF IN A BIG WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sam Isaly isn't going to make any stock trader rich. In the last
year, his mutual fund has bought a total of 12 new stocks and sold
12 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can be twisted in an amusing thought, that we work one
day a month,'' said Isaly, manager of the Eaton Vance Worldwide
Health Sciences fund.
</P>
<P>
   No one asks a fund manager how much he works. Inquiring minds
want to know how much he earns for his shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   On that score, there are mostly raves about Isaly's performance.
In an investment sector with enviable prospects, thanks to
advancing technology and a graying population, he can claim stellar
records over the recent past and the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton Vance Worldwide Health Sciences, up 32 percent so far this
year, has been earning nearly double the median returns of health
and biotechnology funds tracked by Lipper Inc. in 2000 and over the
last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The $457 million fund's one-year return of 78.4 percent, through
last week, technically ranked it eighth among the 57 sector funds
tracked by Lipper. It earned less than just one fund dedicated
broadly to health care investments. The median health care or
biotech fund earned 30.8 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Isaly's performance ranks first among that same crowd over five
years (270 percent) and third over the last 10 years (707 percent).
Isaly, 55, who has used a wheelchair since a high school spinal
cord injury, manages the Eaton Vance fund as a subadvisor from New
York, with the help of a dozen other analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Isaly's tendency to buy and hold stocks might lead you to
believe he earned his numbers by investing conservatively and
letting the rising health care tide lift the fund. Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton Vance Worldwide Health Sciences owns lots of big, global
pharmaceutical stocks, just as every other health care fund does.
But Isaly mixes those holdings with an unusually large count of
what he describes as superaggressive stock picks from around the
world, often focused on biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of the fund's assets are usually invested in
what he calls US specialty stocks. Another 5 percent are more
speculative stocks based elsewhere around the world. International
stocks account for about a third of the fund's investments.
</P>
<P>
   That's not an easy strategy to follow when the long-term outlook
for gigantic global health care stocks is so rosy. The first
pressing question: Why rock the boat?
</P>
<P>
   What happens if a fund manager underinvests in giants like
Pfizer and Warner-Lambert Co., which combined make up about 10
percent of the world's biopharmaceutical stock capitalization by
Isley's count, and those stocks roar ahead? Indexes that serve as
the benchmarks for health sector investors move with those big
stocks and will leave more speculative money managers sadly behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can compose a portfolio for the top 50 names, and you'll
get an earnings growth rate, we believe, of 12 percent,'' Isaly
said. ``Don't rock the boat; ask me to deliver you 15 percent with
some stock selection, and I probably will do that. But by moving
away from the middle of the road a bit, I'm able to add another 5
percent return.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he's added a bit more than that. Eaton Vance Worldwide
Health Science has delivered an average of 23.4 percent a year over
the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Isaly has lots of money in big names. The Eaton
Vance fund has 7.6 percent of its assets invested in
Warner-Lambert, another 4.9 percent in American Home Products
Corp., and 4.4 percent in Pharmacia AB.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also lots of lesser-known names, like LJL
Biosystems Inc. and Caliper Technologies Corp., two California
companies, and Geltex Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   One key calculation for Isaly's more adventuresome picks: He
expects most of those companies will enjoy their most vigorous
stock appreciation in a period starting two years before they first
posts profits and ending two years after the initial earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the small-stock picks: Abgenix Inc., a
biopharmaceutical stock Isaly bought for $3.37 per share in a
private placement three years ago. The stock, now one of his fund's
bigger holdings, traded at $79 per share Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of hapy to have some Warner-Lambert, Novartis, and
Roche, because they're stable growers,'' Isaly said. ``But I know
if I stick only to stable growers, I'm going to get that kind of
return. I need to keep renewing the portfolio with fuel
injection.''

<P>
   When I lay hands on an SUV, one of the first things I like to do
is take it where most SUVs never go _ off road.
</P>
<P>
   In my neck of the New Hampshire woods, that means out where the
skidders have been, following the rutted, muddy, stony, log-strewn
paths of departed or ongoing logging operations. It's a good test
for these rigs because skidders do not pause for steep or sloshy,
stone or stump.
</P>
<P>
   So where better to start my week in the 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee
Limited 4WD? It would be a good test to see if Daimler-Chrysler, in
its 1999 makeover of the Grand Cherokee, had pulled off the
Jekyll-and-Hyde feat of turning this Jeep into a luxurious and
smooth highway performer while at the same time saving its solid
off-road soul.
</P>
<P>
   I took it up steep grades where you could see only the sky
through the windshield. Plunged it through mud, walked it gingerly
over rocks and stumps one wheel at a time, pushed through a
streambed, across a thick scattering of old bark and wood chips,
coaxed it down the same steep grade it had just climbed, this time
with the front bumper seemingly ready to burrow in at any minute.
</P>
<P>
   It remains an off-road beast _ better even than its earlier
incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that has to do with its new engine, the optional
4.7-liter, 235-horsepower plant that replaces the 5.2 and 5.9
liters of old. This new powerplant has 15 more horsepower than the
old 5.2, only 10 less than the 5.9, and gets better gas mileage
than either (17 miles per gallon in off-road and highway driving).
It's a solid case of overhead cams and new technology knocking
aside the old push-rod engine.
</P>
<P>
   It has power that makes it a stubborn crawler up steep hills,
holds the nearly 2-ton rig back on steep declines, and turns it
into a guttural and strong performer on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   But what is best about this new Jeep is its new all-wheel-drive
system. Called Quadra-Trac, it is a full-time, all-wheel-drive
setup that uses sensors to shift torque front to rear, side to
side, and even to single wheels. This means that, if three wheels
are slipping and only one has the faintest hope of purchase, that
wheel gets the torque to nudge you forward. It's great off-road and
will be wonderful for commuting in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Cherokee stands apart in appearance from its more
staid stablemate, the Cherokee, because of a subtle design shift.
They still share the same mouthful-of-Chiclets grille, but on the
Grand Cherokee, that grille is angled back from bumper to hood. The
hood rises in a wedge to a more sloping windshield and a higher
roof line drops off at the rear in a rounded dip. The Cherokee
remains the angular, oblong box it has long been.
</P>
<P>
   The softer lines of the Grand Cherokee hint at the luxury inside
_ an air of comfort meant to please those who won't be chasing
skidders through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The front leather bucket seats have good support up the sides,
though they could use a bit more firmness at the thigh. The rear
bench, billed as a three-person seat, is comfortable at the doors,
but a strange notch has been cut from the cushion at the center,
leaving a middle passenger with less space on which to sit. Leg
room in the rear is a bit tight, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, all is relatively simple with window, door, and
mirror controls on the driver's side armrest, cruise control on the
steering wheel, light controls on one steering column stem, and
wipers on another. Audio and climate controls are big and easy to
use.
</P>
<P>
   Though many SUVs are built on truck platforms, Jeep has put the
new Grand Cherokee with integrated body and frame rails, making it
stiffer and more stable. As with almost any tall vehicle, you get
some sensation of side-to-side roll when cornering at higher
speeds, though the Grand Cherokee is another example of
manufacturers changing suspension and construction methods to make
them more stable than the tippy boxes of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   This model came with an ``Upcountry'' suspension system that
included high-pressure gas shocks, special front and rear springs,
and stabilizer bar. Off-road skid plates and shields were included
in this package.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed transmission did a too-quick, jerky upshift in
lower gears than I would like, but once rolling was smooth in
shifting through higher gears. Disc brakes, assisted by ABS, at all
four wheels brought it to swift, sure stops.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The auxiliary audio control buttons tucked on the backside of
the steering wheel. Felt as if I was playing a video game as I
fooled with volume and stations.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The placing of the driver's seat memory buttons on the door
panel above the armrest. My elbow kept hitting them and changing my
seat position.

NEW CHRYSLER CRUISER   BRINGS REPORTS OF GOUGING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seemed a simple enough statement: ``If you run into gouging,
let me know.'' I wrote that sentence last week and slipped it deep
into a review of the hot new Chrysler PT Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   It was in there because I'd heard reports that some dealers were
jacking up the price of the Cruiser by thousands of dollars, and
since I know folks are standing in line out there looking to buy
Cruisers, it seemed like a good idea to ask the readers. Maybe we'd
catch a couple of dealers price gouging.
</P>
<P>
   Well, a funny thing happened on the way to proving a theory.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, there was a flood of e-mail that proves to me
that, no, there aren't a handful of dealers out there ``gouging''
on the price of Cruisers. It is a widespread phenomenon, with
readers reporting jacked-up prices at Chrysler dealers in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have placed orders based on the manufacturer's
suggested retail price only to find $1,000 to $3,000 added to their
bill later. Take it or leave it, because if you don't, we'll sell
the car to someone else today, some have been told.
</P>
<P>
   Others were coldly informed that everybody's doing it, so if
they want a Cruiser, they'd better be ready to pony up the dough _
often with a hefty down payment and the prospect of months of
waiting for their car to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, asked to pay $2,000 over sticker, wrote: ``When we
told the salesman we felt like we were being gouged (at a Peabody
dealership) and that we don't even like to pay sticker, he actually
said, `Well, if you're not paying at least sticker, aren't you
gouging the dealer?''' The answer to that is no, but that's a topic
for another column.
</P>
<P>
   From Plymouth came the story of a man who was told, ``I would
have to put down $1,000 and the price would be $2,500 to $3,000
over sticker.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Woburn, another man said he waited an hour before a
Cruiser salesperson could even get to him and was then told ``the
price was $3,000 over list price.''
</P>
<P>
   Many folks wrote to say they simply walked out when they felt
they were being gouged.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the rub: Several writers pointed out that even as
they walked away from deals, there were others lurking in the
showrooms ready to plunk down what the dealers were asking.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when I started to ponder my own theories on gouging.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I raised the topic _ when writing about the Honda
S2000 _ an e-mail came my way from a man asking if, in fact,
letting demand set the price for any automobile is not simply the
fair and free market at work.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't sure how I felt about that, though I knew he had a
point. It nagged at me months later when I tested the new Toyota
MR2 Spyder, like the S2000, another hot drop-top sportscar.
</P>
<P>
   And then came 10 days in the PT Cruiser, the most gawked-at car
I have ever driven. Park it and people crowd around it. Leave it
alone and unlocked and you might return to find a stranger sitting
in the driver's seat just getting the feel of the car. Demand for
it is so high that Chrysler's initial plans to sell 50,000 Cruisers
are being re-ramped to sell as many as four times that.
</P>
<P>
   So, in fact, while there is genuine and understandable outrage
among some folks over the inflated prices _ flat-out profit-taking
by dealerships _ it is customers who are driving up the price.
</P>
<P>
   And where does that leave us on the issue of ``gouging?''
</P>
<P>
   It leaves me firmly planted on both sides of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   That's because I don't think what has happened with the Honda
and Toyota hot cars is the same as what is happening with the PT
Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because both the MR2 and the S2000 were meant to be
``halo'' cars _ vehicles whose appearance in a manufacturer's fleet
adds an aura that will help dealers across the country sell more of
that manufacturer's other cars. If you can't swing the MR2 or the
S2000, for instance, at least you'll feel better about the Accord
or Celica you do buy.
</P>
<P>
   Further, both of these are cars that the manufacturers have said
flat out were meant for dealers to use _ at very reasonable prices
_ as rewards to their most loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   As in: ``Hey, Sue, you've bought three Accords here over the
years. How'd you like to get into the hottest car we make at a very
good price?''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. Honda and Toyota let their dealers know they
did not want to see price gouging on the $23,000 MR2 or the $30,000
S2000.
</P>
<P>
   The response of many dealers? Hah! Gouging on the Honda has
reached as high as $10,000 and, on the MR2, the inflated price has
approached $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   This does not make sense to me. Neither car is being produced in
great numbers. For instance, only 5,000 MR2s will be sold in the
United States this year. That means most dealers will get only a
couple of the cars to sell and some may get none.
</P>
<P>
   And those who do get them and who gouge on the price are selling
the potential for great good will for what can only be a few
thousand dollars of profit. A drop of cash, probably, in the annual
bucket of profits.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, I consider hugely inflated prices on these limited
edition vehicles to be gouging. Dealers are gouging their buyers
and, stupidly, they are gouging themselves by tainting what could
be a well of good will.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruiser, however, seems to me another matter. If, in fact,
its annual sales get into the hundreds of thousands and people are
lined up to buy them at the higher prices, then I guess that is the
free market at work _ fairly. Chrysler is not telling dealers to
back off. Buyers are telling dealers they'll pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   Across a broad range of demographics Americans are saying a fair
price is, indeed, $2,000 and $3,000 above the MSRP. Many of us may
not like it, but the market is setting the price on the PT Cruiser.

&HT;     JOSEPH O'DONOHUE, ONE-TIME SOCIALITE, DIES AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAY DELGADO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Joseph J. O'Donohue IV, a former New York
socialite who moved to San Francisco after squandering his fortune,
died Wednesday after a heart attack. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donohue, once dubbed ``the most beautiful boy in New York,''
was well known in New York City's social circles, entertaining
celebrities Josephine Baker, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Gore
Vidal and assorted royalty. He also traveled frequently to Germany
in the 1930s, where he once dined with Adolf Hitler and expressed
his disapproval of the Fuhrer's anti-Jewish policies.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive spending and bad money management ended the
high-flying lifestyle O'Donohue had become accustomed to and in
1958 he moved to San Francisco, where he led a relatively quiet
life that included friendships with the city's social circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love people to remember Joe O'Donohue as a real true
gentleman and one of the last true San Francisco characters,'' said
David Perry, a close friend and a free-lance writer who had been
working with O'Donohue on his memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donohue was born on Jan. 28, 1912, in New York to a family
that had amassed a considerable fortune, mainly through real estate
holdings and the operation of a ferry service between Manhattan and
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Entertaining and being entertained by socialites, actors,
authors and politicians in New York in the 1920s and 1930s,
O'Donohue was also very passionate about ballet, holding a row of
seats at the New York Ballet and hosting lavish parties for dancers
at his Park Avenue apartment.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donohue spent summers in Germany in the 1930s, hobnobbing with
titled nobility and chancellors, culminating in an encounter over
coffee with Hitler, where he complained about the leader's
anti-Jewish policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things got somewhat tense for a moment,'' O'Donohue recalled
in a 1988 interview with the San Francisco Examiner. ``I don't
think he particularly liked my telling him his idea was wrong, but
I had to in all honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. O'Donohue walked away from the meeting with an autographed
picture of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   World War II ended much of the lavishness that O'Donohue had
experienced throughout his life and he had to tap into his share of
the family fortune to pay off debts and cover for bad financial
planning, leaving him strapped for cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fortune, I simply did away with it,'' O'Donohue said in the
Examiner article. ``Bad advice, bad lawyers, bad taxes _ it
survived the Depression but it didn't survive me. I've accomplished
so little except passing through life causing no harm _ and totally
demolishing and destroying a fifth-generation estate. With glee!''
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, O'Donohue considered his move to San Francisco
his exile from upper-crust society. He survived on a limited
pension, but he still managed to become close friends with San
Francisco socialites.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donohue is survived by cousins Jack and Claudia Steers of
Connecticut and film director Mel Ferrer of Carpinteria, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   His remains will be cremated and buried in New York at the
family's cemetery plot.

CAN YOU BUY AN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP?

   &UR; BY MALCOLM GLADWELL &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons for last year's NBA lockout was that
owners wanted to impose some sort of fiscal discipline on the game.
They didn't want basketball to turn into the farce that is modern
baseball, where a handful of teams with the deepest pockets
monopolize all the best free agents and, as a result, all the
championships.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the NBA's new Collective Bargaining Agreement
imposes a salary cap to limit the payrolls of individual teams and
also has a luxury tax _ to begin in the 2001-2002 season _ to
penalize those teams that exceed the cap.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at the current salary structure of the league, it
looks as if that effort at discipline is working. Virtually all of
the most successful teams have payrolls within the fairly narrow
range of $45 million to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   (One way to look at this is to think in terms of a basketball
price/earnings ratio, where price is the number of millions a team
spends on players' salaries and earnings are wins. Most good teams
have p/e ratios of less than one: Miami [.978], Utah [.984],
Phoenix [.877], Philadelphia [.863] are typical, meaning that in
the NBA right now the consensus is that you have to spend just
under a million dollars to ``buy'' a regular season win.)
</P>
<P>
   The cap is also credited with the emergence of highly
cost-conscious rebuilding strategies in places like Chicago and
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Lakers sources said that owner Jerry Buss
was balking at paying Shaquille O'Neal the full $83.5 million,
three-year contract extension Shaq is due in 2003 because Buss
didn't want to pay the luxury tax. That sounds like fiscal
discipline is working. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually not. And for proof look no further than this
year's playoffs, where the final four teams also happen to be the
teams with the four highest payrolls. In fact, Portland ($73.9
million) and New York ($71.3 million) are spending almost $20
million more on players than the third highest-spending team and
$30 million more than the average for most competitive franchises.
(The p/e for the Trail Blazers is 1.25 and for the Knicks an
outsize 1.426.)
</P>
<P>
   Portland and New York, quite simply, bought their way into this
year's playoffs, which, under the collective bargaining agreement,
wasn't supposed to happen. What went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that the agreement has a crippling loophole. First
of all, the NBA has what is called a ``soft'' cap (unlike the NFL,
which has a ``hard'' cap), in order to promote stability. What that
means is that a team is allowed to exceed the cap in order to
re-sign its own free agents.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if I'm Orlando and I want to sign Tim Duncan
this off-season, I'm limited by how much room I have under the cap.
If I'm San Antonio, trying to re-sign Duncan, I can pay him
whatever I want. The soft cap explains why Portland has a payroll
of almost $74 million, even though the cap is $34 million: They are
awfully generous when it comes to re-signing players.
</P>
<P>
   To rein in teams that over-exploit the soft cap, the collective
bargaining agreement also includes a luxury tax. According to a
complicated formula, a second cap is created _ significantly higher
than the first _ and for every dollar a team is over the second
cap, they're required to pay a dollar in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   But here's where the loophole comes in. The second cap doesn't
automatically apply to big spenders. It kicks in only when the
total of all players' salaries exceeds 61.1 percent of total
basketball revenues for that year. And that 61.1 percent is a very
generous level. In all, it's never been breached.
</P>
<P>
   Last year _ prorated for a full season _ players' salaries were
about 58 percent of revenue. This year, even after players'
salaries jumped a whopping 18 percent in the off-season, the
National Basketball Players Association estimates they'll reach
only about 59 percent of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, for course, that by 2001-2002, when the luxury
tax kicks in for the first time, continued salary inflation will
have pushed us above that mark. But that season, it should be
pointed out, will be the fourth and final year of the NBA's
television deal with NBC. And if, as expected, the next deal is
more lucrative, the share of revenues taken up by salaries is going
to fall again. The luxury tax may well only be a one-year
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The genius _ if you want to call it that _ of the Trail Blazers
and the Knicks, in other words, is that they recognized, in advance
of everyone else, that the luxury tax was essentially toothless. So
long as most NBA teams exercise some restraint _ which most owners
clearly want to do _ the system allows teams like the Knicks and
Trail Blazers to spend all they want.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Clippers spend only $22.5 million and the
Bulls spend $27 million means that Portland can get away with
paying Damon Stoudamire $10 million a year and Jermaine O'Neal _
Jermaine O'Neal! _ $5 million a year. It's hard to comprehend just
how idiotic this system is.
</P>
<P>
   The reason we have regulatory or enforcement systems of any sort
_ from the IRS to police departments _ is not because most of us
want to break the law; it's because a tiny minority wants to break
the law. Professional sports are no different. Competitive
inequities are caused by the actions of a small number of owners
like George Steinbrenner or Peter Angelos or Paul Allen who, by
virtue of their temperament or deep pockets, are willing to pay
anything for a winner. A solution that gives the profligate few
carte blanche is not a solution.
</P>
<P>
   We gave up half the season last year for this?

&HT;     JUDGE IN S.F. NEWSPAPER CASE PROMISES A PROMPT RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker, hearing
final arguments in Clint Reilly's antitrust suit to block the
Hearst Corp. from buying the San Francisco Chronicle, pointedly
questioned lawyers about Hearst's plan to give the Fang family a
$66 million subsidy to buy its Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you conclude that the only purpose for which that
subsidy is being paid is to curry favor with the Department of
Justice and local political authorities?'' Walker asked a lawyer
for the Chronicle on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, the judge sharply questioned the U.S. Justice
Department's assertion that the Fangs would produce an Examiner
that was fully competitive with Hearst's Chronicle, remarking,
``that's certainly not what the evidence suggests is going to
happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   And under questioning by the judge, a Hearst lawyer revealed
that the Justice Department had threatened to sue Hearst for
antitrust violations if it did not sell The Examiner to the Fangs,
who publish the free three-times-a-week San Francisco Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Walker heard more than five hours of arguments from the lawyers
in the unprecedented trial. He homed in on whether Reilly, a real
estate investor and 1999 mayoral candidate, had legal standing to
bring the suit, whether Hearst's sale of The Examiner to the Fangs
was legitimate, and the $66 million subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing in the overflowing courtroom on the 17th floor of
the Phillip Burton Federal Building ended the nation's first-ever
trial on the dissolution of a joint operating agreement between
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements are allowed under an exemption to antitrust laws
that Reilly contends has been misused by publishers around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he would attempt to rule promptly. Lawyers in the
case speculated he would decide within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision could dramatically affect the future of San
Francisco's daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Walker indicated he is considering the legality of the Examiner
and Chronicle sales separately. He could approve or bar both deals,
or approve the Chronicle sale and nix the Examiner sale, lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's sale of The Examiner to the Fangs is contingent on its
purchase of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly is asking Walker to permanently bar both newspaper deals
on the ground that they violate antitrust laws and the Newspaper
Preservation Act.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants Walker to nullify two clauses in Hearst's joint
operating agreement with the Chronicle that, he claims, unfairly
exclude other potential buyers for the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly alleges that Hearst's proposed deals would leave Hearst
with the only metropolitan daily newspaper in San Francisco, an
illegal monopoly that would reduce the number of editorial voices
and raise advertising and subscription rates.
</P>
<P>
   He claims Hearst's deal to sell The Examiner to the Fangs _ and
give them a subsidy of up to $66 million over three years _ is a
sham, because the subsidy is insufficient to publish a viable
competitor to the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, Chronicle Publishing Co. and the Fangs have denied
Reilly's claims and are asking Walker to let the deals proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hearing neat summations of the two-week trial, which
began May 1 and was put over for final arguments, Walker turned
Wednesday's hearing into an extended colloquy.
</P>
<P>
   Walker by turns questioned and challenged the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Alioto argued first, presenting Reilly's side for
nearly two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto began by claiming that the newspaper industry in general,
and Hearst and Chronicle in particular, had misused their privilege
under the Newspaper Preservation Act as a ``stepping stone to
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, The Examiner and Chronicle have had a joint
operating agreement under which they pool all revenue, use it to
pay their combined costs of printing, circulation and advertising
operations, and split the remainder evenly. Each paper then pays
the costs of its independent editorial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Such agreements are allowed under the act, an exemption from
antitrust laws meant to keep alive newspapers in danger of failing
due to declining circulation _ in this case The Examiner _ so
communities could benefit from multiple editorial voices.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Alioto argued, Hearst was trying to close or sell The
Examiner on the basis that it was failing and buy the Chronicle. He
claimed that would violate the papers' duty under the act to
maintain the joint operating agreement until it expires in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the court does not prohibit Hearst from buying the
Chronicle, then it's a road map to monopoly in any city,'' Alioto
said. Newspapers in 13 cities have joint operating agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Walker interrupted to ask Alioto how Hearst's plan to sell The
Examiner to the Fangs fit in with his antitrust claim.
</P>
<P>
   Even it if were a ``pure political ploy on Hearst's part to
curry favor with City Hall and the Department of Justice,'' Walker
asked, how was that an antitrust violation?
</P>
<P>
   Alioto replied that the deal amounted to an illegal combination
between the Fangs and Hearst, saying they never intended to have
truly competing papers.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner sale to the Fangs, Alioto argued, was a ``down and
dirty bribe.''
</P>
<P>
   He claimed that in return for getting the deal, the Fangs used
their political connections to generate support for Hearst's
purchase of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle deal had been opposed by Mayor Willie Brown and
other local politicians, as well as the U.S. Justice Department,
which had said San Francisco should have competing daily
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's antitrust department was investigating
Hearst's plan to buy the Chronicle, as was the San Francisco
district attorney and city attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto argued that Hearst executives agreed to the Fang deal to
placate local politicians.
</P>
<P>
   When Walker questioned whether Reilly had standing to bring the
suit, Alioto said the Clayton Antitrust Act allowed any person to
sue to stop the threatened antitrust activity.
</P>
<P>
   Walker noted that Reilly would still have two newspapers after
the deals go through, ``so he's certainly not injured as a consumer
of newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Alioto argued that the Fangs' Examiner would not be a viable
alternative to Hearst's Chronicle, depriving Reilly and other
consumers of comparable alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto also argued that Walker should void two clauses in the
joint operating agreement that, he says, unfairly prevented other
major media companies from buying the Chronicle and competing with
Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   A ``first right of refusal'' clause gives each partner in the
agreement the chance to outbid any other potential buyer of the
other partner's paper. The other clause bars any firm that owns a
paper within 60 miles of San Francisco from becoming a partner in
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said it's easy to see how the clauses might harm the
Chronicle by fending off bidders, but asked how they hurt consumers
like Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said the clauses threatened to give Hearst a newspaper
monopoly that would harm consumers by offering fewer newspapers and
higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   When Walker questioned J. Thomas Rosch, a lawyer for Chronicle
Publishing, the judge asked whether economic policy wasn't better
served by simply shutting The Examiner rather than giving the Fangs
$66 million and letting The Examiner suffer a slow death.
</P>
<P>
   Rosch agreed the money would be better spent on making the
Chronicle a stronger competitor against other Bay Area media.
</P>
<P>
   That led Walker to ask, ``Can't you conclude that the only
purpose for which that subsidy is being paid is to curry favor with
the Department of Justice and local political authorities?''
</P>
<P>
   Rosch deferred the matter to the other lawyers, and contended
that Reilly lacked standing to sue because he had failed to show he
would suffer actual harm as a result of the proposed newspaper
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Rosch reaffirmed his view that the two restrictive clauses in
the joint operating agreement are not exempt from antitrust law,
meaning Walker could find them illegal. But Rosch disputed Alioto's
contention that the measures had deterred other bidders for the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Halling, a Hearst lawyer, also denied Alioto's claim that
Hearst had used the 60-mile restriction and first right of refusal
to get an unfair advantage over other potential bidders for the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no misuse of the joint operating agreement in any
sense,'' Halling said. ``Hearst had the rights it had and had the
position it had simply as a matter of private contract.''
</P>
<P>
   But Halling, disagreeing with Rosch, said the clauses were
exempt from antitrust law and therefore less likely to be voided.
</P>
<P>
   Halling argued that Hearst had agreed to pay more for the
Chronicle than Knight-Ridder and other bidders because Hearst
already owned half the printing presses it shares with the
Chronicle, and by buying the Chronicle's half would own the whole
printing operation. Other bidders, in contrast, would have to spend
more to get a complete press.
</P>
<P>
   Walker questioned why Hearst agreed to give the Fangs a subsidy
to buy The Examiner instead of simply closing The Examiner as a
failing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wasn't it shut down?'' the judge asked. ``Why didn't
Hearst say to everybody who was trying to influence Hearst to sell
The Examiner, `It's a dead newspaper. It's better buried?' Why
didn't Hearst just stick to its principles in this matter and take
the political risk that attended that?''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, Halling replied, had a deadline to buy the Chronicle and
feared that the pending investigations could delay the deals.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's contract to buy the Chronicle expires June 28, after
which the Chronicle Publishing Co. may walk away from the deal,
Hearst's Senior Vice President James M. Asher said in an interview.
Chronicle Publishing could put the paper up for sale anew, keep it,
or exercise a separate right to extend the contract through
October, Asher said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker suggested that Hearst, the Fangs and the Justice
Department all had been misleading in claiming the Fangs would
produce a metropolitan daily newspaper that would fully compete
with Hearst's Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Halling denied Hearst had said that.
</P>
<P>
   Walker quoted the Justice Department's press release, which
said, ``For the first time in 35 years San Francisco will have two
independent daily newspapers'' _ which the judge said referred to
1965 when the Chronicle and The Examiner were both metropolitan
morning papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly not what the evidence suggests is going to
happen here,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Connell, another Hearst lawyer, discounted what he called
Alioto's claim of a ``rather spectacular conspiracy involving the
attorney general of the United States, the mayor of the city, the
Fangs, the Hearsts, and maybe a few others.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst had told the department that ``there was no life left in
The Examiner,'' Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``What we were hearing, your honor, was if you
are going to close down The Examiner, we are going to sue you.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a suit and to hasten its purchase of the Chronicle,
Hearst agreed to the Fang deal, said Connell.

three-year contract extension Shaq is due in 2003 because Buss
didn't want to pay the luxury tax. That sounds like fiscal
discipline is working. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually not. And for proof look no further than this
year's playoffs, where the final four teams also happen to be the
teams with the four highest payrolls. In fact, Portland ($73.9
million) and New York ($71.3 million) are spending almost $20
million more on players than the third highest-spending team and
$30 million more than the average for most competitive franchises.
(The p/e for the Trail Blazers is 1.25 and for the Knicks an
outsize 1.426.)
</P>
<P>
   Portland and New York, quite simply, bought their way into this
year's playoffs, which, under the collective bargaining agreement,
wasn't supposed to happen. What went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that the agreement has a crippling loophole. First
of all, the NBA has what is called a ``soft'' cap (unlike the NFL,
which has a ``hard'' cap), in order to promote stability. What that
means is that a team is allowed to exceed the cap in order to
re-sign its own free agents.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if I'm Orlando and I want to sign Tim Duncan
this off-season, I'm limited by how much room I have under the cap.
If I'm San Antonio, trying to re-sign Duncan, I can pay him
whatever I want. The soft cap explains why Portland has a payroll
of almost $74 million, even though the cap is $34 million: They are
awfully generous when it comes to re-signing players.
</P>
<P>
   To rein in teams that over-exploit the soft cap, the collective
bargaining agreement also includes a luxury tax. According to a
complicated formula, a second cap is created _ significantly higher
than the first _ and for every dollar a team is over the second
cap, they're required to pay a dollar in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   But here's where the loophole comes in. The second cap doesn't
automatically apply to big spenders. It kicks in only when the
total of all players' salaries exceeds 61.1 percent of total
basketball revenues for that year. And that 61.1 percent is a very
generous level. In all, it's never been breached.
</P>
<P>
   Last year _ prorated for a full season _ players' salaries were
about 58 percent of revenue. This year, even after players'
salaries jumped a whopping 18 percent in the off-season, the
National Basketball Players Association estimates they'll reach
only about 59 percent of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, for course, that by 2001-2002, when the luxury
tax kicks in for the first time, continued salary inflation will
have pushed us above that mark. But that season, it should be
pointed out, will be the fourth and final year of the NBA's
television deal with NBC. And if, as expected, the next deal is
more lucrative, the share of revenues taken up by salaries is going
to fall again. The luxury tax may well only be a one-year
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The genius _ if you want to call it that _ of the Trail Blazers
and the Knicks, in other words, is that they recognized, in advance
of everyone else, that the luxury tax was essentially toothless. So
long as most NBA teams exercise some restraint _ which most owners
clearly want to do _ the system allows teams like the Knicks and
Trail Blazers to spend all they want.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Clippers spend only $22.5 million and the
Bulls spend $27 million means that Portland can get away with
paying Damon Stoudamire $10 million a year and Jermaine O'Neal _
Jermaine O'Neal! _ $5 million a year. It's hard to comprehend just
how idiotic this system is.
</P>
<P>
   The reason we have regulatory or enforcement systems of any sort
_ from the IRS to police departments _ is not because most of us
want to break the law; it's because a tiny minority wants to break
the law. Professional sports are no different. Competitive
inequities are caused by the actions of a small number of owners
like George Steinbrenner or Peter Angelos or Paul Allen who, by
virtue of their temperament or deep pockets, are willing to pay
anything for a winner. A solution that gives the profligate few
carte blanche is not a solution.
</P>
<P>
   We gave up half the season last year for this?

MANUFACTURING GREW AT SLOWER PACE IN MAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Activity in the nation's factories continued to grow in May, yet
at a slower pace than in recent months, as new orders for
manufactured goods moderated and upward pressures for raw materials
prices eased, the National Association of Purchasing Management
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The NAPM report on business, a broad measure of activity for the
U.S. manufacturing sector, dropped to 53.2 in May, compared to 54.9
in April. While a reading above 50 denotes growing business for
manufacturers, the decline in May suggests that growth in factory
activity is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   The index fell below the Reuters consensus forecast of
economists, which had anticipated a 55.3 reading. That helped to
boost U.S. financial markets Thursday, as investors interpreted the
data as a suggestion that the six short-term interest rate hikes by
the Federal Reserve are slowing the economy, and that future rate
increases may not be as extensive as previously thought. The report
showed a sharp deceleration in the recent rapid rise in costs for
input prices that manufacturers pay for raw materials. The NAPM
price index dropped to 65.8 in May from 76 in April and 79.8 in
March. That means manufacturers, who have been struggling with
higher prices for commodities, energy and wholesale goods, might be
starting to get some relief.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists and policymakers have feared that increased
commodity, energy and wholesale costs in recent months could lead
to a broader outbreak of inflation as manufacturers pass the costs
on to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though there is still significant pricing power in many of the
basic commodities, the decline in the rate of acceleration of the
prices index in April and May continues to be viewed as positive
and ultimately should reduce the upward pressure on prices,'' said
Norbert J. Ore, chair of the NAPM business survey committee.
</P>
<P>
   The report also showed a marked decline in the pace of orders
for manufactured goods being submitted to factories. The new orders
index fell to 51.1 in May from 56.3 in April, and indication that
activity could continue to slow as businesses brace for slower
economic times by reducing their inventories.

RUSH HOUR

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Guerrillas dented our taxi and we had trouble
hearing the sheik over the explosions across the street.
</P>
<P>
   But, at least we missed the jackal.
</P>
<P>
   We're pretty sure that was the large, dog-like, thing that
jogged across the road in front of our car at one point in our
two-day road trip through southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Zipping around south, with its farmlands, mountain villages and
open roads, should be easy. But, we were there as Israel ended its
occupation, hastily pulling out of the mountaintop bunkers it held
for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The south is normally home for more than 100,000 Lebanese.
Others, who fled after Israel's invasion in 1982, returned for the
first time after the withdrawal last week(week of May 24).
</P>
<P>
   With Lebanon being smaller than Connecticut, the rest of the
country drove down to check it out, too. They managed to create
gridlock where there isn't even a grid.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrilla groups commandeered abandoned tanks and rumbled down
the narrow roads like impromptu military parades. Soldiers on top
waved flags and fired their assault rifles in the air to the shouts
of bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   And, there were lots of cars. We saw 10 children and adults
packed into a '70s model Toyota. The parents hadn't seen their home
village for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   Near them, a Shiite Muslim woman in a black head scarf drove a
late model gray Mercedes-Benz with a large yellow Hezbollah _ the
``Party of God'' _ flag propped in the passenger window.
</P>
<P>
   Many people touring the area had not been there for over 20
years and even natives had to stop frequently to ask directions.
</P>
<P>
   Crossroads would jam like downtown intersections. Then, militia
members with assault rifles would emerge to direct traffic. They
weren't Hezbollah, but motley bands that could pose problems later.
Still, they got the traffic moving.
</P>
<P>
   I was with two colleagues and a translator. Our driver, George
Haddad, did not get out of Beirut much and was thrilled at the
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know my country,'' he chirped in his rudimentary
English as we stopped repeatedly for directions. ``It is my
country, but I do not know it. I live here, but I do not know my
country.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was also a former war zone under a dangerous
transition. There were no police and lots of left over munitions.
</P>
<P>
   One man who gave us directions told us that his cousin, a
15-year-old, had just been killed. The boy had ransacked a post of
the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army, or SLA, and brought home
what appeared to be a camera. It blew up.
</P>
<P>
   A day before the withdrawal was complete, Israeli or SLA
artillery inexplicably hit a Mercedes-Benz killing a driver for the
British Broadcasting Company.
</P>
<P>
   We were safe and had better luck. It seemed like we found
everything we needed on the road _ government ministers willing to
interview, families reuniting after decades.
</P>
<P>
   We spotted a high-ranking Hezbollah cleric by the road. Sheik
Mohammed Kawtharani, in his turban and robe, was standing next to
his Mercedes and bodyguards. We interviewed him in a house nearby.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that some Lebanese guerrillas, in a rush to remove
an abandoned jeep, whacked our parked taxi, much to our driver's
consternation.
</P>
<P>
   And, the SLA had blown up an munitions dump across the street.
It was on fire now, and the periodic booms sent ordinance and earth
into the air.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Kawtharani's entourage offered us the customary
coffee and cigarettes, the room was filled with smoke anyway _ and
we were headed back into traffic.

&HT;     TEXAS PROPOSES TOUGHENING RULES FOR SHRIMPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUSSELL GOLD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Wary of a declining shrimp population, Texas
Parks and Wildlife officials have released a revised set of
proposed rules to scale back shrimping operations in the state's
bays and offshore waters.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules come a month after an advisory panel of shrimpers
voted down more severe limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We listened,'' Parks Executive Director Andrew Sansom said. As
a result, parks officials drew up a less sweeping set of
regulations that were released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even with revisions, many shrimpers feel the rules will drive
many boats into bankruptcy. The new regulations are likely to be
imposed later in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Thuy Vu, a shrimper in Palacios and member of the state's Shrimp
Advisory Committee, said there is not enough evidence of an
impending collapse of the shrimp harvest to warrant the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no biological crisis, why do we have to rush into
this?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The next couple of months are among the busiest in for
shrimpers.
</P>
<P>
   Parks and Wildlife officials have warned that shrimp fishing
could collapse if current depletion trends are not reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Osborn, coastal fisheries director, said an 18-month study
showed adult shrimp were being caught before they reproduced. This
is compounded by a 39-year decline in the shrimp population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there is a lot of room for debate about how many
shrimp there are in the world,'' he said, but short of draining the
Gulf of Mexico, an exact count is impossible. The signs, he said,
clearly point in the direction of a pending collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The rules released Wednesday are intended to reverse that trend.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules would close an additional 6 percent of bays
and estuaries to trawlers and ban shrimping in state waters, which
extend out to a depth of 60 feet, south of Corpus Christi and
outside the barrier islands.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, shrimpers would have to increase the mesh size of
their nets. The rules also would lop 15 days off the fall season,
but extend the winter season by allowing shrimping at night.
</P>
<P>
   But the rules no longer include provisions such as shortening
the winter and spring seasons by a combined 45 days and requiring
shrimpers in the fall to return to port by 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists warmly greeted the decision to shut off
shrimping south of Corpus Christi, the home region of the
endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtle.
</P>
<P>
   The Parks and Wildlife Department will hold a series of public
hearings on the proposed rules, including meetings in Rockport on
June 27, Port Isabel on June 29 and Corpus Christi on July 18.

`LIVE VIRGIN': SO CRUDE EVEN DADDY THE PORN KING DISAPPROVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a conundrum: How can a movie effectively satirize the
bottom-feeding world of talk show television without stooping to
its level of prurience and being as crude and boisterous as a
roaring, profanity-spattered brawl on ``The Jerry Springer Show''?
The answer, of course, is that it can't. But that's not necessarily
a bad thing as long as the movie wears its nose-thumbing attitude
on its sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   During much of ``Live Virgin,'' the farcical tale of a Los
Angeles pornography kingpin who goes on the warpath after his
rebellious daughter arranges to be deflowered ($200,000) on her
18th birthday on pay-per-view television, the movie's blunt sexual
humor succeeds in staying one outrageous step ahead of Springer.
Only at the end, when the movie retracts its bloody claws and opts
for a halfheartedly sentimental conclusion, does ``Live Virgin''
lose its considerable nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Until that moment, ``Live Virgin'' should tickle the revenge
fantasies of anyone who has chortled in disgust at the hypocrisy of
a format that peddles freak show voyeurism in the guise of truth
and emotional healing. The movie's ruthless porn merchants and talk
show personnel, who suddenly turn pious when what they do for a
living comes too close to home, are skewered with a mockery as
funny as it is scalding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live Virgin'' adds an extra blip of futuristic fantasy by
having the pay-per-view customers, whom it portrays as panting,
sex-starved geeks, buy special outfits in which they wire
themselves through the telephone to have a vicariously
``authentic'' sexual experience. For in the world of ``Live
Virgin,'' technology has advanced to the point where it is possible
to have remote-control intercourse through electrical stimulation
and body-part attachments. The process, which isn't spelled out, is
clearly the next step in home entertainment beyond virtual reality.
In a nifty comic touch, these auto-erotic body suits make those who
wear them look like space travelers dressed as Kermit the Frog.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's casting coup is having the rebel daughter, Katrina,
played by Mena Suvari, who was so memorable as a potty-mouthed,
pseudosophisticated Lolita in ``American Beauty.'' In that movie,
Suvari was the sultry blond incarnation of every middle-aged man's
lustful cheerleader fantasy. Here the actress, giving a performance
that's not so assured as her ``American Beauty'' vixen, is
brown-haired until nearly the end. Preparatory to her $200,000
payoff, she is crowned with a ludicrous black wig for a scene in
which she plays a soft-core Joan of Arc being tried in a court
where the aristocrats are too busy having sex to pay attention to
the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live Virgin,'' directed by Jean-Pierre Marois from a
screenplay he wrote with Ira Israel, is as tightly plotted as a
standard French farce. It happens that the producer of the
televised deflowering, Joey Quinn (Bob Hoskins), is the former
protege and partner of Katrina's porno-king daddy, Ronny Bartoloti
(Robert Loggia parodying Robert Guccione).
</P>
<P>
   Years earlier, Ronny stole away Joey's bimbo of a wife, Raquel
(Bobbie Phillips), who is first shown lolling in a bubble bath and
whining about the rigors of plastic surgery. For years, Joey has
been sexually impotent, a condition to which the movie alludes in
several nastily funny comic bits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Katrina is being ardently pursued by her dewy-eyed
high school sweetheart, Brian (Gabriel Mann), with whom she broke
up under the mistaken assumption that he had slept with another
girl. Brian happens to be son of Quaint McPherson (Sally
Kellerman), the imperious talk-show host who is overseeing the
television special.
</P>
<P>
   With her honeyed voice dripping with solicitous hauteur,
Kellerman's dead-on parody of Sally Jessy Raphael by way of Diane
Sawyer skewers the bogus empathy that these multimillion-dollar
television personalities can turn on and off with the flick of a
switch. Although Quaint is jittery with excitement about the
sky-high ratings the show is expected to garner, she is absolutely
mortified that her darling son should be enamored of Katrina.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Live Virgin'' fearlessly lurches forward (this is not a
graceful movie), it takes gleeful swipes at everything and everyone
in its path until its cop-out of a denouement. Had the movie had
the courage to go all the way with its satire, it would have
contrived a socko ending reminiscent of the Terry Southern-Mason
Hoffenberg novel ``Candy.'' Oh, well, the movie still works. How
unsubtle is it? The American flag flown proudly in the front yard
of Ronny's Hollywood palace of a home says it all.

&HT;     HINDU FINDS GRADUATION PRAYER OFFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By J. MICHAEL PARKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Gracious heavenly Father,'' ``in your name'' and ``amen'' _
expressions taken for granted among Christians at prayer _
sometimes seem grating to non-Christians when uttered at public
events.
</P>
<P>
   Those words angered a group of Hindu families attending a
graduation ceremony at a San Antonio high school last weekend,
although the school's principal is satisfied the prayers fit legal
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime this month, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to
clarify when and how prayer may be included in public school
events, when it announces a decision in a case challenging
student-led prayer at high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruled against such prayers in a case
originating in the Santa Fe School District in Galveston County,
Texas, but differentiated between games and graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, Alex Salinas, who attended Madison High School's
commencement last Saturday, said the invocation and benediction
clearly were sectarian and insensitive to non-Christians in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Christian denominational prayer rather than a generic
prayer,'' said Salinas, a practicing Hindu.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 10-to-12 Hindu families went out to eat at an Indian
restaurant Saturday after the Madison graduation ceremony, and
everybody was talking about it,'' Salinas said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hadn't thought much about it during the invocation,
but when similar wording was repeated in the benediction at the end
of the ceremony, he found it offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no warning that it was a Christian prayer. We were
all required to stand and participate. It was very offensive,
especially because there have been many Hindu temples burned by
Christians in various parts of the world,'' Salinas said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed the offense was unintentional but could
reflect a subtle influence by Christian conservatives on school
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for blood. I'm just looking for an admission
by school officials that what they did was wrong,'' Salinas said.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Principal Bobby Smith said the prayers were written and
delivered by students. He said he had read both of them and
believed they were appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can appreciate Mr. Salinas' convictions, and I respect them
wholeheartedly. We're not in the business of imposing religion on
anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he apologized privately to Salinas, but Salinas said
he wanted a public apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't feel like we did anything wrong, but I
apologized to him and his family for any feeling they have that we
offended them,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   However the Supreme Court rules in the Santa Fe case, Smith said
he would abide by it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A ruling by the high court could help set clearer boundaries for
when prayers are appropriate, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 Texas case, Jones vs. Clear Creek School District, a
federal appeals court found public school graduation prayers
constitutional if they are ``nonsectarian'' and
``nonproselytizing.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans on Tuesday, a panel of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court
of Appeals dismissed a lawsuit against the Aledo (Texas) School
District on allegations it infringed on her right to present a
prayer. Katherine Hackleman Furley sued the district in May after a
school district attorney deleted parts of a prayer she had written
for graduation day.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Boston, assistant director of communications for Americans
United for Separation of Church and State, said he expects the high
court's decision to clear up confusion over prayers at graduation
ceremonies and other school-sponsored gatherings, not just athletic
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clear Creek decision was nonsensical. As a practical
matter, there's no such thing as a nonsectarian prayer. Hinduism is
a polytheistic religion, so to a Hindu, any prayer to one God is
sectarian,'' Boston said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rao Pemmeraju, a former president of the Hindu Temple of San
Antonio, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Hindu faith, there is only one God, but God can have
many manifestations and many names. We believe we're all children
of God, and we don't believe Hinduism is the only way to salvation.
God is in you and me and everyone,'' Pemmeraju said.
</P>
<P>
   He said most Hindus wouldn't have been offended by the Madison
student's prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Many have tried to water down prayers in an effort to find an
inoffensive compromise, but there is no such thing, Boston said.
</P>
<P>
   His own group has suggested those who want a religious component
to graduation ceremonies could organize a private baccalaureate
ceremony at a church.

`THIRTEEN': YES, A CAR WOULD MAKE EVERYTHING PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITORS: ``Thirteen'' was shown as part of the 1998 New
Directors/New Films Series. Here are excerpts from Stephen Holden's
review, which appeared in The New York Times on April 4.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Williams' movie ``Thirteen'' belongs to a
burgeoning genre that determinedly blurs the line between fiction
and documentary filmmaking. Largely improvised, with no screenplay
and featuring a cast that includes untrained actors as well as
professionals, this portrait of a sullen, quirky 13-year-old black
girl growing up in Richmond, Va., feels utterly real during much
(though not all) of its 87 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Nina (Wilhamenia Dickens), the movie's unsmiling central
character, is a tomboyish adolescent who shortly after her 13th
birthday becomes withdrawn and stops speaking. One day she simply
disappears from the house where she lives with her salty,
God-fearing mother, Lillian (Lillian Folley), who narrates the
film. When Nina reappears several days later from an autumnal trek
into the Virginia mountains, she is a bit less glum than before.
</P>
<P>
   While she wanders through the countryside contemplating her
life, Nina decides that the one thing she wants more than anything
is to own a car. Much of the rest of the film follows her around as
she futilely tries to earn enough money to buy one. She applies for
various entry-level jobs, works as a baby sitter, cares for
people's pets and sits for a portrait painted by a mediocre local
artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirteen'' brings in a lot of peripheral characters, some of
whom are inadequately identified. Among its more awkward moments
are brief flashbacks of Nina's adventures in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   For all its narrative glitches and its homemade quality,
``Thirteen'' evokes the rhythm, texture and tone of Nina's world in
a way that a more carefully scripted film never could. It reminds
you of how mysterious and complex individual character really is.
Nina's obsession with cars and her way of suddenly bursting out
with blunt observations and demands make for a fascinating portrait
of a shy, strong-willed girl whose mind is churning as she tries to
figure out the world and her future.
</P>
<P>
   Folley's Lillian is ``real'' in much the same way. Deeply
religious but not conventionally devout, Lillian is sure that she
will eventually go to heaven. While the character is by no means a
goody-goody, you feel that if heaven did exist, she would probably
be welcomed there.

WHERE I SEEM TO FIND THE HAPPINESS I SEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., June 4)  
 By WENDY WASSERSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Standing in front of 200 earnest female faces and a smattering
of sympathetic men at a recent Harvard Hillel conference on
``superwomen,'' I realized my customary ironic autobiographical
anecdotes were falling flat. This audience expected substance, a
concrete point of view on ``having it all'' _ plus relevant thought
on the future of feminism, not to mention Judaism. And I was
offering my best stories about my mother.
</P>
<P>
   But five minutes into what I feared could become a debacle, a
movie musical began. My nephew Ben, a freshman, strode into the
room with six young men, all in black tie. As they climbed the
steps to the back row of the lecture hall, I pictured them breaking
into an updated version of the Cole Porter classic ``Anything
Goes!'' I was especially pleased that in my movie-musical fantasy,
a Yale man was providing the melody and lyrics for a Harvard
musical.
</P>
<P>
   The mere thought of them elegantly tapping up the stairs amidst
the young women peering at me completely lifted my spirits. Of
course, my nephew and his associates were only stopping by on their
way to the freshman prom, an event my own generation would have
vehemently protested. But once I pictured my nephew singing and
dancing, I relaxed and quite enjoyed the conference. In fact, I
even worked out what I thought was a very nice little exit for the
tuxedo-clad six. A woman asks towards the end of my talk, ``Where
do you think men are going?'' I answer, ``To the prom!'' Then the
boys break into a refrain from ``Varsity Drag'' and get the entire
room up singing and dancing. All that's missing is June Allyson.
</P>
<P>
   Although most likely you wouldn't cast June Allyson as a Harvard
Hillel superwoman.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the great movie musicals defined romance and American
exuberance. But while in recent, more ``edgy'' decades, these
Technicolor feasts were dismissed as kitschy, campy or just
ridiculously sentimental, a resurgence seems to be in the air. The
Lars von Trier film that won the Golden Palm at Cannes is a
musical, and so are the forthcoming films from Baz Luhrmann and the
Coen Brothers. Jerome Robbins' choreography for ``West Side Story''
has been revived as a retro-hip Gap ad. And Kenneth Branagh, the
director of ``Henry V,'' ``Much Ado About Nothing'' and ``Hamlet,''
offers a new, musicalized Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   My musical apparition featuring my nephew and company is not far
from the spirit of Branagh's version of ``Love's Labour's Lost,''
opening June 9. The three young gentlemen-scholars who take an oath
with the King of Navarre to seek the purity of intellectual pursuit
and renounce women are constantly breaking into Cole Porter, George
Gershwin and Irving Berlin standards. When the Princess of France
and her three lovely ladies-in-waiting propitiously camp out by
their Academy, the King and his court can only express their
excitement by singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I believe no situation is either so tense or so
romantic that it can't be just slightly heightened by a good
old-fashioned movie-musical number. I have always secretly hoped
that economic summit meetings erupted behind closed doors into
``Big Spender'' and that Margaret Thatcher crooned ``Begin the
Beguine'' as she told the cabinet her plans for the Falklands.
Wouldn't any commuter's trip to Darien be immeasurably enhanced by
a chorus of eager returning spouses harmonizing ``I Married an
Angel'' a cappella? Finally, the playwright Christopher Durang and
I have always thought that the tragedy ``Medea'' would be much
improved if she forgot about revenge and sang and danced, ``Forget
your troubles, c'mon get happy,'' with the Greek chorus instead.
Think Ann Miller tap dancing on a drum.
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``Love's Labour's Lost,'' I thought perhaps Branagh
shares with me a desire to musicalize even the classics simply
because movie musicals are among the top 10 reasons to live. In
fact, ``The Band Wagon,'' the movie musical by Betty Comden and
Adolph Green about the transformation of a Broadway show from a
pretentious version of ``Faust'' into a delightful musical souffle,
is definitely in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Band Wagon,'' Fred Astaire plays a Broadway
song-and-dance man who is making a comeback. He is, however,
partnered with Cyd Charisse, a formally trained ballerina. Their
relationship on stage and off is _ to say the least _ tortured,
until he takes her for a carriage ride in Central Park after a
particularly dreadful run-through. They stop at the most ideal
version of a fountain and suddenly all their artistic and personal
disputes fade away as they dance together in graceful harmony. When
they sit back in the carriage on the final note of ``Dancing in the
Dark,'' the New York skyline is shimmering behind them and all is
suddenly, romantically, perfect in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Branagh in ``Love's Labour's Lost'' seems to assume that
the majority of the movie audience is already familiar with
standards such as ``I Won't Dance,'' ``The Way You Look Tonight''
and ``Cheek to Cheek.'' In fact, many of the numbers in Branagh's
film are homages to the great Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie
musicals. However, the most striking difference between the Branagh
film and the movies it tries to emulate, according to quotations
from the choreographer Stuart Hopps in the production notes, is
that the new film is ``actor-led as opposed to dancer-led.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Cheek to Cheek'' sequence in ``Love's Labour's Lost'' has
the young scholars literally flying upward on cables as soon as the
opening lyric, ``Heaven, I'm in heaven,'' is heard. Both the words
and the musical-comedy style are being ``sent up,'' literally.
Personally, I'm still a sucker for Astaire, ascending to heaven on
his feet. Even the great ballet choreographer George Balanchine was
a Fred Astaire fan. ``The male dancer I like to watch is an
American,'' he once said, ``Fred Astaire. He is the most
interesting, the most inventive, the most elegant dancer of our
times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Love's Labour's Lost'' doesn't tip its hat only to Fred and
Ginger. There's a sly nod to every kind of movie-musical
extravaganza, from a splashy Esther Williams-style water ballet
with a bevy of bathing beauties to a rousing rendition of ``There's
No Business Like Show Business'' led by Nathan Lane, one of the few
remaining crossover film and stage musical-comedy stars.
</P>
<P>
   But except for the film's final, bittersweet ``They Can't Take
That Away From Me,'' the numbers in this musical ``Love's Labour's
Lost'' are always performed with an arched eyebrow. And when the
eyebrow becomes too arched, we can't help but suspend our
suspension of disbelief and wonder why anyone's singing to begin
with.
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   In a classic movie musical like ``Singin' in the Rain,'' Gene
Kelly is never self-conscious. He simply can't wait to get wet and
sing and dance his heart out. Even in a more ironic situation, as
when Fred sings ``The Way You Look Tonight'' to Ginger while she
has cold cream all over her face, there is a naive sweetness. Not
surprisingly, Adrian Lester, the song-and-dance man who was the
lead in Sam Mendes' London stage production of ``Company'' and who
plays the scholar Dumaine in ``Love's Labour's Lost,'' captures in
a contemporary way some of Kelly's energy and Astaire's elegance.
Still, dancing tongue-in-cheek is hardly as difficult or inspiring
as cheek-to-cheek.
</P>
<P>
   I hope Kenneth Branagh's musicalized version of ``Love's
Labour's Lost'' will introduce a new generation of moviegoers to
one of the best romantic comedies and some of the best songs ever
written. But I would wish that after all the Harvard superwomen had
seen this film, they would rush to the nearest video store to rent
the real thing. Just as you can't know the genius of Jerome
Robbins' choreography if you've only seen it in a Gap ad, you can't
know the possibilities of a filmed dance number without at least
one viewing of Fred Astaire literally dancing up the walls.
</P>
<P>
   I am still afraid I can't predict if the Harvard women will or
won't have it all. But I do know that if I'm watching Fred and
Ginger dancing in ``The Gay Divorcee,'' I have it all.

RATINGS SHOULD TELL ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to a study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, there is a surprising amount of violence in G-rated
films.
</P>
<P>
   Films such as ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' ``Toy Story''
and ``The Rugrats Movie'' contain numerous scenes of fisticuffs,
sword-fighting, gunplay and other aggressive action.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's unclear whether cartoon violence has an influence
on children's behavior, the researchers recommended that the Motion
Picture Association of America change its rating system to include
more detail on the content of G-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   I think this is a great idea, but like so many great ideas that
were not dreamed up by me personally, it does not go far enough. A
more detailed rating system is also needed for TV shows and for
movies intended for adults.
</P>
<P>
   The TV rating system in place now provides some details about
the shows but much more information is needed. It is not enough to
say that a TV-14 rated show contains intense violence (V), intense
sexual situations (S), strong coarse language (L) or intensely
suggestive dialogue (D). What we need is a system that also warns
viewers of BA (bad acting), OLT (overbearing laugh tracks), UPL
(unimaginative plot lines) and DSB (depressingly scrawny bodies).
</P>
<P>
   A show that is designated TVY7 is intended for children age 7
and older. The only additional warning that might come with a show
of this sort is the letters ``FV,'' which stand for ``fantasy
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   I suggest some additional warnings, including CA (cheap
animation), CL-S (clumsy lip-synching), ABM (annoying background
music) and, of course, NMTPANTBTGBTTC (nothing more than pictures
and noise to bridge the gaps between the toy commercials).
</P>
<P>
   Older TV shows need an upgraded rating system, too, because a
lot of their content can frighten and/or confuse viewers of all
ages. For example, the show ``Leave It To Beaver'' might come with
a MIWPAHHWD warning (mother inexplicably wears pearls and
high-heels while dusting).
</P>
<P>
   TV and movie violence itself is too vaguely described in today's
ratings systems. Words like ``moderate,'' ``intense'' or
``graphic'' are far too general and do not give the prospective
viewer nearly enough information about violent content.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest more specific designations better attuned to today's
ultra-violent action movies, such as D, D &AMP; D (decapitation,
dismemberment and disembowelment), AEMFWHB (alien emerges messily
from within human body), IPMBPDILGJ (intensely private male body
parts displayed in little glass jars) and, of course, AC (airborne
chunks).
</P>
<P>
   The danger of expanding the ratings system is that advocacy
groups of all stripes will want to get into the act. Feminists, for
example, will want to include warnings on movies like ``Snow
White'' and ``Sleeping Beauty'' pointing out SS (submissive
stereotypes) and UMPWCMS (unhealthy my-prince-will-come mindset).
</P>
<P>
   Animal-rights groups will want to warn viewers of WD (whale
demonization) in ``Pinocchio'' and HITAOBA (hippos in tutus and
other blatant anthropomorphizations) in ``Fantasia.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcoholics Anonymous and Mothers Against Drunk Driving might try
to warn viewers about the pink-elephants scene in ``Dumbo'' on the
grounds that it presents an ILHPOHIBWO (inappropriately
lighthearted portrayal of hallucinations induced by whiskey
overdose).
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Donald Duck could run afoul (afowl?) of
conservative Christian groups on the grounds that his cartoons
contain SL (suspicious lisping) and BDFP (blatant disregard for
pants).
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely possible that by the time you wade through all
the warnings you will have missed most or all of the TV show or
movie, which, come to think of it, might be the best thing for all
concerned.

   1945 War Story Reborn at Last
</P>
<P>
   During World War II it was possible to play a recorded greeting
from home, but for Sgt. Warnicki (Freddie Steele) in William
Wellman's ``Story of G.I. Joe,'' it necessitates lugging a large
Victrola all over Italy. At each pause in battle he hauls out the
carefully wrapped machine and the record his wife and child have
made for him. Each time the recording plays backward, emitting
unintelligible squawks. By the time it spins properly, he has gone
mad with battle fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the film, which opened in 1945 and at the time was
considered one of the most realistic war movies ever, might liken
Warnicki's frustration to their own at its failure to appear on
video. Last week Image Entertainment released the first tape and
DVD editions. ``It has been one of our most requested titles for at
least 15 years,'' said Irv Slifkin of Movies Unlimited, a large
video mail order company in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Where has it been? Larry Stern, president of Video-Cinema Films
Inc., a Manhattan distributor and the film's copyright owner,
described a meandering trail that goes back to 1970, when he made a
deal with Lester Cowan, the movie's producer, to place it on
television.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement lasted until 1982, with control resting solely
with the Cowan family. In 1997 the film was again licensed to
Stern, who subsequently made a deal with Image Entertainment to
release it on video. In 1972, he said in an interview, he had two
35-mm prints made. Image did the restoration work, resulting in a
fine disc and tape.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed today, ``The Story of G.I. Joe'' is something of a relic,
though unlike many of today's films it tries to be stirring without
being slathered with sloppy sentimentality. When a soldier dies, a
comrade says he'll never get a letter from Betty. Fine, someone
snarls, she'll never get one from him.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on the writings of the war correspondent Ernie
Pyle (portrayed by Burgess Meredith), who tags along with the
troops from Tunisia and Sicily to Casino and up the road to Rome.
Pyle, a Scripps-Howard reporter, was a stickler for telling it like
it was for the foot soldier. But the film never loses a certain
gentility. While the fighting is intense, the violence is implied
rather than graphic. Bodies turn up, but there is no actual
bloodshed, and it is startling to hear soldiers yell things like
``Watch it there, fella!'' instead of the threats and obscenities
in today's action films. As muddy as these troops get, they're a
clean bunch.
</P>
<P>
   The film had its beginnings during the war when the Army wanted
to counteract the rising influence of the Air Corps and Navy.
Cowan, then a young producer, was interested in making a movie
about the infantry. He was directed to Pyle, who took a personal
interest, nixing James Cagney, whom he disliked, to play himself.
He did want Arthur Miller to write the screenplay, but Miller
didn't like Cowan and withdrew. Robert Mitchum, never more
droopy-eyed, had his first starring role as Captain Walker. Pyle
was killed in the Pacific in 1944.

   After washing down a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka,
Susanna (Winona Ryder) is sent off to Claymoore psychiatric
hospital. It is the 1960s and Susanna, perhaps a little too smart
for her own good, talks about mystical undertow, but basically her
problems are a neurotic peevishness and a need to grow up. Or, as a
nurse (Whoopi Goldberg) puts it, ``You're a lazy, self-indulgent
little girl who is driving herself crazy.'' At Claymoore, Susanna
falls in with the house insurgent (Angelina Jolie) but then starts
to calm down in, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, ``a
small, intense period piece with a hardheaded tough-love
attitude.''

   In Errol Morris' documentary, subtitled ``The Rise and Fall of
Fred A. Leuchter Jr.,'' a mousy, mild-mannered Boston-born builder
of execution devices gets illusions of omniscience when his
cockeyed notions are adopted by Holocaust deniers. Sent by them to
Auschwitz in 1988, Leuchter furtively chips masonry from rooms once
used as gas chambers at Auschwitz. Finding no residue of cyanide,
he concludes that there were no gas executions at the camp. That
makes him a fixture of the neo-Nazi lecture circuit in Europe, but
here he makes creepy company in ``the best comedy-horror
documentary about the Holocaust ever made'' (Holden).

the custody of a Buddhist priest and begins a new life on a remote
stretch of coast. There he meets Keiko (Misa Shimuzu), who bears an
uncanny resemblance to his wife and awakens all the old issues of
jealousy, rage, remorse and guilt. Directed by Shohei Imamura, ``

   A loud, low-level sequel to the 1995 comedy ``Friday'' sends
Craig (Ice Cube, who wrote and produced this film) from South Los
Angeles to the suburbs, where he will presumably get a respite from
big-city violence. But out in Rancho Cucamonga all is not bucolic,
what with the gangster Joker boys flashing automatic weapons across
the street, their pit bull, Chico, assaulting the neighbors, and
Craig's cousin Day-Day (Mike Epps) battling his pregnant
girlfriend, D'Wana (Tamala Jones). In other words, don't expect
surprises in a film ``notable chiefly for feeding a stereotype of
blacks as shiftless layabouts interested mainly in recreational
drugs and irresponsible sex'' (Van Gelder).

JENNIFER CONNELLY READY TO PROVE SHE'S MORE THAN JUST A PRETTY
FACE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CONNELLY-FILMS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW MARTON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before she gives herself, body and soul, to Antonio Banderas,
Jennifer Connelly registers a series of colliding emotions with the
fluttering delicacy of a hummingbird's wings. In fractions of
seconds, her oval face sorts through feelings of indecision and
self-doubt, guilt and fear, before finally yielding to gnawing,
untrammeled desire.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad Banderas was almost the only one who got to see it.
Indeed, because the film, ``Of Love and Shadows,'' was essentially
a straight-to-video release, few witnessed what was something of an
epiphany in the career of the Brooklyn-raised actress.
</P>
<P>
   By being cast as Irene, a privileged Chilean writer fighting to
save political prisoners from her country's fascist government,
Connelly was finally freed to, well, act. For the 1994 film, she
adopted a Meryl Streep-quality Chilean accent for passionate
debates on the corrosive effects of political repression. The
debates could very well have been a metaphor for her Hollywood
career.
</P>
<P>
   That Connelly so easily traveled through ``Of Love and
Shadows''' maze of character growth was a revelation to those in
the industry who saw it. Given that, for some, she shares with
``actresses'' like Pamela Anderson Lee the voluptuous ability to
make teen-age boys drool and middle-age men gape, few mainstream
casting directors have ever considered her capable of juggling all
the facets of a complex character. But Connelly, a former Stanford
student, has set out to emphatically _ if quietly _ prove those
doubters wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long, hard road toward respectability. Connelly
started out in the business as an 11-year-old sprite striding
confidently through Sergio Leone's 1984 epic, ``Once Upon a Time in
America.'' Entranced by the performing life, she soon grew into a
series of roles that accentuated her guileless warmth while taking
advantage of her burgeoning physical beauty. By the time she was
20, she seemed primed for stardom, having shown she could be a
resourceful girl-Friday in ``The Rocketeer,'' a Saturday matinee
popcorn flick given big-time hype by Disney.
</P>
<P>
   But that was 10 years ago. Now with the recent release of the
independent film ``Waking the Dead,'' to be followed by two more
higher-profile indie movies later this year (''Requiem for a
Dream'' and ``Pollock''), Jennifer Connelly is engaged in that
toughest of Hollywood challenges. She is looking to overturn an oil
tanker-sized professional and public perception of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think she is already making much of that transition
to actress from beautiful icon,'' says Keith Gordon, Connelly's
director in ``Waking the Dead.'' ``I know that because people who
ask me about working with her have already changed their
perception.''
</P>
<P>
   But while those in the independent film game are starting to
take her seriously as an artist, the major studios _ and, by
extension, most moviegoers _ are proving more difficult to
persuade. Hollywood has always stubbornly clung to its typecasting.
And the mass popularity of the Internet, with its constantly
circulated glam stills and video clips of Connelly's acting past
(with an emphasis on the few nude scenes she's done), make it even
more difficult for her to erase that old bombshell image.
</P>
<P>
   That her ``image'' _ based squarely on her striking beauty _ is
almost entirely divorced from the actual performances she's given
hardly matters to those afflicted by it. It's a look that has
launched a thousand Web sites, from Portugal to New Jersey, some
carrying such hyperventilating names as the ``Jennifer Connelly
Worship Temple.''
</P>
<P>
   The supreme irony governing Connelly's desire to move her career
to a more ambitious place is that while her looks garnered her so
much early notoriety, they camouflaged her talent. If they were to
re-view her 10 most prominent movies over the past decade, studio
casting agents might just realize that her sensuality, often
dismissed as a Lolita-esque pose, in fact reflects a transparently
warm wellspring of feeling combined with an ineffable sense of
mystery _ the very qualities of the classic film stars of yore like
Katharine Hepburn and Greta Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Jennifer, the irony is that it is her honesty and
simplicity that achieve her great mystery and depth and that
special ethereal quality,'' says Gordon. ``We just aren't used to
seeing that kind of simplified, open-hearted honesty on screen.
Today it's more about seeing actors put on faces, put on sexiness.
But Jennifer is seductive or mysterious by not putting on seductive
or mysterious airs.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   That Connelly acts on a tantalizingly elusive level makes it
easy to see why Hollywood has cast her in so many period pieces.
She is a throwback to another time, when Hollywood's biggest female
stars wore black stockings and layers of lipstick, cavorted at
nightspots like ``The South Seas Club'' and rambunctiously lived
life on their own terms. Her restless Eleanor in ``Inventing the
Abbotts'' rebels against the starchy mores of small-town Illinois
in 1957 and revels in her carefree sexuality. Her Jenny Blake in
the Depression-era ``The Rocketeer'' is an aspiring actress with
all the gumption necessary to join the studios' star system. And
her Allison Pond in ``Mulholland Falls'' is the kind of 1940s Los
Angeles femme fatale _ complete with plunging decolletage and spine
of steely conviction _ who can take a slap and return the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Jennifer's wonderful sense of mystery, she
definitely feels timeless,'' e-mails Australian director Alex
Proyas, Connelly's director on ``Dark City.'' ``She is a beautiful
enigma and that is why she is cast in so many period or fantasy
films, because she seems unstuck from her era, ethereal and
intangible.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Connelly's ability to haunt a role can enliven the
present day too, as can be vividly evidenced in her most recent
film, ``Waking the Dead.'' As Sarah Williams, she bridges the
vibrant present and the tragic afterlife of her character by
developing her as someone grounded in the daily minutia of life
and, after death, as someone who spectrally visits those she left
behind. It is Connelly's Zen-like perspicacity, communicated with
her signature verbal economy, that allows her to be a persuasive
emissary from the beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the greatest film stars, Connelly best communicates
through her eyes. She's capable of holding a mesmerizing gaze more
meaningfully than many a present-day Oscar winner, allowing viewers
a hospitable window into a raft of roiling emotions. ``She is just
so direct; I mean, she has these green eyes that just look right
through you,'' says actor-director Ed Harris, who cast Connelly in
his upcoming biopic, ``Pollock.'' ``She has this incredibly strong
presence, and she's not afraid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a time when Hollywood is enamored with, and amply rewards,
Meg Ryan's pluck and Sandra Bullock's moxie, Jennifer Connelly's
ethereal, haunting presence gets neglected. Two of the actress's
most under-appreciated film qualities are her aura of serenity and
her dreamy equipoise, both endowing her with a labyrinthine
interior life rarely available in most cardboard film characters.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Waking the Dead'' amply illustrates, Connelly's best work
is found in small films that allow unexpected colors to emerge from
her repertory. In ``Far Harbor,'' for example, she wears no makeup,
plays most of her scenes in a formless blue sweater, and can still
command our attention simply by marveling at cloud formations from
a perch on a roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer definitely has a certain European, smoldering
complexity in her that is very grown-up and complicated,'' says
Gordon, who recalls a wrenching love scene in ``Waking the Dead''
where Connelly is making love while laughing and crying at the same
time. ``Jennifer invests that kind of sensual moment with such
great complexity that, well, you just don't normally get that in a
typical screen love scene, which is usually just about the
physical.''
</P>
<P>
   When Connelly takes on contemporary roles, she shows an uncommon
bravery in her choices. In director John Singleton's racially
overheated college campus parable, ``Higher Learning,'' Connelly
subsumes her sex appeal behind thick plaid shirts, awkward glasses
and baggy bluejeans. Plus, her social-minded campus organizer is
gay. As she tenderly kisses actress Kristy Swanson, Connelly does
it without a whiff of self-censorship or salaciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly has been attached to two upcoming independent projects
with the kind of disturbing subject matter that will serve further
to remove her from her old beautiful-ornament label. In the
upcoming ``Requiem for a Dream'' she will play a wan heroin addict,
with her normally silken, coffee-brown hair reportedly streaked a
shabby black and blond.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected out in the next six months is ``Pollock,'' with
Connelly playing the role of Ruth Kligman, the last lover of the
painter Jackson Pollock. ``I met a lot of women for this role,''
says Harris, ``Pollock's'' director and star. ``But in Jennifer I
not only found one who had the sexuality the role required but one
who also had a great intelligence and wonderful mystery to her.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a role she hopes wins her respect, even if it doesn't
secure her a higher profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very smart on Connelly's part to latch onto independent
roles,'' says Stephen Hunter, film critic for The Washington Post.
``She has discovered it is much better to be the star of an
independent film, where the roles tend to be more challenging
anyway, than to be the babe who dies in the first reel of a big
studio film.''

<P>
   Some people really know how to take the zing out of a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   With African-Americans from coast to coast and some places
across the great blue waters getting fired up for
first-of-the-century Juneteenth festivities, along comes the
American Heart Association with a bucket of cold water.
</P>
<P>
   The heart association also is talking emancipation, but not the
kind that African-Americans normally speak of every year on June
19.
</P>
<P>
   In case any of you out there in readerland suffer from the same
knowledge gap about American history that cost a ``Who Wants to be
a Millionaire'' contestant thousands of dollars several weeks ago,
Juneteenth celebrations commemorate the day that word of the
abolition of slavery reached black Texans.
</P>
<P>
   That happened on June 19, 1865, two years after Abraham Lincoln
issued the Emancipation Proclamation. Black Texans for years have
been chided about being the last to get the word about freedom.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't, of course, the fault of the freedmen. It was just
that not much of the Civil War was fought in Texas, and the slaves
were actually freed as the Union forces marched through the
Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the war was over that the northern army occupied
Texas. Then shortly after landing at Galveston, Gen. Gordon Granger
stood on the balcony of Ashton Villa and proclaimed General Order
Number 3:
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a
Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves
are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights
of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection
heretofore existing between them becomes that between an employer
and free laborer. The freedmen are advised to remain in their
present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will
not be allowed to collect at military posts, and that they will not
be supported in idleness, either there or elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the main ingredients of Juneteenth festivities has been
food, lots of it. The richest kind. The kind loaded with fat, salt
and sugar. The kind that the heart association wants
African-Americans to emancipate themselves from.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Juneteenth the African-American Outreach Task Force of
the American Heart Association encourages you to: Celebrate
Juneteenth ... Free Your Health. It is time to take our heart and
our health into our own hands,'' says a letter by the association's
Texas affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   A brochure attached to the letter calls upon African-Americans
to ``Eat for Life,'' meaning primarily that they should reduce
their intake of saturated fat and sodium and eat more fruits and
vegetables _ foods that are higher in vitamins, minerals and fiber.
</P>
<P>
   The association also recommends against smoking and heavy
drinking, while emphasizing exercise and the need for blood
pressure and diabetes checks.
</P>
<P>
   So what, you say. It points out that stroke and heart disease
are leading causes of death among African-American men and women.
In the same vein, here's some more bad news:
</P>
<P>
   _One hundred-thousand African-Americans die of cardiovascular
disease each year. The coronary heart disease death rate for
African-American women is almost 72 percent higher than for white
women.
</P>
<P>
   _The same stroke death rate comparison exists between
African-American women and white women, while the stroke death rate
for African-American men in 94 percent higher than it is for white
men.
</P>
<P>
   _High blood pressure kills African-American men at 350 times the
rate it kills white and African-American women at 315 times the
rate it takes the lives of white women.
</P>
<P>
   The heart association goes on to give information on how to
sense a heart attack or a stroke coming on and what to do. The keys
to preventing them, the association says, is to reduce, recognize
and respond.
</P>
<P>
   No one can really quarrel with the soundness of the
association's advice. But Juneteenth is one heck of time to give
it. On the other hand, what better time than Emancipation Day could
one choose to emancipate oneself from slavish eating habits that
could doom one to a premature death?

 &HT;    Team retrieves timbers from wreck believed to be Blackbeard's
flagship
 &HT;    By Amy L. Royster
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUFORT, N.C. _ Timbers from the wreck believed to be
Blackbeard's flagship waited 282 years until archaeologists lifted
them to the surface Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Through 20 feet of bottle-green water, divers raised four
deteriorated wood planks from the port side of the shipwreck to
waiting research vessels. These pieces of wood may resolve critical
mysteries surrounding Blackbeard's pirate career, including the
origin of his ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Although fall is prime excavation season, project director Mark
Wilde-Ramsing said damage done to the wreck by Hurricane Floyd made
recovering the timbers more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd left the timbers jutting through the ocean floor
vulnerable to assault by abrasive, sand-slinging currents and
wood-burowing mollusks. Project scientists covered the timbers with
sand in October 1999 but were fearful the 2000 hurricane season,
which begins today, would uncover them again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timbers could sit out another few years, but if another
Floyd comes through they would be dislodged and could be lost,''
Wilde-Ramsing said.
</P>
<P>
   Fragile compared to artifacts already recovered like cannons,
the timbers lay at the wreck site near a centralized pile of
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, divers approached the pile hand-over-hand along a
carefully staked line until the shape of a large anchor emerged
through the silty water. Encrusted in barnicles and resting on top
of a pile of ballast rocks, the anchor rose several feet off the
sandy floor. Cannons so covered with growth that their outlining
shape was nearly lost were scattered helter-skelter. Divers worked
with their masks close to the bottom trying to free the timbers
from the sand.
</P>
<P>
   The project requires a collaboration including underwater
archaeologists, geologists, technicians and interns from East
Carolina University and UNC Wilmington. Jim Craig, a professor of
geology at Virginia Tech, said the wood timbers may provide
important scientific leads that help separate historical fact from
pirate lore.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the good things about these timbers, which is even
better than the cannons already excavated, is that you can do
radio-carbon age dating and tie it into the dendrochonology
(tree-ring dating),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the age and origin of the timbers could confirm a widely
accepted theory that the ship was constructed in France.
</P>
<P>
   While timbers may provide answers to the details of Blackbeard's
travels, lead archaeologists working on the project believe the
central question of whether or not the wreck site is in fact the
Queen Anne's Revenge has been answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for 20-some years, and we've (Underwater
Archeaology Unit) investigated thousands of wrecks. I can count on
one hand the number of those wrecks that we have the same kind of
evidence as for Queen Anne's Revenge. I'm very convinced that it is
what it is,'' Wilde-Ramsing said.
</P>
<P>
   The expedition to recover the timbers comes as the N.C. General
Assembly debates next year's budget, which includes a request by
the N.C. Department of Cultural Resources for $250,000 in funding
for the Queen Anne's Revenge Shipwreck Project. The funding would
turn the project, currently manned with a temporary staff, into a
division of the Underwater Archaeology Unit, with five permanent
positions. Last year, the Cultural Resources Department gave
$100,000 to the project, but it did not receive direct funding from
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the neatest things to happen in archaeology in
the state .... In my opinion, the most basic thing is to have a
core staff paid for by the state,'' Wilde-Ramsing said.
</P>
<P>
   The shipwreck project used a grant from Greensboro's Julian
Price Foundation to salvage the timbers in a two-week project. Some
timbers were excavated on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking for a permanant staff with a very modest
operating budget to pay for basically the light bill,''
Wilde-Ramsing said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the wreck site was discovered in November 1996, artifacts
including gold dust, cannons and a bell have been recovered. While
some artifacts are on exhibit in the N.C. Maritime Museum in
Beaufort, many pieces, including the timbers, await further
examination in labs at the Institute for Marine Sciences in
Morehead City. There, in a warehouse near the waterfront, corroded
cannons lie in freshwater tanks. Throughout the warehouse, plastic
buckets hold objects yet to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the lab, Wilde-Ramsing sees years of work ahead of
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now recovery is important, exhibiting can come later,''
he said. ``If you don't get the artifacts up, you don't have
anything to exhibit.''

A FIAT WILL PLAINLY REIGN AT GREENWICH CONCOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ The star of the show at the fifth annual
Greenwich Concours d'Elegance this weekend isn't an aristocratic
Bentley or a pristine Bugatti. It's a much-traveled 1927 Fiat 509
that once hauled fish to market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Greenwich concours has a tradition of being more than just a
beauty show for cars. Each year, its founders, Bruce and Genia
Wennerstrom, look for cars that have an unusual story behind them.
He has also continued to expand the scope of the event, this year
adding classic motorboats, motorcycles and even a vintage
airplane. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The old Fiat had been owned by Ignazio Franciamore in his home
province, Agrigento, in Sicily; he used it as a taxi afterWorld War
II, then sold it in the 1950s to a man who used it for fish
deliveries. In 1987, an American collector bought the car and
brought it to Scranton, Pa. But it was shipped without antifreeze
in the motor and the engine block cracked in the Northeast winter,
rendering the car unusable.
</P>
<P>
   Franciamore's son, who shares his father's first name and
nickname (Iggy), operates a BMW dealership, F&AMP;S Motors, in the
Bronx. He heard about the old Fiat parked, fittingly, behind a
pizza restaurant in Scranton and went to look at it. Upon examining
the car's papers, he found his father's name listed as a previous
owner.
</P>
<P>
   He bought the car, restored it, and in 1998 drove it in the
Columbus Day parade in Manhattan. Both Iggy Franciamores, the
87-year-old father and his 60-year-old son, are expected to be on
hand with the car in Greenwich. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 280 automobiles are expected at the two-day event,
with different cars displayed each day. The theme for the Greenwich
Concours d'Elegance on Saturday is cars from the late 1870s to the
late 1970s, with both domestic and European cars in the pre-World
War II field and American cars only in the postwar section. On
Sunday, the Greenwich Concours Europa comprises postwar European
sports, touring and competition cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the featured cars will be a Ford GT40 Mk IV that was part
of the Ford team that defeated Ferrari at Le Mans in 1967, a 1940
Cadillac four-door convertible sedan with side-mounted spare tires,
a 1950 Buick Super wood-paneled wagon, a 1953 Ferrari 342 America,
one of only three built, and a 1929 Stutz Blackhawk boat-tailed
speedster.
</P>
<P>
   The event is open from 10 to 5 both days, with presentation of
awards beginning each day at 3 p.m. Admission is $12, with children
12 and under free if accompanied by an adult; proceeds benefit the
Americares charity. The concours takes place at Roger Sherman
Baldwin Park, 100 Arch St., in Greenwich, Conn. For further
information, call (203) 618-0460. &QL;

 &HT;    Courts have a duty to use scientific data wisely
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Right here in Texas we have two cases in the
news where DNA testing could prove beyond a shadow of a doubt guilt
or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   DNA, the building blocks of life that give every living creature
a distinct imprint, has moved from the realm of science fiction to
real life applications.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, DNA testing will hopefully close the books on the
final resting place of outlaw Jesse James. While history records
that James was shot and killed in 1882 in St. Joseph, Mo.,
residents of Granbury claim the real Jesse James faked his death,
moved to north Texas, changed his name to J. Frank Dalton and died
in 1951 at the ripe old age of 104. The DNA sample from the exhumed
body will be compared with DNA from a known James' descendant
living in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the body buried under James' name in 1882 also
was exhumed, in 1995. Scientists who examined those remains said
the body was most likely that of James.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, while the courts are eager to confirm the rather
insignificant identity of man long dead, the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals is denying DNA testing that might prevent the
execution of a man convicted of capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Nolen McGinn, scheduled to be executed for the 1993 rape
and killing of his 12-year-old stepdaughter, Stephanie Rae Flanary,
could have his death sentence commuted to life in prison if DNA
evidence proves the semen and hair samples from the murdered girl
do not match McGinn's.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who advocates DNA testing to ``erase any
doubts'' from some death penalty cases, has indicated he was
leaning toward delaying the execution for 30 days while testing
could be done.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Jesse James, aka J. Frank Dalton, DNA testing
will only prove who's buried in that grave in Texas, but for Ricky
Nolen McGinn, a life hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   If DNA can show by a reasonable doubt that McGinn is not guilty
of capital murder, then by all means take him off death row. If on
the other hand, the tests confirm the jury's sentence, he should be
put to death.
</P>
<P>
   As science unlocks more of the mysteries of DNA, it is certain
to raise ethical, moral and legal questions that were unheard of a
decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The cases of Jesse James and Ricky Nolen McGinn illustrate two
very different ways DNA testing can be utilized. It is hoped that
courts will concentrate on using this new technology to confirm
guilt or innocence rather than resolve bragging rights.

`BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE': MOMMA, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fitfully amusing ``Big Momma's House,'' starring the comic
whirligig Martin Lawrence, could best be described as ``Stakeout''
goes ghetto, with a touch of ``Tootsie'' for flava _ er, flavor.
Lawrence plays Malcolm, an FBI agent with a penchant for doing
undercover work in full body makeup, apparently to use some of the
disguises he didn't get around to in ``Blue Streak,'' his last
``Where's Martin?'' picture.
</P>
<P>
   Any fan of Lawrence's sitcom ``Martin'' knows about his skill in
using transformative appliances to convert himself into another
person with even fewer inhibitions than he displays as himself.
When he threw on padding to play Sheneneh, a homegirl-next-door
with press-on nail talons and enough hair extensions to tie a
four-mast sailboat to a dock, his immersion into this
tough-as-nails character who is all Id was shocking and funny. Here
he gets to do the same thing when he goes undercover as Big Momma,
a stubborn old Southern woman who throws elbows and knees to the
groin like a club fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Big Momma's granddaughter, Sherry (Nia Long), is on the run
because her ex-boyfriend, Lester (Terrence Howard), a murderous
bank-robber, has escaped from prison and is after her. Desperate,
Sherry calls Big Momma to seek refuge and rekindle their cold
relationship. Malcolm and his partner (Paul Giamatti) believe they
can use Sherry to get to Lester. Since the real Big Momma (Ella
Mitchell) is conveniently out of town (and stays away so long you
wonder if she is ever coming back), Malcolm seizes the opportunity
to take her place. When Lawrence conceals himself under a cubic ton
of Max Factor, you wonder where he hides his ears, which stick out
like handles on a water pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't much of a movie; it looks like a series of baseball
card shots and may have the worst rhythms ever in a film directed
by a former editor, in this case Raja Gosnell. When ``Momma'' does
come to life, it does so because of bits like a small turn by the
wide-body jet comedian Cedric ``the Entertainer,'' who plays a
raise-the-roof preacher who knows just how to awaken the inner Holy
Ghost in his parishioners. In his first appearance, Cedric sports a
high-gloss California curl and the camera seems to linger on his
coiffed head in disbelief. Later, he has sprouted an Afro with a
streak of magenta.
</P>
<P>
   In his Big Momma cover-up, which must contain enough plastic to
wrap an entire herd of beef, Lawrence brings to mind Foghorn
Leghorn in disguise; he's a bigger-than-life cartoon. In taking on
some of Big Momma's duties, like midwife _ in a tired childbirth
scene, all the onscreen characters say ``Awww'' when the baby
arrives, a grim pander to the audience _ Lawrence uses his eyes to
offer knowing complicity.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the last thing this movie needs: a wink to let the
audience know it's all make-believe. Lawrence showed more devotion
to craft in his television series. And Eddie Murphy, who has done
much the same thing in films like ``The Nutty Professor,''
certainly goes deeper into character when he puts on makeup.
Lawrence gets laughs when, as Big Momma, he leads the church in a
rendition of ``Oh Happy Day'' and jumps into dances like the Robot
and the Smurf, but if he hasn't done this stuff before, then it
certainly feels as if he has. When he is just talking to Sherry's
son, the effect is less worried and naturally funny.
</P>
<P>
   A restless actor, Lawrence is better when forced to react to his
co-stars, particularly taller ones, as he did with Tim Robbins in
``Nothing to Lose'' or Will Smith in ``Bad Boys.'' In such
situations, he can make use of his ability to parody vanity. The
able Giamatti isn't a co-star here, and his exasperation seems to
come from the fact that he is relegated to pratfalls. The alluring
Long has shown great progress as an actress this year; her work in
the feature ``Boiler Room'' and in a segment of ``If These Walls
Could Talk 2'' on HBO shows she is ready for bigger things, so
coasting on her beauty here must have been like a paid vacation.
Flittering on the periphery is Howard, who acts as if he is in a
real movie, which makes a difference. With his movie-star
concentration, in his few scenes he gives ``Big Momma's House''
weight.

STEELY DAN TAKES NEW ALBUM ON A SUMMER TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The title of Steely Dan's new album, ``Two Against
Nature,'' began as an inside joke between cofounders Donald Fagan
and Walter Becker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the idea of the two of us against encroaching
decrepitude,'' Fagan, 52, said with a smirk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really two against human nature, in the sense that your
body is telling you to slow down to a certain extent and maybe you
don't have as many ideas as you used to. Maybe you feel that you're
kind of in a kid's game and it's weird to still be doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Formed in Los Angeles in 1972, Steely Dan has been reeling
through the years with a breezy, jazz-influenced pop sound
instantly recognizable to two generations of fans. ``Reelin'
Through the Years,'' ``Rikki Don't Lose That Number,'' ``Deacon
Blues,'' ``Peg,'' ``Hey Nineteen'' and other songs are classics.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, Becker and an entourage of singers and musicians
including guitarist John Harrington are back on the road for a
summer tour supporting the new album, the duo's first studio effort
since 1980's ``Gaucho.
</P>
<P>
   With a set list featuring such new songs as ``What a Shame About
Me,'' ``Cousin Dupree'' and ``West of Hollywood,'' Steely Dan's
signature sound remains comfortably intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think `Two Against Nature' sounds like it could
have been done a couple of years after we stopped recording in the
late '70s,'' Fagan said in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter and I discussed using different recording methods and
maybe some new technology. But once we had the songs written, we
naturally defaulted to our usual way of doing things. There are
differences, but I think they're subtle.''
</P>
<P>
   Once celebrated as brilliant musical geeks, Fagan and Becker
listened to old records by Duke Ellington, Charlie ``Bird'' Parker
and other jazz legends while growing up in the 1950s and early
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think by the time we were 12, we knew what kind of music we
liked,'' Fagan said. ``And I've never really heard anything better
than that music.''
</P>
<P>
   Living in New York, Fagan often listened to all-night jazz
stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just happened that my junior high school years coincided
with the very best period for jazz of a certain kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter and I were kind of the last jazz fans of that era in
that we both started listening to jazz when we were maybe 10 or 11
years old, when not many people were interested in it anymore, at
least not on a popular level like in the '40s.''
</P>
<P>
   Named for a sex toy in William Burroughs' cult novel ``The Naked
Lunch,'' Steely Dan released its first album, the Latin-tinged
``Can't Buy a Thrill,'' to glowing reviews in 1973. The song
``Reelin' in the Years,'' featuring Elliot Randal's sizzling lead
guitar, was an immediate hit.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up in the recording studio where they left off with
``Gaucho,'' Fagan and Becker resisted the temptation to reinvent
themselves musically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like some of the things I've heard lately. But I know that
if we went in and remixed `Two Against Nature,' people would
complain that we were trying to be trendy, just by changing the
echo on the snare drum or something,'' Fagan said.
</P>
<P>
   The duo also has resisted working with younger artists, a la
Carlos Santana on his blockbuster Grammy-winning album
``Supernatural,'' in order to reach younger listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to collaborate with youth, but we're not very good
at it,'' Fagan said. ``We tend to run them over with a steamroller.
They don't really appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Santana's recent success may have given Steely Dan's new album a
little boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been told that it may have helped us, in the sense that
you don't have to be 16 and have a lot of tattoos to get on the
radio,'' Fagan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't really know. We've never really thought that much
about radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan and Becker worked together on songs, coming up with
wonderfully impressionistic lyrics. On ``Almost Gothic,'' Fagan
sings, ``She's pure science with a splash of black cat/ She's
almost gothic and I like it like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, fans snickered over ``Hey Nineteen,'' about a
romance between a young woman and an older man. On ``Two Against
Nature,'' the duo updates the theme with ``Janie Runaway,'' in
which an older male dreams of a girl ``who makes me feel like
painting again'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's plan a weekend alone together/ Drive out to Binky's
place/ The Sugar Shack in Pennsylvania/ Or would that be a federal
case?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as you get older, you find yourself getting into a
routine,'' Fagan said. ``But I don't see why you have to stop
appreciating beauty. I see a lot of guys who are sort of afraid to
look at girls now that they're in their 40s and 50s. To me it's the
most fun.''

   The Art of Cool in a Hot Spot
</P>
<P>
   It was a very warm day in Brooklyn, and an even warmer day
inside the house where the director Bob Gosse was shooting ``Julie
Johnson,'' an independent feature that stars Lili Taylor, Courtney
Love and Spalding Gray.
</P>
<P>
   With the windows shrouded with heavy black cloth to simulate
night, and about 20 crew members and a dozen extras crammed into a
hallway, a kitchen and a dining room, the temperature had soared
well beyond sauna standards.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gosse, a founding partner of the Shooting Gallery, a
production company, and the director of the 1997 film ``Niagara,
Niagara,'' was keeping amazingly cool behind the camera. The
objective was a complicated tracking shot that followed Donna
Hanover, playing the dutiful academic wife to Gray's physics
professor, as she opened the door for Taylor and Love, and ushered
them into a cocktail party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do it again, but better'' was Gosse's half-joking direction as
take followed take, each one spoiled by a missed cue or an
overstepped mark. But neither Gosse nor his performers betrayed the
slightest hint of discomfort. Sometimes acting is knowing how not
to sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julie Johnson,'' adapted from a play by Wendy Hammond, is the
story of a Hoboken housewife, played by Taylor, whose life changes
radically when she decides to enroll in a night school class,
``Introduction to Computers.'' ``When Lili's character announces,
`I don't want to be stupid no more,' it kicks off an unraveling
that becomes the narrative arc of the picture,'' Gosse said. Not
only does Julie discover that she has a genius for advanced
mathematics, but also that she's been living a lie. She kicks out
her domineering husband and takes up instead with her best friend,
Claire ( Love).
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up on the West Coast with hippies,'' Love said, ``where
if people were gay, they were gay. No big deal. But then a couple
of years ago, when I started getting projected more into the
mainstream and having to deal with mainstream American values and
not really understanding it, I started to meet people who weren't
out, who weren't resolved with it, and that's the majority of
people who live in this country. And I started to have a lot more
compassion for the fact that they can't come out, because it's not
that easy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a Wynona Judd show,'' added Love, best known as the
leader of the rock band Hole. ``And she's like married, not a gay
person at all. But I went to the show, and there were so many women
there I just thought, OK, this is like the big gay fest for women.
I felt this vibe of not-straightness in the room, and yet everybody
seemed to have wedding rings and children. Right after that, I read
this script.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's whip smart,'' said Gosse of Love, ``and she's brought an
intelligence to Claire that wasn't apparent in the screenplay. It
would be easy to read this script and see Claire in a condescending
way, but I didn't want to condescend to either of these women.''
</P>
<P>
   For Taylor, too, it was important to avoid the big-hair,
pink-sweater, rhinestone-glasses cliches that define New Jersey in
so many movies and television shows. ``I see Julie as basically
asleep, and then the tension builds and she breaks. This story
reminds me of the fairy tale called `The Handless Maiden,' and for
a while I imagined her without hands, as someone incomplete.''
</P>
<P>
   When she approaches a role, Taylor said, ``I try to be as blank
as possible, and then by reading the script over and over, by the
sixth time through things start seeping in, maybe by osmosis. First
I have to know what's going on inside the character. I'm more of an
inside-out than an outside-in. Some actors work great outside-in,
but I feel like I'm wearing a suit and it doesn't quite fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find with a good script that I can break the character down
into four or five general phases. I usually name each phase, and I
write out all the beats in between on a chart. It's especially
useful on independents, when it's all over the place and you're
moving so quick. Let's say I have seven scenes in one day and I've
got to go from phase to phase, so I just look at my little chart
and I'm right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Love has her own approach. ``I've been working with the clothes,
trying to get it right but totally getting it wrong. I was in the
lobby of my hotel and I saw Sofia Coppola and Spike Jonze, and it
was the day before the shooting started. I sat down with them and I
had a coffee and they both were like, a hundred bucks you can't get
through this movie without wearing something cool. I came to work
the first day, and I said I'm not wearing one cool thing. Nothing
cool is coming out of me! I'm really finding her that way. It's
good to strip down and not be cool. And I'm gonna win that hundred
dollars.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The March of Verite
</P>
<P>
   With ``Cinema Verite: Defining the Moment,'' the Canadian
filmmaker Peter Wintonick has created the ``That's Entertainment''
of documentaries _ an all-star tribute, generously illustrated with
clips and interviews, to the 1960s movement that changed the face
of nonfiction filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the lightweight cameras and sound-recording equipment
developed in the '50s, directors like Richard Leacock and Robert
Drew (``Primary''), Albert and David Maysles (``Salesman''), D.A.
Pennebaker (``Don't Look Back''), Michel Brault (``Les Ordres'')
and Frederick Wiseman (``Titicut Follies'') discarded the studied
compositions and rhetorical flourishes of the dominant ``March of
Time'' style in favor of a more casual, more intimate, less overtly
manipulated manner that created a powerful impression of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``That style is still being used in its purest form by many
practitioners,'' Wintonick said, ``but it's also influenced a lot
of audio-visual language, from the Danish Dogma movement to music
videos. It's a technique that has great resonance still because it
has direct human, dramatic content.''

   ``Who's Jennifer Connelly?'' you ask. Rent the following movies
and not only will you know who she is, you'll be petitioning Oscar
voters on her behalf _ or at the least downloading her picture from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Labyrinth'' (1986) _ Here, Connelly is barely into her teens
yet already her mystical, otherworldly quality begins to establish
itself. Watch her hold her own opposite glam-rocker David Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hot Spot'' (1990) _ A Dennis Hopper-directed film noir
where Connelly forms a triangle of intrigue with Don Johnson and
Virginia Madsen. Notable for Connelly's sweet portrayal of a chaste
yet yearningly romantic accountant torn by a terrible secret.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Of Love and Shadows'' (1994) _ Perhaps her most complete role,
Connelly wears a Spanish-inflected accent very comfortably as a
Chilean writer willing to risk her life to expose a repressive
government.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulholland Falls'' (1996) _ Connelly isn't around for long in
this Los Angeles-based potboiler but she is at her high gloss best
as a tall drink of pulchritude in heels and a black dress with
plunging neckline who drives Nick Nolte to adultery and murder.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventing the Abbotts'' _ (1997) One of the last of Connelly's
``bad girl'' films. Her Eleanor Abbott wants to escape the yoke of
her domineering father, and she does it through a steamy
relationship with someone from the wrong end of the social
register. That someone is Billy Crudup's Jacey, and he is a good
match for the sexually adventuresome Eleanor.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark City'' _ (1998) Somehow Connelly manages to register
great range in this sci-fi, ``end of days'' phantasmagoria. At
first, she's a heavy-lidded torch singer cut from the Jessica
Rabbit mold. Later, she's a guilt-ridden wife coping with a
dizzying series of surreal events. Finally, she is a welcome ray of
sunshine on a once-bleak urbanscape.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking the Dead'' _ (1999) Connelly has distilled all the
political activist residue from the late '60s and poured it into a
more cynical early 1970s landscape. She is warm, passionate,
forthright, righteous, romantic _ in short an adorable and,
sometimes, exasperating spitfire. She also is a blithe otherworldy
spirit, literally haunting her boyfriend, Billy Crudup, in his
second successful pairing with Connelly.

   This melancholy Dane is son of the deceased chairman of Denmark

rise dotted with omnipresent surveillance cameras, his kingdom's
streets lined with paparazzi and tabloid reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Like Baz Luhrmann's vibrant ``Romeo + Juliet,'' set in a modern
Miami of mob families and gang bangers, Michael Almereyda's
``Hamlet'' preserves the language (admittedly pared and pruned) in
a modern setting, a vision in glass and steel.
</P>
<P>
   The cold blue and gray palette at times sucks the energy from
the film along with the color _ even at under two hours it
sometimes slogs along in low gear _ but Almereyda refreshes a text
that has threatened to become a cultural cliche.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlet (Ethan Hawke) is a college film student home for his
father's funeral who is emotionally blindsided by his mother's
sudden remarriage. His uncle/stepfather Claudius (a smooth, smarmy
Kyle Maclachlan) is a manipulative corporate pirate and his mother
Gertrude (Diane Venora) is too distracted to hear Hamlet's anger
and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   It's a warped mirror of the family of loyal Polonius (a fussy
but tenderly sincere Bill Murray in a lovely performance) and his
warm, concerned relationship with his children Laertes (Liev
Schreiber) and Ophelia (Julia Styles).
</P>
<P>
   Almereyda's tragedy is not the vile murder of Hamlet's father
(whose restless ghost is stately played by Sam Shepard) but the
cycle of violence it perpetuates. As a smoldering, vengeful Hamlet
kills the rot of his own family tree he takes the orchard with him.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke broods well but emotes only passably as Hamlet, wrapping
himself in a sullen, alienated shell, but it's refreshing to see a
Hamlet who really acts like a grieving, messed up young adult
tortured by indecision and insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   An outsider in his own dysfunctional family, he hides behind an
ever present video camera, shielding his bottled-up grief while
watching the drama of his family play out from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be or not to be'' is contemplated in the aisles of a
Blockbuster, but his suicidal musings appear in direct address to
his camera, a diary-like confession that carries all the more power
for its intimacy and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Almereyda's modern transpositions are more precious than
prescient _ the ghost fades into a Pepsi machine, USA Today
headlines comment on the struggle over Denmark Corporation, budding
director Hamlet creates a rather obtuse experimental film to test
his uncle's reactions _ but his overall take is resonant and his
dramatic choices are often startlingly good.
</P>
<P>
   Ophelia's tortured demise has never been more poignant and
Gertrude's climactic death is transformed into a piercing maternal
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Almereyda has pared away the text but he saves the language and
the drama from the musty, reverent faithfulness of Franco
Zeffirelli's stiff 1990 version with Mel Gibson and Kenneth
Branagh's four-hour 1996 adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh, vibrant and vital, this interpretation reminds us why
Shakespeare is timeless. The scenery changes and the setting moves,
but his stories and concerns are eternal.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlet. Directed by Michael Almereyda. Screenplay by Almereyda
from the Shakespeare's play. Cast: Ethan Hawke, Kyle MacLachlan,
Diane Venora, Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles, Bill Murray, Sam
Shepard. Miramax. 112 minutes. R for some violence.

With intensive practice in using the paralyzed limb, people can
literally rewire parts of their brains, researchers said, and
overcome a kind of learned helplessness that prevented their limbs

 &HT;    A titillating look at gay life in '50s
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An awkward mix of gee-whiz nostalgia and full-frontal
titillation, ``Beefcake'' attempts to be several movies at once. It
may have plenty of nudity, but dramatically speaking, there are
more condiments here than beef.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Thom Fitzgerald (``The Hanging Garden'') takes
us to the hep-talkin', big-daddio world of 1950s Hollywood. It's a
candy-colored place where handsome, wide-eyed wannabes could find
themselves ushered into a poolside wonderland of well-muscled men
wearing nothing but teeny-tiny posing pouches. And, sometimes, not
even that.
</P>
<P>
   The newest arrival as ``Beefcake'' begins is played by Josh
Peace, whose character's name, in a nod to ``Valley of the Dolls,''
sets the tone: Neil O'Hara. He's welcomed into the circle of Bob
Mizer (Daniel MacIvor), a shutterbug whose Athletic Model Guild is
responsible for turning out ``physical culture'' books and films.
His oeuvre consists of oiled, half-naked fellows frolicking with a
mock innocence that only underscores their tableaux's blatant
homoeroticism. ``So who watches these films, anyway?'' asks Neil,
oblivious to the fact that, in the closeted world of the '50s, this
is pre-Stonewall pornography for gay men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beefcake's'' faux-naif tone switches bluntly when it
re-creates the court trial of Mizer, charged with running a male
prostitution ring. In case we miss the point, Fitzgerald shoots
these scenes in black and white. The movie is also peppered with
interviews from actual models or leaders of the big-beauty-boy
culture, including Jack LaLanne and Joe D'Allesandro (the
model-actor who went on to let it all hang out in several Andy
Warhol flicks).
</P>
<P>
   The movie's blend of camp, talking heads and nudie naughtiness
is always engaging, but it never adds up to a coherent whole. By
the final (and amusing) credits, you'll appreciate the wiggy,
make-believe world that Mizer and his ilk created to circumvent the
moral codes of the time. And you can understand why Fitzgerald
wanted to explore the territory. But you might be justified in
feeling that ``Beefcake'' is sometimes just as cheerfully
exploitative as the Mizer movies of yore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beefcake''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Daniel MacIvor and Josh Peace. Unrated, but contains
simulated sex and lots of nudity.1 hour, 36 minutes.

homoeroticism, 1950s-style.

 &HT;    Sex Pistols: Vicious, rotten punks revisited
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their season of discontent was absurdly brief _ 26 months. Yet
they resonated throughout the world in a way that few bands ever
have, before or since.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' are the 1970s British punk rockers the Sex Pistols
(Johnny Rotten, Sid Vicious, Paul Cook and Steve Jones), who
managed to turn out one album and survive (barely) one U.S. tour
before imploding. But their impact, as the sensational documentary
``The Filth and the Fury'' points out, was such that they
``achieved notoriety in 19 languages.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Julien Temple examines this notoriety with an ardent,
cutting-edge artfulness that expertly captures The Way It Was when
four young men with nasty attitudes could knock a nation on its
ear. Temple, whose style is a shrewd mixture of MTV fast cuts and
mid-'70s outrageousness, knows the Pistols made a lot of music
(some of it pretty bad) and made a lot of headlines. Most of all,
however, they made a commotion. They shook people up. As Rotten,
aka John Lydon, says, ``This band wasn't about making people happy.
It was about attack. Attack, attack, attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the public attacked back. Rotten literally feared for
his life when he went out. (Rightly so; he was once slashed on the
streets by a razor-wielding nonfan.) So did the music industry.
When the Pistols' ``God Save the Queen'' made it to the top of the
Billboard chart, the line on that chart was left blank.
</P>
<P>
   Temple first profiled the Pistols in a 1980 documentary called
``The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle,'' which told their story mostly
from the point of view of their dandyish manager, Malcolm McLaren.
He insisted that the Pistols were his creation, sort of his
personal performance-art project. The new film lets the band
members have their say, in which they often contradict McLaren and
sometimes one another. In a gesture that verges on gallantry,
however, Temple keeps them shrouded in shadows. We never see Johnny
Rotten at fortysomething. He remains frozen in the '70s, a raging,
charismatic punk Peter Pan.
</P>
<P>
   Sid Vicious, aka John Ritchie, remains frozen in the '70s as
well. That's because, after allegedly stabbing his junkie
girlfriend, Nancy Spungen, to death in the Chelsea Hotel, he died
of a heroin overdose. Still, thanks to the earlier film and some
recently discovered early footage, Vicious appears _ in interviews,
in performance and, finally, in the sad final phase of his
self-destructive addiction, nodding off on camera or stumbling
around the stage like the walking dead.
</P>
<P>
   The walking dead is pretty much how Rotten saw _ and still sees
_England circa 1976, when the Pistols were born. Temple underscores
this view with a crafty use of clips, ranging from Laurence Olivier
as ``Richard III'' (his refrain, ``deformed, unfinished,'' was one
of Rotten's influences) and bits by ghastly/jolly English comics of
the era to shots of riots in the street while the posh set go on
with their tea and crumpets as if the Empire still stood.
</P>
<P>
   The picture's title is taken from a tabloid headline after a
particularly rowdy appearance on the BBC. The band is stoned; but
then, so is their host. In fact, that's one of the fascinations of
this film. Twenty-five years later, the Pistols, with their torn
shirts and safety-pin accessories, look more ``normal'' than the
absurd wide-tied, blow-dried TV pundits who interview them. The
idea that they were competing on the charts with the likes of the
Bee Gees or Kansas or, heaven help us, leftover David Cassidy, is
an astonishing juxtaposition.
</P>
<P>
   The film has a few problems. First, it's a bit like a typical
Rotten song: repetitive. We get the point; we get the point; we get
...
</P>
<P>
   Second, unless you are exceptionally well-versed in the punk
scene chronology, you may have some trouble telling what happened
when. That Vicious started out as a fan and was a late addition to
the group comes as a real surprise to some of us. Temple never
quite lets us know when the transition was made.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, unless you've a very good ear for voices, you may not
know who's saying what. Still, it's generally clear when the
endlessly quotable Rotten is speaking. He says the band was ``a bit
like a Harold Pinter play _ it shouldn't work but it does.'' And
pondering the Vicious-Spungen tragedy, he notes, ``I could take on
England, but I couldn't take on one heroin addict.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but take on England they did. The Sex Pistols may not have
been the best band ever, but as a cultural phenomenon they were,
well, phenomenal. This movie reminds us what a short, strange trip
it's been, taking us through a spit-smeared looking glass to a time
so close and yet so very far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Filth and the Fury''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   A documentary. Rated R for profanity, sexual content and drug
use. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   45 minutes.
</P>

   The verdict: The Sex Pistols rampage again! Nostalgia with an
attitude.

 &HT;    Martin Lawrence large and in charge as `Big Momma'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Big Momma's House'' is one super-sized Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   As an FBI agent on a neighborhood stakeout to capture a vicious
bank robber, Lawrence dons layer upon layer of prosthetics to
impersonate a 325-pound, small-town granny in Cartersville (the
movie, however, was filmed in Los Angeles). The results may be
predictable, but with Lawrence's manic comedic timing they are also
occasionally quite funny.
</P>
<P>
   Part ``Witness,'' part ``Mrs. Doubtfire,'' ``Big Momma'' is
mostly a series of sight gags (Big Momma in a tent dress pouring on
the grease in a cast-iron skillet to cook up burned pork chops,
squeezed into tights to join a kung fu class, meshed with a triple
X-sized jersey to help a little boy on an outdoor basketball court
and prove to a couple of young bullies that granny's got game).
</P>
<P>
   At its most inspired, ``Big Momma'' goes to church with Lawrence
donning leopard-spotted gloves, an enormous white suit, heels and
hat to witness to a receptive congregation (Oscar winner Greg
Cannom did the star's makeup). ``I have lusted in my heart,''
Lawrence's granny meekly says, ``in my living room, in a hot tub
and in the back of an El Camino.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in all of this is a story. It involves an on-the-lam
Sherry (Nia Long), suspected of helping the bank robber. She's fled
the big city with her young son to take refuge at Big Momma's
house. Big Momma is the grandmother she hasn't seen in years and,
naturally, Lawrence falls hard for her.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the plot is your standard-issue drag show plus
one, big, inexplicable out-of-nowhere boo scare, ``Big Momma'' does
briefly reach for something more. At least twice, Lawrence's macho
agent morphs into a more fully realized woman (in one instance,
lecturing an aging _ and overly aggressive _ suitor in how to woo a
woman and loudly proclaiming, ``I am not street booty''). It hints
at the kind of moments that made Dustin Hoffman's ``Tootsie'' and
Jack Lemmon's ``Some Like It Hot'' truly remarkable movies.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Big Momma'' is indeed Lawrence's gig. Most of the
supporting cast simply hover on screen. As the bank robber Lester,
the able actor Terrence Howard (``The Best Man'') has virtually
nothing to do but look sinister.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's ``Big Momma,'' however, lives large. It's a small
film with one hefty impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Momma's House''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence and Nia Long. Rated PG-13 for crude
humor including sexual innuendo and for profanity and violence. 1
hour, 39 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Predictable plot but plenty of laughs.

ALMEREYDA TURNED TO OLIVIER TO GUIDE HIM THROUGH `HAMLET' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Michael Almereyda's big business ``Hamlet'' is firmly
set in the high tech world of modern New York but for inspiration
he looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Olivier was a great guide,'' says Almereyda, referring
to Sir Laurence Olivier's 1948 British production, still considered
by many as the finest screen adaptation of the play. ``Olivier
slashed it. He's held up as the one to beat but he cut out
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, he cut out Fortenbras.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He cut out `Oh what a rogue,' '' chimes in Ethan Hawke,
Almereyda's young Hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He allowed the text to breathe,'' continues Almereyda,
``partly by cutting it and partly by introducing interludes where
the camera just prowls around the castle. He focused very sharply
on things he had absolute conviction in. Instead being intimidated
by Olivier's or anyone else's version, we just wanted to do the
best we could on our own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Almereyda and Hawke use the possessive ``we'' to include the
collaboration of their rich cast, which includes veteran performers
(Sam Shepard and Kyle Maclachlan), young stars (Julie Styles and
Steve Zahn), funnyman Bill Murray in a serious role (``He had never
died in a movie before,'' notes Almereyda, who can now lay claim as
the man who first killed Bill Murray), and two performers who have
portrayed the melancholy Dane themselves on stage _ Liev Schreiber
and Diane Venora.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way of showing that you love something is to be able to
include a sense of play,'' the director says. ``Everyone involved
in the project was there because they wanted to work with
Shakespeare, they wanted to say those words. It's like wanting to
sing a song, but we wanted to do it our own way and make it as
immediate and urgent and true to ourselves as we could make it and
hope that other people would share those feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet'' is in many ways the ultimate role for an actor, which
may explain why so many cinematic incarnations have been, shall we
say, a little more mature than the written role suggests _ he is,
after all, a student returning from college (``the perpetual grad
student,'' quips Almereyda). Hawke is the youngest actor to tackle
the role in a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt when I read it that it was a young man's
part, that it was the emotional life of a young man,'' Hawke
confesses. ``There's this great Holden Caulfield line (from
``Catcher in the Rye'') about seeing Laurence Olivier play Hamlet,
which is that he wasn't as phony as all the rest of the actors but
he still played Hamlet more like a general than the pathetic guy he
had imagined him to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Their ``Hamlet'' may take place in the skyscrapers and city
streets of a steel and glass New York City, but the words are
distinctly Shakespeare's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a conceit, of course. All the way through, they're
speaking heightened language, but I wanted it to be more felt, to
seem more internal and not blustery,'' says Almereyda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare was an actor and very aware on a fundamental level
that civilization is made up of people acting all the time, acting
as fathers, acting as lovers. We're playing roles all the time, and
in `Hamlet' almost every character has a role to play and they have
a mask that they very consciously wear.''

Vladimir Putin of Russia will do the United States a great service
when he sits down with President Clinton this weekend and refuses
to modify the Antiballistic Missile Treaty to allow the United
States to deploy a limited missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Why does Russian opposition work in America's interest?
</P>
<P>
   We are still in the early stages of a serious debate over a
national defense system against missile attacks and, more broadly,
over our nuclear strategy in the new century. Without a consensus
on these important points, it is simply wrong to cut a deal with
Moscow, either now or in the remaining months of the Clinton
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, of course, does not see it that way.
Clinton does not want to be the first president in decades to fail
to sign a significant arms control agreement with the Russians.
When the summit meeting was announced several weeks ago, officials
hoped to make an arms-control agreement its centerpiece, and saw
reasons for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Putin pushed the long-delayed ratification of the
second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as START II, through
the Russian Parliament. The Clinton administration took this as a
sign that he was prepared to deal.
</P>
<P>
   American officials were also encouraged that Sergei Ivanov,
director of Russia's national security council and a close Putin
confidant, had not flatly opposed amending the ABM treaty, which
bans missile defense systems, during a visit to Washington in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent discussions, however, have shattered the
administration's optimism, and it has since tried to lower
expectations. Last week, Samuel Berger, the White House national
security adviser, stated that he did not expect arms control issues
to be resolved this weekend. Rather, he said, the summit would be
``a good opportunity for us to explain our view of the problem, and
for President Putin to express his view of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration still hopes to cut a deal before Clinton
leaves office, but that remains wishful thinking. The Russians have
little incentive to negotiate. The debate in the United States over
the reliability of the missile-defense technology, and the scope of
the system we should build, is growing. Our European allies are
becoming more concerned, and China is adamantly opposed to missile
defense systems. This only encourages Putin to stand his ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are also concerned that an American missile defense
could eventually undermine the effectiveness of their own nuclear
arsenal, arguably their last remaining claim to great power status.
The problem is not the limited system the Clinton administration
wants to deploy against the threat of missile attacks from North
Korea. The Russians know that the White House's proposed system
would pose no defense against their arsenal. But over the next
decade, as the technology improves, they fear that without the ABM
treaty's controls, a more effective system could be built.
</P>
<P>
   Also worrying the Russians are their economic constraints, which
will force them to reduce their nuclear arsenal _ as weapons can no
longer be maintained or replaced _ to below 1,500, regardless of
what the United States does. The last thing they can afford is a
new high-tech arms race.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome Moscow's resistance, the Clinton administration
could be tempted to sweeten the pot further in its last months by
promising to reduce the capabilities of a national defense system.
That would be the wrong approach at this time.
</P>
<P>
   As Gov. George W. Bush and others have noted, there is a new
world out there: the nuclear equation has changed radically. The
challenge has expanded beyond maintaining stability between two
nuclear-armed superpowers. Arsenals in Russia and the United States
may be reduced, but others, notably in China, will increase.
Nuclear-weapons and ballistic-missile technology will almost
inevitably continue to spread to rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   While it would be folly to lightly discard the strategic arms
treaties that have maintained stability for the last 30 years, it
would be equal folly not to reassess these treaties in light of the
changes over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, we do not need a quick decision on whether
to deploy a national missile defense system. Instead, we need to
forge a domestic consensus about anything we might build, and we
must persuade our allies in Europe and East Asia to endorse
whatever path we choose. Yes, we should be talking all along to the
Russians to assess their views and reactions. But until we have
done our work at home and with our allies, we should be wary of
signing any treaty with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Logically, only the next administration can conclude this
debate. And that is why, if events unfold as expected, Americans
should be prepared to thank Vladimir Putin for looking out for
their interests by saying no to Clinton on missile defense.

`HOW TO READ AND WHY': LITERATURE'S GREATEST HITS _ INSTRUCTIONS
FOR USERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not so long ago, it would have seemed preposterous for a serious
scholar to bother writing a book titled ``How to Read and Why,''
but in our digital, image-driven age, the eminent teacher and
critic Harold Bloom apparently feels it is necessary to reiterate
the reasons why we read. The resulting book, like so many of the
author's recent works, is a hodgepodge of erudite analysis,
familiar arguments, pompous grandstanding and lengthy digressions;
it might well have been subtitled ``My Favorite Books and Why I
Like Them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the reasons Bloom gives for reading will be obvious to
anyone who loves books: that we read to ``enlarge life,'' to enter
an ``alternate reality,'' to be ``liberated into perspectives not
previously available'' to us. We read for knowledge _ of the world,
of others and of ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why read?'' Bloom asks. ``Because you can know, intimately,
only a very few people, and perhaps you never know them at all.
After reading `The Magic Mountain' you know Hans Castorp
thoroughly, and he is greatly worth knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other reasons that Bloom offers for reading are less persuasive,
couched, as they are, in the utilitarian _ and for this author
unlikely _ language of a self-help manual. We read, he writes, ``to
strengthen the self, and to learn its authentic interests.'' Poems,
he contends, ``can help us to speak to ourselves more clearly and
more fully, and to overhear that speaking,'' while novels can treat
the ``dark inertia, the sickness-unto-death'' we experience in
daily life. ``Our despair requires consolation,'' he adds, ``and
the medicine of a profound narration.''
</P>
<P>
   Though such observations on the how and whys of reading are
supposedly this book's raison d'etre, they actually feel like
afterthoughts, grafted onto a meandering discussion of works of
literature Bloom admires. Among others, he talks about short
stories by Turgenev, Chekhov, Hemingway and Calvino; poems by
Tennyson, Dickinson, Wordsworth and Keats; novels by Austen,
Dickens, Proust and Mann; and plays by Shakespeare, Ibsen and
Wilde. Bloom, who is Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale
University and Berg Professor of English at New York University,
explicates such authors' works as if he were lecturing to a class,
setting forth his prodigiously learned but often arbitrary
judgments with sweeping grandiosity.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in his 1994 magnum opus, ``The Western Canon,'' Bloom
demonstrates his taste in these pages for categorizing literary
works and ranking them in strict hierarchies. He declares that
modern short stories are either Chekhovian or Borgesian, the first
gratifying ``our hunger for reality,'' the second teaching us ``how
ravenous we still are for what is beyond supposed reality.'' He
asserts that ``Don Quixote'' is the best of all novels, and that
Cormac McCarthy's ``Blood Meridian'' is ``the strongest imaginative
work by any living American writer.''
</P>
<P>
   As for human nature, he suggests that all people _ not to
mention all literary characters _ can be divided into four types:
Hamlets, Falstaffs, Don Quixotes or Sancho Panzas.
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``The Anxiety of Influence'' (1973), Bloom is
perhaps best known for his Freudian theory of poetic influence,
which suggests that writers are shaped by their Oedipal struggle to
free themselves from the legacy of their literary forefathers, and
this volume underscores what a fierce hold this theory still exerts
over his critical imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``How to Read and Why'' often reads like a complicated
genealogical chart, with virtually every writer eventually tracing
his lineage back to Shakespeare, Bloom's all-time hero and the
subject of his last book, ``Shakespeare: The Invention of the
Human.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently it's not only Dostoyevsky who took character-writing
lessons from Shakespeare, but Chekhov, too; and Chekhov, in turn,
Bloom argues, was ``the major influence upon all story writers
after him.'' Novelists who write about characters who change _ that
is, characters who evolve in the course of the story _ also owe a
debt to Shakespeare, Bloom contends; included in this group, he
says, are writers like Austen, Goethe, Stendhal, Philip Roth and
Cormac McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   In another chapter, Bloom points out Melville's considerable
debts to Shakespeare, comparing Ahab to the likes of King Lear and
Macbeth, and he goes on to argue that writers as disparate as
Faulkner, Nathanael West, Thomas Pynchon, Ralph Ellison and Toni
Morrison ``are Melville's children.''
</P>
<P>
   Though this sort of genealogical analysis can illuminate certain
writers' evolution, it can also obscure genuine differences in
their voices and their visions, and the ways they have been shaped
by the cultural zeitgeist of their day.
</P>
<P>
   In this volume, Bloom is so obsessive on the subject that he
sees influence everywhere he looks _ never mind whether that
influence is so vague as to seem illusory, or whether it actually
sheds light on a writer's work.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that Hemingway ``is most Shakespearean'' when he
``is most ambitious in his stories,'' as in the case of the
quasi-autobiographical ``Snows of Kilimanjaro.'' He insists that
``Turgenev is one of the most Shakespearean of writers in that he
too refrains from moral judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   And he argues that Coleridge's ``Rime of the Ancient Mariner''
is ``Shakespearean in its detachment of tone.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems with this book as well. Many of Bloom's
assessments of individual writers and larger cultural developments
are debatable at best.
</P>
<P>
   He highhandedly declares that ``literary parody expired'' with
Nathanael West. And he contends that contemporary culture suffers
from a ``loss of irony,'' rather than a surfeit.
</P>
<P>
   More alarmingly, he repeatedly asserts that writers like Milton
and Wallace Stevens ``require mediation'' if the lay reader is to
understand them. There is the suggestion in such remarks that there
is only one way to read such writers, and that most people need
someone like Harold Bloom to tell them how to do it. Such an
outlook manages to be patronizing and self-congratulatory all at
the same time. &QL;

NEWS OF THE GREAT WHITE WAY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Big Women and `Little Women'
</P>
<P>
   Even as Sunday's Tony Awards signal the end of one season,
another slate of shows is wheeling into sight, whether you're ready
or not.
</P>
<P>
   First comes news of the return of a celebrated one-woman play
whose star has been absent from the Broadway stage for nearly 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   It is Jane Wagner's ``Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in
the Universe,'' a panoramic look at a group of radicals, corporate
tools and homeless visionaries, all inhabiting the body and mind of
Lily Tomlin.
</P>
<P>
   The show was a critical and popular hit in 1985 and subsequently
toured extensively. Tomlin won a Tony for her performance and soon
became a film star.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is returning to Broadway, having dusted off the piece
last summer during a long American tour. ``Search'' is to open on
Nov. 16 after playing at the Seattle Repertory Theater and the
McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J. The plan is for a 10-week run
at a Shubert theater, possibly the Booth.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlin said the impetus came after she and Wagner showed a short
portion of ``Search'' to students in a workshop at the University
of Southern California. ``The kids had never seen it,'' Tomlin said
in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. ``And they just
responded.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening date, however, may sound awfully familiar to the
producers of ``Little Women,'' the musical adaptation of the Louisa
May Alcott novel. The piece, being produced by Randall L. Wreghitt
(``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'') and Dani Davis, had a reading in
April. That was followed in short order by the dismissal of the
original songwriting team.
</P>
<P>
   In their place are Mindi Dickstein, a lyricist whose most recent
stage credits include versions of the children's stories ``Black
Beauty'' and ``Little Red Riding Hood,'' and the composer Jason
Howland, a protege of Frank Wildhorn. Howland had been a producer
on it.
</P>
<P>
   That hiccup aside, ``Little Women'' still plans a Sept. 27
opening in Boston and a Nov. 16 opening at the Ambassador Theater
on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for both shows said they were confident that their
dates were solid, but someone will probably make way because
producers are loathe to share their big night. Luckily for them,
they have six months _ and the entire Tony telecast _ to sort
things out.
</P>
<P>
   Return of Vidal
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than two months since producers began to talk
about a revival of ``The Best Man,'' Gore Vidal's 1960 satire set
in the hothouse environs of a presidential campaign. But now the
project appears to be moving ahead with a surprising cast.
</P>
<P>
   No contracts have been signed, but Jeffrey Richards, one of its
producers, says that Spalding Gray, the acclaimed monologuist, has
agreed to appear, alongside Charles Durning and Elizabeth Ashley.
Gray would play William Russell, an upstanding presidential
candidate with a secret or three, while Durning would be the ailing
President Hockstader. Ashley would play Gammage, the coy national
committee chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   An agent privy to the negotiations said Kyle MacLachlan had also
been approached, but Richards would not confirm that. Ethan
McSweeney (``Never the Sinner'') will direct.
</P>
<P>
   Vidal, never shy to opine, said he was extremely pleased with
the casting if not with the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no problem casting 40 years ago unless you wanted
Marilyn Monroe,'' he said, speaking from Ravello, Italy, where he
lives. ``Today, the actors might still be available, but these
agents in Hollywood would rather have their client play a small
role in a western to be shot on speculation in Tucson rather than
put him in `Hamlet' on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes ahead, Vidal would come back to the States to see
his opening. The show is expected to arrive on Broadway in
September and run through the general election, probably closing
right before the inauguration in January. That timing would also be
felicitous for Vidal; his latest history, ``The Golden Age,'' about
World War II, is to be published by Doubleday in September. And on
Oct. 4 he turns 75.
</P>
<P>
   How does he feel his examination of 1950s politics fares in the
current political climate?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that you or anyone would notice is there's no
mention of money,'' Vidal said. ``No hard money or soft money.
Nobody talks about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't plan to update it to fit today's cash-dominated
scene. ``The audience is going to be transported to the days of
Dick Nixon and Jack Kennedy,'' he said. ``You're going to see what
we took for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Eviction of a Legend
</P>
<P>
   Think of Stella Adler, and one almost instantly imagines the
fervent early years of American theater, when Stanislavsky was
king, matinee tickets were $1 and theaters were grand. But now the
acting school that bears that legendary actress' name is in danger
of becoming homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The Stella Adler Conservatory, which Adler founded in 1949 and
taught at until her death in 1992, has been at 419 Lafayette St. in
the East Village for a decade, just down the block from the Public
Theater. But this year the conservatory was told it would be
evicted when its lease expires next summer.
</P>
<P>
   While that is over a year away, the school needs to raise $1.5
million to guarantee a new home. Tom Oppenheim, the conservatory's
artistic director and Adler's grandson, said the timing _ during an
inflated real estate market _ could not be worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at a space at 26th Street and 11th Avenue last year,
which was $15 per square foot,'' Oppenheim said. ``Now its $40 per
square foot.''
</P>
<P>
   To raise the money, Oppenheim has turned to foundations and past
students. The school lists luminaries like Marlon Brando, Warren
Beatty and Harvey Keitel as alumni.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a positive aspect to all of this,'' Oppenheim
said, ``it's that it connects us to alumni and the theater
community.''

SUMMER-SHARE CITIZENSHIP?

 c.2000 The New York Times 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Summer residents from the Hamptons to the Rockies
are raising their voices in protest over being required to pay high
taxes in their vacation getaways while being denied the right to
vote in local elections.
</P>
<P>
   These second-home owners, including many who are superrich, are
quick to evoke the Boston Tea Party motto _ no taxation without
representation. They should reread their history; there they will
discover a rather different lesson.
</P>
<P>
   The good people of Boston were full-time residents of their
communities. What they objected to were controls imposed on their
lives by outsiders _ those who were not members of their
communities, those who did not share their lives. An analogous
situation today would be if the United Nations were to impose taxes
on New Yorkers and dictate how much money should be spent on roads
leading to the airports, as opposed to schools.
</P>
<P>
   In vacation or weekend communities, however, it is the
year-round residents who are the true heirs of the Boston rebels;
they fear that the summer outsiders, with little interest in
supporting many local services, would use their votes to direct tax
revenue and public policies in ways that conflicted with the
community's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the locals ask rather little of summer visitors: they
need only declare themselves permanent residents, and they can vote
as they wish. They will also be relieved to discover that
``permanent residency'' does not necessarily entail suffering the
indignity of living year-round in some boondock like Southampton or
Edgartown.
</P>
<P>
   Making the summer place one's official home often means simply
giving up the right to vote somewhere else, though some communities
and states require minimum residency periods.
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason summer residents may not wish to push
their taxation-without-representation argument too far: the right
to vote, in New York, as in the rest of the country, is based not
on paying taxes but on being a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners who work or invest in New York (or for that matter,
any other place in the United States) must pay taxes there. If
these taxpaying aliens were all accorded the right to vote, they
might well prefer candidates who would raise the taxes on the
superrich to levels common in many other countries, make
inheritance taxes stick, or expand the welfare state. They might
even vote to introduce national health insurance!
</P>
<P>
   From the days of the ancient Greeks, citizenship has entailed
much more than coughing up taxes or casting a ballot; it has meant
being a member of the community. It was never just about rights,
but also about responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a community may be willing, within limits, to support
measures that are good for the whole, even if they do not
immediately or directly serve their own self-interest. They may be
willing to support schools even if all their children have
graduated.
</P>
<P>
   And in some cases they are willing to limit development to allow
future generations to have some piece of nature left to enjoy,
among all the mansions. (Admittedly, it is also true that once they
have their own paradise, rich outsiders become preservationists and
try to block local businessmen from building anything else.)
</P>
<P>
   The full-time resident cares about cultural markers like a
statue of a whaler in front of the courthouse or a gigantic
American flag, about the upkeep of the cemetery where the
community's elders are buried, and about access to the beach for
all the town's residents.
</P>
<P>
   The outsiders' argument that they feel unfairly treated ignores
the costs they impose on the locals. Trips that take a few minutes
during the winter on Cape Cod can turn into grueling hours in the
summer. Stores, where one can visit with friends on snowy
afternoons, become mobbed once the days grow longer. And the price
of buying a larger home or one for the children is increasingly out
of reach.
</P>
<P>
   A community's culture and tradition are threatened, too, by
people with different values and tastes, who do not care that
Starbucks has driven out the neighborhood diner or that a Mercedes
showroom has replaced the local used-truck dealership.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, not all the summer people are superrich, and some
locals no longer remember what a farmer or fisherman looks like.
Still, the outsiders tend to disrupt whatever local culture _
whether artistic or intellectual or merely laid back _ has evolved.
And they do not stick around to form a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice!'' cry the summer residents. It is a concept they
should be leery of trumpeting. There is more to justice than merely
a legal right to cast a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to be a socialist or even a liberal to wonder if
those who make millions on Wall Street have an inalienable right to
impose their lifestyles on places they basically just visit, to
uproot communities of farmers and blue-collar workers simply to
make room for a second or third residence.
</P>
<P>
   If they truly care about life in these communities, all they
have to do is to make these communities their true home.

describing a proposed strategy for Al Gore to help a longtime
friend and Democratic fund-raiser obtain a $400 million federal
contract. The document's origin is unknown, and Gore says he knows
nothing about it and never intervened. The undated three-paragraph
memo _ unaddressed and unsigned _ suggests that ``Gore has called
or is ready to call'' then-General Services Administration chief
Roger Johnson in an attempt to help developer Franklin Haney lease
a planned office building, the Portals, to the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   AND MAY IT GO BETTER THAN SOME OF THOSE OTHER `WARS'
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, speaking at Emory University Medical Center in Atlanta
today, promised to lead ``a war'' on cancer and offered a proposal
to speed Medicare coverage for preventive screenings that the human
genome research project promises. He also called for measures to
keep medical records private and to ban employment and health
insurance discrimination against workers who find through genetic
testing that they are predisposed to disease.
</P>
<P>
   COOPERATION OVER CONFLICT
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush proposed tax incentives for private conservation
efforts and more money for federal programs to promote preservation
instead of simply placing land off-limits by federal order.
Standing on the shores of Lake Tahoe in Nevada, Bush criticized the
Clinton-Gore administration, which he said has steadily increased
the government's grasp on forests, monument properties and
seashores. Saying ``this Washington-centered mindset'' breeds
resentment and conflict, Bush said it's time to build conservation
partnerships among the federal and state governments, local
communities and private landowners.
</P>
<P>
   HOLDING HIS FEET TO THE CAMPFIRE
</P>
<P>
   In a close presidential race, Al Gore can't afford to lose any
traditionally Democratic voting sector. However, on securing the
votes of environmentalists, Gore has been paddling in rough waters.
Over the years, he's worked hard on his environmental resume,
written a book ``Earth in the Balance,'' drawn attention to global
warming and been pictured hiking and canoeing in the wilderness.
But some enviros are bitterly disappointed in his record under
President Clinton, and Gore's environmental allies worry that Green
Party candidate Ralph Nader will siphon off votes.
</P>
<P>
   BLOWING SMOKE ON JOB LOSSES?
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by a handful of angry tobacco workers in Macon, Ga.,
who said they feel the federal government is trying to eliminate
their jobs, Al Gore said he doesn't want to make cigarettes illegal
and would do what he could to protect tobacco-industry jobs _ so
long as it doesn't undercut efforts to keep kids from smoking. ``I
am happy to do anything I can to help you preserve your livelihood,
but I am not going to say or do anything that in any way undermines
or weakens the toughest possible measures to prevent children from
ever getting into the habit of smoking. Now if that costs me votes,
I'm willing to pay that price,''
</P>
<P>
   KEYES `FINE' _ AS A NO. 2
</P>
<P>
   Constitution Party candidate Howard Phillips told reporters that
he thinks Alan Keyes ``would be a fine running mate''for his party
if Keyes left the Republican Party. Phillips: ``I have invited
(Keyes) to join our ticket, although it is my intention to remain
as presidential candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   THE HILLARY AMBITION TOUR? . . .
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio launched one of his most stinging attacks yet against
Hillary Clinton, asking whether his Senate rival's campaign is
``about ambition, or is this about public service?'' Lazio said New
Yorkers should ask candidates: ``What have you done for us for the
last eight years? Have you been in our corner, or are you just a
Johnny-come-lately who is aspiring to a position?'' He also told
reporters: ``This is a struggle between somebody on the far left
and somebody in the center.'' What makes Clinton a far-leftist? Her
unsuccessful attempt to overhaul the nation's health care system,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   . . . OR THE NEW YORK STATE OF MIND
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton took an aggressively combative tone against her
new Senate opponent, criticizing Rick Lazio for operating what she
said was a campaign based on insults and asserting that her
positions better reflected the views of mainstream New Yorkers.
``While my opponent tells you where he's from, I'm going to tell
you what I'm for,'' Clinton said at the lower Manhattan
headquarters of the carpenters union. ``This is not about who's
from New York; this is about who will fight the right fights for
all New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   HOME LOAN BEEF TOSSED OUT
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission dismissed a complaint against
Hillary Clinton over an arrangement for a home loan. The
Conservative Campaign Fund alleged in September that the first lady
and Terry McAuliffe, a friend and one of President Clinton's chief
fund-raisers, violated federal election law when McAuliffe agreed
to co-sign for the Clintons' $1.7 million home in Westchester
County _ in effect, providing a huge campaign contribution.
Criticism of the arrangement led the Clintons to finance the
five-bedroom house themselves.
</P>
<P>
   THE VICTIM TRAP
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio has a good chance to defeat Hillary Clinton ``if he
doesn't treat her as a victim,'' said George W. Bush. His comment
was picked up by an open mike during a break while taping a Chris
Matthews ``Hardball'' show on MSNBC. Bush to Matthews: ``I think he
is going to win if he doesn't make a mistake, if he doesn't treat
her as a victim.'' Clinton's popularity soared in public opinion
polls as a result of her husband's impeachment battle with
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   THIS IS YOUR LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Besides trying to spotlight Al Gore's personal side by mixing
slices of his biography into policy addresses, the Democratic
National Commitee plans to spend at least $20 million for ads
focusing on Gore's life. In a first step toward launching the ad
campaign in the next couple of weeks, party officials have asked
about the availability of TV time in at least a dozen states.
Officials in both parties say the states include Michigan,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Mexico, Iowa, West Virginia and Gore's
homestate of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   GOING WITH THE MAN IN MISSOURI
</P>
<P>
   Eyeing an open seat in the House, top Republicans are wading
forcefully into a contested primary as the party picks a candidate
to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Pat Danner of Missouri. Speaker
Dennis Hastert reportedly intends to campaign for state Sen. Sam
Graves. That will come as a disappointment to Kansas City Council
member Teresa Loar. ``I haven't heard from (party leaders), but
I've heard from a number of sources that they prefer a white
conservative male to a moderate female,'' she told the Associated
Press. Danner is undergoing treatment for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   THE VEEP GLASS CEILING
</P>
<P>
   The cheering, foot-stamping and tears lasted for eight minutes
after Geraldine Ferraro accepted the Democratic nomination for vice
president in 1988, the first woman to be nominated by a major
party.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years later, both major party candidates say they are
considering women for the No. 2 spot. But despite gains made by
women elsewhere in politics, most observers figure the chances for
a female veep this year are slim. ``It's ironic that women voters
are such a key target group and yet there is so little talk about a
woman for V.P.,'' said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
   SURPRISE _ MONEY'S THE ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the New Jersey race for Democratic Senate
nomination, the issues largely were the tax increases that cost Jim
Florio re-election as governor in 1993, Social Security and health
insurance. But now, with only days to go before the primary, Jon
Corzine's record-shattering $33 million campaign spending spree is
the biggest issue, transforming the ex-Wall Street investment
banker from unknown to favorite in a matter of months. Florio has
spent only $2 million on his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL ACCESS _ AT A PRICE
</P>
<P>
   An association of county governments, partially funded by local
taxpayer dollars, contributed $20,000 each to the Democratic and
Republican parties to help get the ears of elected officials in
Washington. The five-figure ``soft money'' donations allow
officials of the National Association of Counties to attend
contributor-only luncheons, briefings and other congressional
events. ``Participating in these two groups gives us access to
leadership on both sides ... additional access that we may not
have,'' said association spokesman Tom Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   E-MAIL WARS OF ENDLESS WORDS
</P>
<P>
   Presidential campaigns have always whispered nasty little
nothings about the opposition into reporters' ears. But just as
e-mail has ushered in a new era of communication ease and
connectedness for the world at large, it also has created a
hyper-efficient form of press release, a paperless document that
not only links the political world to the nation's assignment
editors, columnists and news anchors in seconds, but also allows
the campaigns to fire at each other at will, all day long. As a
result, a presidential campaign is no longer so much a series of
stops as an endless wave.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG PUNISHMENT GOING TO A VOTE
</P>
<P>
   A measure that would send nonviolent drug offenders for drug
treatment instead of to jail has qualified for California's
November ballot. The measure would require those convicted of
possession to receive treatment and probation. Anyone convicted of
selling or making drugs would be excluded, as would those with a
record of violent crimes. Passage is estimated to save taxpayers up
to $150 million in annual prison operation costs and up to $575
million in prison construction costs. The ballot initiative was
backed by billionaire George Soros. It is opposed by police and
prison guards.
</P>
<P>
   SO GET TOGETHER, TALK ABOUT IT
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two Senate Democrats jumped into the debate over Social
Security, writing to George W. Bush for more details on his
proposal to create individual investment accounts ``so that the
American public, elected officials and other policy-makers can
evaluate your proposal. ... The public needs the full details of
any proposals,'' the Democrats wrote. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer
said Bush welcomed bipartisan input and supported a proposal by a
bipartisan group of senators to have a commission study changes to
the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   17 DOWN, 33 TO GO
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader is now on the ballot in 17 states, according to CNN.
``We expect to be on 40 states by the end of June, and we're going
for all 50 by the end of summer,'' Nader said in an interview. The
Christian Science Monitor said Nader's bid ``is attracting enough
liberal support in key states to make life difficult for Al Gore
this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   AS CLOSE TO A PHOTO OP AS HE'LL GET
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader, with head down and shoulders stooped and clutching
his trademark stuffed brown folder, appeared oblivious to the crowd
calling to him on his way to a recent campaign appearance in New
Haven, Conn. ``Nader, remarkably devoid of charisma despite nearly
40 years in the public eye, wasn't interested in introducing
himself to the others,'' the Boston Globe said.

`HARLAN COUNTY WAR' AND `SEX IN THE CITY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, Holly Hunter is a remarkable actor, but who would have
guessed she could do a dead-on impersonation of Jimmy Stewart?
Well, she can. It comes in a pivotal scene in ``Harlan County
War,'' when Hunter's character, Ruby Kincaid, whose husband and
father are striking coal miners, tries to persuade a group of women
to join their men on the picket line. She has Stewart nailed, right
down to those tongue-tied pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched scabs take my men's jobs,'' she says. ``They'd ah,
dah dah, they've been treating us like this since I's a little
girl. Yub yub yub, I'm gettin' sick to death of bein' pushed
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Ruby succeeds in convincing the other women. And yes, the
downtrodden miners ultimately succeed in their bitter fight with
the mine owners. But Hunter, luminous as she is, cannot succeed in
fleshing out this cardboard morality tale.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which Showtime is offering on Sunday night, is fiction
set inside the wrenching 13-month miners' strike in Kentucky that
was the subject of the Oscar-winning 1976 documentary ``Harlan
County, U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as you meet Ruby, you know she is one of nature's
noblewomen. She lives in a sad little company-owned shack with her
working-stiff husband, Silas (Ted Levine); her widowed daddy, Tug
Jones (Wayne Robson), a victim of black lung; and two angelic
children. She cooks, she sews, she hauls water (no indoor
plumbing), and she says, ``Nothin' ever bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in the mine are hellish, but when a union organizer,
Warren Jakopovich (Stellan Skarsgard) shows up, Ruby isn't
impressed. She tells him, ``You cain't ever change the way things
is done here.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren, a former miner born in Poland (as good a cover as any
for Skarsgard's Swedish accent), proves to be noble, too. Under his
guidance the miners call a strike, and a long standoff follows.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby begins to warm to the idea of the union, especially after
her daddy gives her one of the film's too many too-pat speeches:
``We been coal miners in this family since way back yonder. Pretty
good life. Get a contract, it'll be better.''
</P>
<P>
   She volunteers her pluck for the cause, becoming Warren's ally
and even accompanying him to New York to confront the president of
the mine's parent company at a shareholders' meeting, where she
delivers another Stewartesque oration. Scenes like this are meant
to tug at your heart, as the bluegrass-tinged score makes clear.
The banjo signals happy turns; the fiddle, sad ones.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best efforts of the other actors, Hunter may as well
be in a one-women show here. There is no sexual tension, or human
engagement of any kind, between Warren and Ruby. Her moments with
Silas, even an explicit lovemaking scene, have no heat. Their
marriage is tested a bit by the strike and Ruby's newfound
independence, but matters are neatly resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby's most fully realized encounter is with the fancy bathtub
in her New York hotel room. Her unvarnished wonder at the luxurious
plumbing is memorable, but the moment feels like an exercise from
acting class.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter looks wonderful in her simple cotton dresses, even if her
upper arms seem to have been sculptured by lifting weights, not
tubs of laundry. But strong as she is, she cannot lift this film,
written by Peter Silverman and directed by Tony Bill as more civics
lesson than drama. Nor can she breathe life into the down-home
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   When Ruby tells a slimy mine executive why her husband chose to
strike, she says: ``That's why God give us tongues. If it don't
taste right, spit it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe change the channel.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Comb your hair, Junior. Those four randy bachelorettes are back,
looking for love in all the wrong places. As ``Sex and the City''
begins its third season on HBO, Sunday night at 9, fragile Carrie
(Sarah Jessica Parker) is still trying to get over her breakup with
Big. Uncertain Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is still on again, off again
with dogged Steve (David Eigenberg). Perky Charlotte (Kristin
Davis) still can't get her hands on the man of her dreams while
insatiable Samantha (Kim Cattrall) can't keep her hands off one
nightmare guy after another.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's episode opens with the four women standing, ``Titanic''
style, on the prow of a Staten Island ferry. Carrie is on her way
to judge a firefighters' beefcake contest and her friends are along
to ogle. Samantha finds a fireman to smolder with while Carrie
fends off the advances of a politician, Bill Kelly (John Slattery).
``He's way too I'm-the-guy,'' Carrie says. But before long she's
thinking about playing I'm-the-girl with him. Bill will be back in
the next episode, when Carrie hits the campaign trail and wonders
if there can be sex without politics.
</P>
<P>
   This series earns the adjective adult, both for its frank
presentation of its subject matter and its sophisticated look at
the childishness of grown-ups. Its four stars continue to work
together seamlessly. They keep their characters just this side of
caricature and they keep their viewers wondering how a half-hour
can zip by so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Do women this adorable really travel in hungry packs around New
York?
</P>
<P>
   Dream on, Junior.

 c.2000 Cindy Pearlman  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angelina Jolie lives on the edge. Forget planning. Forget the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always right in the moment,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the moment dictated that the screen beauty dye
her hair a color best described as ``grandmother blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, her advisors went berserk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told, `You know, Angelina, people are taking you
seriously now. You've got to take yourself seriously,''' Jolie
says, mimicking the voice of a Hollywood agent.
</P>
<P>
   She sighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are suddenly concerned about my hair?'' she says.
``Please. I was like, `I don't think we fooled anyone.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Jolie delights in making waves. This is a woman
who literally jumped into a swimming pool in her ball gown after
winning a Golden Globe Award for ``Gia'' (1998). She isn't adorned
with jewels but with tattoos, including a large ``H'' which stands
for Haven, her brother's middle name.
</P>
<P>
   Recently she took a plunge of a different sort by marrying actor
Billy Bob Thornton. No one even knew that the two actors, who met
on the set of ``Pushing Tin'' (1998), were dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' Jolie says, ``when I'm 90, they will never be able to
say, `Oh, she was just another boring starlet.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement. Even her clothes come with that Jolie
twist. She isn't wearing DKNY or Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try Wal-Mart,'' she jokes, allowing those ridiculously puffy
lips to burst into a smile. ``Hey, it was the only thing that was
clean. I don't have time to go to the cleaners.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds reasonable. After all, her career is in overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie stars opposite Nicolas Cage and Delroy Lindo in ``Gone in
60 Seconds,'' opening June 9. It's the story of a contest between
two rival gangs of car thieves, vying to prove which group can
``collect'' the most merchandise in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do the film because it was high art,'' Jolie says.
``It was my summer vacation last year, and frankly I wanted to
learn about cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know how to steal a car now, although maybe I shouldn't
get that out there,'' she says. ``We actually had a real thief on
the set, escorted by his prison guard. I didn't know who they were
the first time. I thought they were two prop guys and then I got
the skinny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the thief a million questions,'' she says, ``and this
guy could rip apart an entire car and tell you every single part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After two serious films _ ``The Bone Collector'' (1999) and
``Girl, Interrupted'' (1999), which earned her a Best Supporting
Actress Oscar as a deranged mental patient _ she was ready for some
screen fun. But Jolie is quick to say that she's still a serious
actress.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that's why she turned down the upcoming big-screen
version of ``Charlie's Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Charlie's Angels' people had a few selling points,''
Jolie says. ``They told me there weren't many good characters for
strong women. But I countered that I've been able to play strong
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was also told that doing `Charlie's Angels' `will make you a
big star,''' she says, ``which is frightening and not a plus in my
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at it as a money job,'' she concludes. ``Given the
fact that I don't really like to get dressed up in high heels, it
wasn't worth it to me. I figured that my fun job was `Gone in 60
Seconds.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And, frankly, I thought car thieves and hanging out with the
boys was just so much cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie, who is the daughter of actor Jon Voight and actress
Marcheline Bertrand, says she isn't overly impressed with her
newfound stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I have the same acting abilities,'' she says. ``It's not
like I'm suddenly a better actress because I have awards or this
box-office clout. It's just that now I'm on more covers of
magazines. It's easier to hire me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't take my successes personally,'' Jolie adds.
``I still think I'm someone who got very lucky. I'm someone who
people took a chance on, a few years ago when I was no one in this
town. And now? I don't think I'm so important _ I'm just an actress
for hire.''
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean that she has any problems with her
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am secure in the fact that I do have something to offer as
an actress,'' Jolie says. ``I've done justice to my roles. I've
always felt that I was the best person to do the roles that I've
been offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, I still won't take a role unless I think I am the
best person to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite role to date was, predictably, her Oscar-winning
turn in ``Girl, Interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved that movie,'' she says. ``I got to fling the windows
open and just breathe and scream. It felt so good. I got to push
buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite characters are those who, like the mental patient
Lisa in ``Girl, Interrupted,'' face internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a side of me that understands conflicted emotions,''
Jolie says. ``For instance, when I'm intense I might be crying, but
a whole other side of me is angry that I'm crying _ you know, if
I'm soft, I hate myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do self-pity,'' the actress says. ``I want to scream,
`I am not weak!' I'm one of those people who need to learn to let
somebody hug me. I need to learn to need other people.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It has been called ``Star Trek's'' evil twin.
 &HT;    In the sci-fi series ``Lexx,'' there are no final frontiersmen
selflessly rescuing alien kittens from trees. Along the darkly
humorous edge of ``Lexx,'' lust bubbles and life is cheap.
 &HT;    As science fiction, it's something different. As television,
``Lexx'' is downright bizarre. ``Lexx'' is a siren of distinction
for its black comedy, skewed take on the human condition and open
sexuality, qualities that act as counterpoints to contemporary
sci-fi sensibilities, according to Lex Gigeroff, co-writer of the
show, along with Jeffrey Hirschfield _ who also voices the show's
lust-struck robot, 790 _ and executive producer Paul Donovan.
 &HT;    Perhaps some of its unique style comes from the fact that the
series is filmed in a remote area of Canada _ Halifax, Nova Scotia.
And the people behind the show are all dedicated to taking a
low-key, unassuming approach to the genre.
 &HT;    ``Science fiction has a tendency sometimes to be very pompous
about itself,'' Gigeroff says, speaking from the Halifax office of
Salter Street Films, which co-produces ``Lexx'' with Germany's Time
Film und TV Produktion.
 &HT;    ``We're really dealing with weighty issues here,'' he adds,
``but there's all sorts of ways of doing that. You can do that in a
heavy-handed way or in a bit more of an ironic or off-center way,
and I think that's the trick, trying to find the outside edge of
science fiction.''
 &HT;    Gigeroff realizes that ``Lexx'' is not the first show to walk
sci-fi's fringes, beginning with the landmark ``The Prisoner''
(1967), which starred Patrick McGoohan.
 &HT;    ``There were things like `The Prisoner,' which was certainly
dark at times,'' he says, ``and also things like `Dark Star,' John
Carpenter's dark 1974 space comedy.''
 &HT;    ``Lexx'' debuted in 1996 as four made-for-television movies
called ``Lexx: The Dark Zone Stories,'' now called season one. The
movies came two years after Paul Donovan's 1994 movie ``Paint
Cans,'' which featured Gigeroff and Canadian actor Michael McManus,
who plays ``Lexx's'' undead assassin, Kai.
 &HT;    Two years later, ``Lexx'' returned as a 13-part series, then
returned again this spring with 13 new segments. ``Lexx'' is most
popular in the United States, Canada, Britain, France and Germany.
Yet fans exist even farther abroad: Linked to ``Lexx's'' Web site
(www.Lexx.com) are a few sites in Russia.
 &HT;    On the simplest level, ``Lexx'' is the story of three space
outcasts _ Kai, Stanley Tweedle (Brian Downey) and Xev (Xenia
Seeburg) _ wandering space in a cybernetically enhanced insect
spacecraft, the Lexx.
 &HT;    ``It's a show that's not really connected to Earth in any way,''
Gigeroff says. ``They are not colonists from Earth ... So it kind
of gives you a lot of freedom, a really tremendous latitude to go
for it.''
 &HT;    That latitude resulted in a change to this season's story
structure. While season two was a series of stand-alone episodes,
this year is a narrative centered around an interplanetary war.
 &HT;    ``Paul really liked the idea of being able to take a bit more
time with some stories,'' Gigeroff says.
 &HT;    ``It's sometimes a challenge to create a wholly self-contained
little universe each week,'' he adds. ``You can take a bit of time
with some characters, which is what we tried to do with Nigel,''
meaning Nigel Bennett, the Emmy Award-winning Canadian actor cast
as season three's recurring character, Prince.
 &HT;    Another change involved Seeburg. Introduced during season two as
a replacement for German actress Eva Haberman, who played Xev's
progenitor, Zev, in the ``Lexx'' movies, Seeburg first appeared as
a savvy, red-haired love slave. The change to Seeburg's natural
blond tresses resulted during production this season, once Seeburg
was sure that fans had accepted her as Haberman's replacement.
 &HT;    ``People would see me like I look in real life, even the people
that I worked with, and they would always go, `Oh, Xenia, it's so
good to see you without that horrible red wig,''' Seeburg says from
her home in Dusseldorf, Germany. ``So finally it was like an
all-around agreement.''
 &HT;    A constant of the show has been its stunning digital effects,
created by Filmeffekte GMBH in Germany and CAGE Digital in Halifax.
Yet the effects, too, have evolved: This season was shot using
high-definition technology that was blended with digital imagery,
then treated on video for a film effect.
 &HT;    Perhaps the only thing that hasn't changed is the knack of the
cowardly captain, Stanley Tweedle, for routinely finding himself in
life-and-death situations.
 &HT;    ``We really think it's one of our missions in life to put Brian
Downey in as many uncomfortable shooting positions as possible,
just because he's such a great guy,'' Gigeroff jokes. ``Paul and I
will be talking about what we're doing, and Brian will come by and
ask, `What are you going to put me in next week?' And he does it
cheerfully.''
 &HT;    He's pleased that ``Lexx'' has won a fan base, but Gigeroff says
the producers never aimed for mass appeal.
 &HT;    ``We've always kind of wanted to try and get a little cult
show,'' he says. ``This is never going to be a show which everybody
is going to like. It was never meant to be.''
 &HT;    Some of the show's guest stars have been cult icons in their own
rights. Malcolm McDowell, who played an ultraviolent ``droogie'' in
``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), has appeared. So have Rutger Hauer,
who was the tragic antagonist Roy Batty in ``Blade Runner'' (1982),
and Tim Curry, still best known as just a sweet transvestite in
``The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' (1975).
 &HT;    As for the future, Gigeroff refuses to speculate. Given the
precarious nature of television, he says, he's content for the
moment with what he calls ``an incredible rocket ride so far.''

 (Includes a color slide of rock star Don Henley.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 c.2000 Gary Graff  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1984, Don Henley _ the once and future singer/drummer
for the Eagles _ lamented in song that there was ``Not Enough Love
in the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, on his first solo album of all-new material in 11 years,
Henley informs us that ``I'm very, very happy/And I know that's not
what you'd expect from me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley isn't kidding. He's been married since 1995 to Sharon
Summerall, a fellow Texan with whom he moved from California to a
home outside Dallas, where they're raising three children. He has
found a life's calling outside music in the Walden Woods Project,
an environmental-preservation organization. And this year he and
his Eagles partner Glenn Frey are being inducted into the
Songwriter's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the spirit of bonhomie saturates Henley's new
album, ``Inside Job.'' There are still plenty of pointed social and
political commentaries amid the 13 tracks, but they're balanced by
songs that celebrate the happy state of his home life, including
``Nobody Else in the World But You,'' ``Taking You Home,''
``Everything is Different Now,'' ``My Thanksgiving'' and
``Annabel,'' a lullaby for his oldest daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has certainly had an inspirational effect,'' the
52-year-old Henley says. ``At the risk of sounding like I've been
in some sort of self-help program _ which I haven't _ I've
rediscovered my better self. I feel in my mind and in my heart like
I did when I was in my early 20s, when I was in college _ and I'm
not drunk or high!''
</P>
<P>
   Henley is quick to add that he's always considered himself an
optimist, and he felt that as a songwriter his mission was to point
out that things could be better. But he also acknowledges that the
sweet tenor of ``Inside Job'' will catch off-guard those who are
used to the sharp tone of past hits such as ``Dirty Laundry,''
``Sunset Grill,'' ``All She Wants to Do is Dance'' and the
Grammy-winning ``The End of the Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has crossed my mind that it might not be very well received
or it might even be ridiculed in some quarters,'' says Henley, who
moved to Los Angeles in 1970 with his band, Shiloh, before joining
Linda Ronstadt's band and subsequently forming the Eagles in 1971.
``But you know, I don't (care) anymore. This woman and these
children have helped me to rediscover myself, and I don't mind
putting that out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a very liberating thing for me,'' he adds. ``I've
gotten so much strength and courage from my family that I can
afford to be totally open and honest about how I feel. If people
like it, great. And if they don't, that's great, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley has not run out of dragons to slay, however. ``Workin'
It,'' the first single from ``Inside Job,'' offers Henley's take on
the current state of American society. ``They're Not Here, They're
Not Coming'' pokes fun at UFO disciples, while ``Damn It, Rose''
was inspired by a friend's suicide and deals with what Henley calls
``empty rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   But while that kind of song used to dominate his albums and seep
into his other material, Henley feels that the fire doesn't burn
within him in quite the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can always go home to the children and to the wife, and the
world goes away for a little while,'' Henley says. ``That gives me
the strength and the serenity to live with those things. But, yes,
it has heightened my awareness and, yes, it has made me more angry.
But I think that's balanced, because my life is more balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley _ who left his former label, Geffen, to move to Warner
Bros. Records for ``Inside Job'' _ does have a new battle to wage.
He and some other artists, including his former backup singer
Sheryl Crow, Billy Joel, Bonnie Raitt and Hole's Courtney Love,
have joined forces to fight the music industry and Congress over
what the musicians feel are actions that are being taken to strip
them of their rights to their own work.
</P>
<P>
   Henley explains that the 1976 Copyright Act provided for the
full return of an artist's work to that artist after 35 years. But
the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the
record companies, has quietly inserted an amendment _ tagged onto
an unrelated bill _ that reclassified recordings as work for hire,
which allows the labels to own them forever.
</P>
<P>
   This is part of the ``greedfest'' that has followed the recent
spate of entertainment-industry mergers, Henley says, and he feels
that ``it's just the first shot across the bow from the record
company. I think they're going to keep on trying to ... cheat
artists out of the rights to their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley expects the amendment to be passed into law, and is
frustrated at what he sees as other artists' lack of willingness to
lend their voices to the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists have managed to get organized for all other causes _
for the rain forest, for the environment in general, for
anti-nukes, for cures for cancer, for the homeless, for hunger ...
all manner of charity work we've done,'' Henley says. ``But we've
never been able to get our s--t together for ourselves. And we're
getting reamed in Washington by the record companies, by the
Internet companies, by big business in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not careful, we're going to sleep through it and have
all our rights taken from us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want this younger generation of rock 'n' roll
artists,'' he says. ``I know they resent a lot of us '70s artists _
I know Billy Corgan doesn't think very highly of people like me.
But whether they like me or my generation or not, there's work to
be done in the artistic community and in the world community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they all develop a social conscience at some point,''
Henley adds. ``They probably have one, but there's a lot of ways
you can waste your time thinking you're doing good things. There's
a lot of causes out there, but some are more important than
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Any conversation with Henley, of course, ends up involving the
Eagles, the iconic Rock and Roll Hall of Fame group whose 1976
collection ``Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975'' has been the
biggest-selling album in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The group dissolved amid much acrimony during the early 1980s,
but came back together in 1994 for a successful reunion tour that
spanned two years.
</P>
<P>
   The band started work on a new studio album last year, but
Henley says a combination of factors conspired to put the Eagles on
the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really at a point in my album where I thought I could
divide my time and my attention and my creativity between my
project and that project,'' Henley says, ``and I found I couldn't
do it. My album had to take priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, frankly, I don't think it was going very well,'' he
admits. ``We were definitely headed down the track towards making a
very mediocre record, and I think we needed some distance from
it.''

DON BLUTH, ON `TITAN A.E.,' IS AS ANIMATED AS EVER

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a photo of Don Bluth, co-director of ``Titan A.E.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 c.2000 Ian Spelling  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though warm as a campfire and always soft-spoken, animator Don
Bluth, the man behind such features as ``The Secret of NIMH''
(1982), ``An American Tail'' (1986), ``All Dogs Go To Heaven''
(1989) and ``Anastasia'' (1998), calls a spade a spade,
consequences be damned.
</P>
<P>
   There's a no-nonsense tone in his voice, an edge that just might
benefit his latest animated epic, ``Titan A.E.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-directed by Bluth and his longtime partner, Gary Goldman,
``Titan, A.E.'' unfolds in 3028, as aliens called the Drej destroy
the Earth, leaving a million survivors stranded in assorted drifter
colonies. One survivor, the cynical 20-year-old Cale (voiced by
Matt Damon), learns that he is genetically coded to be a map that
will lead to the Titan, a ship with the power to create a new
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the earlier films I've done in my career are pretty
much in the area of Disney wannabes,'' Bluth says by telephone from
a Phoenix screening room, where he's racing to finish the film in
time for its June 16 release. ``They would have a terminal disease,
a terminal disease that I call cute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is very soft and round and cute and harmless,'' he
explains. ``That's what Disney is. We tried to shift over to an
edgier picture with `Titan A.E.,' one that's not a wannabe. We were
hunting for something that had a little more quills on it, that was
more prickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of digs in the dialogue, a lot of sarcasm,''
the director says. ``It's faster-paced than most of my films. I
don't think people can look at it and say it's in the Don Bluth
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluth laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing,'' he adds.
``I have no objectivity about this film. All I know is that it's
very different from anything I've done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluth and Goldman weren't supposed to make ``Titan A.E.'' They'd
crafted ``Anastasia'' at Fox's fledgling animation facility in
Arizona, followed that with a direct-to-video sequel, ``Bartok the
Magnificent'' (2000), and then sat empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Fox president Bill Mechanic then phoned Bluth and Goldman. The
two directors assigned to ``Titan A.E.'' _ then called ``Planet
Ice'' _ were off the project. Mechanic asked Bluth and Goldman to
pick up the baton, warning that time was of the essence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had fewer months than we'd ever had before,'' Bluth
recalls, ``but we said, `If there's nothing else ready, we don't
have much choice, do we?' So we grabbed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, like any good soldier, I surrounded myself with sci-fi
brains who seemed to know all the genre movies that had ever been
made,'' he says. ``I said, `Tell me why some sci-fi movies are
really, really exciting, why some of them work so well.'''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bluth, his predecessors had sunk $30 million into
artwork and scripting before he ever put ink to acetate. Damon,
Drew Barrymore, Bill Pullman, Nathan Lane and Janeane Garofalo had
already recorded dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Starting over, however, was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `We're going to take this artwork and reorganize it,
so it's something we can use,''' Bluth says. ``I had a really good
art director and production designer. We shuffled through all of
this stuff and said, `OK, here's what we're going to do.' That
seemed to work out really well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, when I got into the picture, it seemed to me that the
entire focus was on the hardware,'' he recalls. ``I thought, `Who
wants to look at just hardware?' I was reminded that a lot of
people do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a movie to me is about character, about how personalities
come together, how they relate to each other and what the
ramifications of that are,'' Bluth says. ``We went back, crammed in
more of the character material, re-recorded some of the dialogue,
and now character drives the story. We were on this film for many
months, and even in the last week new lines were being written.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the film is about to be released, Bluth must face his
greatest nemesis: the Mouse House. As it has for ages, Walt Disney
Pictures will pit one of its own animated features directly against
Bluth's. ``Fantasia 2000'' will open nationwide on the same day
``Titan A.E.'' hits the screens.
</P>
<P>
   One might think there's enough room in the world for multiple
animated success stories. Bluth, however, doubts that Disney feels
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would often get angry,'' says Bluth, who toiled for Disney
as an animator on such films as ``Robin Hood'' (1973) and ``Pete's
Dragon'' (1978). ``I used to think, `How could they be so
uncharitable?' But business is business. I think that's the way
they look at it, that all is fair in business and they don't mind
who they kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is the giant,'' he says. ``Even though I'm working with
Fox, I still think of myself as the David. Disney has a lot of
muscle, and I don't suppose anybody really knows how much muscle
they do have. They can block and can do anything they have to do to
make sure they win.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's all done with a very beautiful veneer, so no one ever
suspects there's anything sinister underneath it.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters further, there's more at stake with ``Titan
A.E.'' than meets the eye. It's conceivable that Fox might give up
on animation entirely if ``Titan A.E.'' tanks. Dreamworks _ whose
animation division is helmed by another Disney refugee, Steve
Katzenberg _ will release ``Chicken Run'' this summer, but surely
can't abide too many disappointments along the lines of its most
recent effort, ``The Road to El Dorado'' (2000).
</P>
<P>
   ``Anastasia is in the black at this point, but it didn't really
go out there and change the world one bit,'' Bluth says. ``So we
went in for a second one, and I believe everyone is saying, `Well,
if this one doesn't work, then what?'
</P>
<P>
   ``In tandem with what we've been doing is Katzenberg. `Prince of
Egypt' (1998) was going to blow the world away and it didn't _ it's
not in the black yet. Right after that they did `Road to El
Dorado.' It was a little disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless somebody steps up, throws a spear and hits the coconut,
I think we're sort of pronouncing our own doom,'' Bluth says.
``It's no secret that Fox has laid off a lot of our staff. A lot.
There were 360 and it's down to 60. So there's a lot at stake.''

<P>
   Angelina Jolie lives on the edge. Forget planning. Forget the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always right in the moment,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the moment dictated that the screen beauty dye
her hair a color best described as ``grandmother blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, her advisors went berserk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told, `You know, Angelina, people are taking you
seriously now. You've got to take yourself seriously,''' Jolie
says, mimicking the voice of a Hollywood agent.
</P>
<P>
   She sighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are suddenly concerned about my hair?'' she says.
``Please. I was like, `I don't think we fooled anyone.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Jolie delights in making waves. This is a woman
who literally jumped into a swimming pool in her ball gown after
winning a Golden Globe Award for ``Gia'' (1998). She isn't adorned
with jewels but with tattoos, including a large ``H'' which stands
for Haven, her brother's middle name.
</P>
<P>
   Recently she took a plunge of a different sort by marrying actor
Billy Bob Thornton. No one even knew that the two actors, who met
on the set of ``Pushing Tin'' (1998), were dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' Jolie says, ``when I'm 90, they will never be able to
say, `Oh, she was just another boring starlet.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement. Even her clothes come with that Jolie
twist. She isn't wearing DKNY or Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try Wal-Mart,'' she jokes, allowing those ridiculously puffy
lips to burst into a smile. ``Hey, it was the only thing that was
clean. I don't have time to go to the cleaners.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds reasonable. After all, her career is in overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie stars opposite Nicolas Cage and Delroy Lindo in ``Gone in
60 Seconds,'' opening June 9. It's the story of a contest between
two rival gangs of car thieves, vying to prove which group can
``collect'' the most merchandise in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do the film because it was high art,'' Jolie says.
``It was my summer vacation last year, and frankly I wanted to
learn about cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know how to steal a car now, although maybe I shouldn't
get that out there,'' she says. ``We actually had a real thief on
the set, escorted by his prison guard. I didn't know who they were
the first time. I thought they were two prop guys and then I got
the skinny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the thief a million questions,'' she says, ``and this
guy could rip apart an entire car and tell you every single part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After two serious films _ ``The Bone Collector'' (1999) and
``Girl, Interrupted'' (1999), which earned her a Best Supporting
Actress Oscar as a deranged mental patient _ she was ready for some
screen fun. But Jolie is quick to say that she's still a serious
actress.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that's why she turned down the upcoming big-screen
version of ``Charlie's Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Charlie's Angels' people had a few selling points,''
Jolie says. ``They told me there weren't many good characters for
strong women. But I countered that I've been able to play strong
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was also told that doing `Charlie's Angels' `will make you a
big star,''' she says, ``which is frightening and not a plus in my
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at it as a money job,'' she concludes. ``Given the
fact that I don't really like to get dressed up in high heels, it
wasn't worth it to me. I figured that my fun job was `Gone in 60
Seconds.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And, frankly, I thought car thieves and hanging out with the
boys was just so much cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie, who is the daughter of actor Jon Voight and actress
Marcheline Bertrand, says she isn't overly impressed with her
newfound stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I have the same acting abilities,'' she says. ``It's not
like I'm suddenly a better actress because I have awards or this
box-office clout. It's just that now I'm on more covers of
magazines. It's easier to hire me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't take my successes personally,'' Jolie adds.
``I still think I'm someone who got very lucky. I'm someone who
people took a chance on, a few years ago when I was no one in this
town. And now? I don't think I'm so important _ I'm just an actress
for hire.''
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean that she has any problems with her
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am secure in the fact that I do have something to offer as
an actress,'' Jolie says. ``I've done justice to my roles. I've
always felt that I was the best person to do the roles that I've
been offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, I still won't take a role unless I think I am the
best person to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite role to date was, predictably, her Oscar-winning
turn in ``Girl, Interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved that movie,'' she says. ``I got to fling the windows
open and just breathe and scream. It felt so good. I got to push
buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite characters are those who, like the mental patient
Lisa in ``Girl, Interrupted,'' face internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a side of me that understands conflicted emotions,''
Jolie says. ``For instance, when I'm intense I might be crying, but
a whole other side of me is angry that I'm crying _ you know, if
I'm soft, I hate myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do self-pity,'' the actress says. ``I want to scream,
`I am not weak!' I'm one of those people who need to learn to let
somebody hug me. I need to learn to need other people.''

`LEXX' EXPLORES SCI-FI'S LUSTIER SIDE

 (Includes a color slide of a scene from ``Lexx.'') 
 By CHRISTOPHER BLAND  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before June 11. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It has been called ``Star Trek's'' evil twin.
 &HT;    In the sci-fi series ``Lexx,'' there are no final frontiersmen
selflessly rescuing alien kittens from trees. Along the darkly
humorous edge of ``Lexx,'' lust bubbles and life is cheap.
 &HT;    As science fiction, it's something different. As television,
``Lexx'' is downright bizarre. ``Lexx'' is a siren of distinction
for its black comedy, skewed take on the human condition and open
sexuality, qualities that act as counterpoints to contemporary
sci-fi sensibilities, according to Lex Gigeroff, co-writer of the
show, along with Jeffrey Hirschfield _ who also voices the show's
lust-struck robot, 790 _ and executive producer Paul Donovan.
 &HT;    Perhaps some of its unique style comes from the fact that the
series is filmed in a remote area of Canada _ Halifax, Nova Scotia.
And the people behind the show are all dedicated to taking a
low-key, unassuming approach to the genre.
 &HT;    ``Science fiction has a tendency sometimes to be very pompous
about itself,'' Gigeroff says, speaking from the Halifax office of
Salter Street Films, which co-produces ``Lexx'' with Germany's Time
Film und TV Produktion.
 &HT;    ``We're really dealing with weighty issues here,'' he adds,
``but there's all sorts of ways of doing that. You can do that in a
heavy-handed way or in a bit more of an ironic or off-center way,
and I think that's the trick, trying to find the outside edge of
science fiction.''
 &HT;    Gigeroff realizes that ``Lexx'' is not the first show to walk
sci-fi's fringes, beginning with the landmark ``The Prisoner''
(1967), which starred Patrick McGoohan.
 &HT;    ``There were things like `The Prisoner,' which was certainly
dark at times,'' he says, ``and also things like `Dark Star,' John
Carpenter's dark 1974 space comedy.''
 &HT;    ``Lexx'' debuted in 1996 as four made-for-television movies
called ``Lexx: The Dark Zone Stories,'' now called season one. The
movies came two years after Paul Donovan's 1994 movie ``Paint
Cans,'' which featured Gigeroff and Canadian actor Michael McManus,
who plays ``Lexx's'' undead assassin, Kai.
 &HT;    Two years later, ``Lexx'' returned as a 13-part series, then
returned again this spring with 13 new segments. ``Lexx'' is most
popular in the United States, Canada, Britain, France and Germany.
Yet fans exist even farther abroad: Linked to ``Lexx's'' Web site
(www.Lexx.com) are a few sites in Russia.
 &HT;    On the simplest level, ``Lexx'' is the story of three space
outcasts _ Kai, Stanley Tweedle (Brian Downey) and Xev (Xenia
Seeburg) _ wandering space in a cybernetically enhanced insect
spacecraft, the Lexx.
 &HT;    ``It's a show that's not really connected to Earth in any way,''
Gigeroff says. ``They are not colonists from Earth ... So it kind
of gives you a lot of freedom, a really tremendous latitude to go
for it.''
 &HT;    That latitude resulted in a change to this season's story
structure. While season two was a series of stand-alone episodes,
this year is a narrative centered around an interplanetary war.
 &HT;    ``Paul really liked the idea of being able to take a bit more
time with some stories,'' Gigeroff says.
 &HT;    ``It's sometimes a challenge to create a wholly self-contained
little universe each week,'' he adds. ``You can take a bit of time
with some characters, which is what we tried to do with Nigel,''
meaning Nigel Bennett, the Emmy Award-winning Canadian actor cast
as season three's recurring character, Prince.
 &HT;    Another change involved Seeburg. Introduced during season two as
a replacement for German actress Eva Haberman, who played Xev's
progenitor, Zev, in the ``Lexx'' movies, Seeburg first appeared as
a savvy, red-haired love slave. The change to Seeburg's natural
blond tresses resulted during production this season, once Seeburg
was sure that fans had accepted her as Haberman's replacement.
 &HT;    ``People would see me like I look in real life, even the people
that I worked with, and they would always go, `Oh, Xenia, it's so
good to see you without that horrible red wig,''' Seeburg says from
her home in Dusseldorf, Germany. ``So finally it was like an
all-around agreement.''
 &HT;    A constant of the show has been its stunning digital effects,
created by Filmeffekte GMBH in Germany and CAGE Digital in Halifax.
Yet the effects, too, have evolved: This season was shot using
high-definition technology that was blended with digital imagery,
then treated on video for a film effect.
 &HT;    Perhaps the only thing that hasn't changed is the knack of the
cowardly captain, Stanley Tweedle, for routinely finding himself in
life-and-death situations.
 &HT;    ``We really think it's one of our missions in life to put Brian
Downey in as many uncomfortable shooting positions as possible,
just because he's such a great guy,'' Gigeroff jokes. ``Paul and I
will be talking about what we're doing, and Brian will come by and
ask, `What are you going to put me in next week?' And he does it
cheerfully.''
 &HT;    He's pleased that ``Lexx'' has won a fan base, but Gigeroff says
the producers never aimed for mass appeal.
 &HT;    ``We've always kind of wanted to try and get a little cult
show,'' he says. ``This is never going to be a show which everybody
is going to like. It was never meant to be.''
 &HT;    Some of the show's guest stars have been cult icons in their own
rights. Malcolm McDowell, who played an ultraviolent ``droogie'' in
``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), has appeared. So have Rutger Hauer,
who was the tragic antagonist Roy Batty in ``Blade Runner'' (1982),
and Tim Curry, still best known as just a sweet transvestite in
``The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' (1975).
 &HT;    As for the future, Gigeroff refuses to speculate. Given the
precarious nature of television, he says, he's content for the
moment with what he calls ``an incredible rocket ride so far.''

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of rock star Don Henley.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 c.2000 Gary Graff  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1984, Don Henley _ the once and future singer/drummer
for the Eagles _ lamented in song that there was ``Not Enough Love
in the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, on his first solo album of all-new material in 11 years,
Henley informs us that ``I'm very, very happy/And I know that's not
what you'd expect from me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley isn't kidding. He's been married since 1995 to Sharon
Summerall, a fellow Texan with whom he moved from California to a
home outside Dallas, where they're raising three children. He has
found a life's calling outside music in the Walden Woods Project,
an environmental-preservation organization. And this year he and
his Eagles partner Glenn Frey are being inducted into the
Songwriter's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the spirit of bonhomie saturates Henley's new
album, ``Inside Job.'' There are still plenty of pointed social and
political commentaries amid the 13 tracks, but they're balanced by
songs that celebrate the happy state of his home life, including
``Nobody Else in the World But You,'' ``Taking You Home,''
``Everything is Different Now,'' ``My Thanksgiving'' and
``Annabel,'' a lullaby for his oldest daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has certainly had an inspirational effect,'' the
52-year-old Henley says. ``At the risk of sounding like I've been
in some sort of self-help program _ which I haven't _ I've
rediscovered my better self. I feel in my mind and in my heart like
I did when I was in my early 20s, when I was in college _ and I'm
not drunk or high!''
</P>
<P>
   Henley is quick to add that he's always considered himself an
optimist, and he felt that as a songwriter his mission was to point
out that things could be better. But he also acknowledges that the
sweet tenor of ``Inside Job'' will catch off-guard those who are
used to the sharp tone of past hits such as ``Dirty Laundry,''
``Sunset Grill,'' ``All She Wants to Do is Dance'' and the
Grammy-winning ``The End of the Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has crossed my mind that it might not be very well received
or it might even be ridiculed in some quarters,'' says Henley, who
moved to Los Angeles in 1970 with his band, Shiloh, before joining
Linda Ronstadt's band and subsequently forming the Eagles in 1971.
``But you know, I don't (care) anymore. This woman and these
children have helped me to rediscover myself, and I don't mind
putting that out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a very liberating thing for me,'' he adds. ``I've
gotten so much strength and courage from my family that I can
afford to be totally open and honest about how I feel. If people
like it, great. And if they don't, that's great, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley has not run out of dragons to slay, however. ``Workin'
It,'' the first single from ``Inside Job,'' offers Henley's take on
the current state of American society. ``They're Not Here, They're
Not Coming'' pokes fun at UFO disciples, while ``Damn It, Rose''
was inspired by a friend's suicide and deals with what Henley calls
``empty rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   But while that kind of song used to dominate his albums and seep
into his other material, Henley feels that the fire doesn't burn
within him in quite the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can always go home to the children and to the wife, and the
world goes away for a little while,'' Henley says. ``That gives me
the strength and the serenity to live with those things. But, yes,
it has heightened my awareness and, yes, it has made me more angry.
But I think that's balanced, because my life is more balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley _ who left his former label, Geffen, to move to Warner
Bros. Records for ``Inside Job'' _ does have a new battle to wage.
He and some other artists, including his former backup singer
Sheryl Crow, Billy Joel, Bonnie Raitt and Hole's Courtney Love,
have joined forces to fight the music industry and Congress over
what the musicians feel are actions that are being taken to strip
them of their rights to their own work.
</P>
<P>
   Henley explains that the 1976 Copyright Act provided for the
full return of an artist's work to that artist after 35 years. But
the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the
record companies, has quietly inserted an amendment _ tagged onto
an unrelated bill _ that reclassified recordings as work for hire,
which allows the labels to own them forever.
</P>
<P>
   This is part of the ``greedfest'' that has followed the recent
spate of entertainment-industry mergers, Henley says, and he feels
that ``it's just the first shot across the bow from the record
company. I think they're going to keep on trying to ... cheat
artists out of the rights to their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley expects the amendment to be passed into law, and is
frustrated at what he sees as other artists' lack of willingness to
lend their voices to the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists have managed to get organized for all other causes _
for the rain forest, for the environment in general, for
anti-nukes, for cures for cancer, for the homeless, for hunger ...
all manner of charity work we've done,'' Henley says. ``But we've
never been able to get our s--t together for ourselves. And we're
getting reamed in Washington by the record companies, by the
Internet companies, by big business in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not careful, we're going to sleep through it and have
all our rights taken from us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want this younger generation of rock 'n' roll
artists,'' he says. ``I know they resent a lot of us '70s artists _
I know Billy Corgan doesn't think very highly of people like me.
But whether they like me or my generation or not, there's work to
be done in the artistic community and in the world community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they all develop a social conscience at some point,''
Henley adds. ``They probably have one, but there's a lot of ways
you can waste your time thinking you're doing good things. There's
a lot of causes out there, but some are more important than
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Any conversation with Henley, of course, ends up involving the
Eagles, the iconic Rock and Roll Hall of Fame group whose 1976
collection ``Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975'' has been the
biggest-selling album in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The group dissolved amid much acrimony during the early 1980s,
but came back together in 1994 for a successful reunion tour that
spanned two years.
</P>
<P>
   The band started work on a new studio album last year, but
Henley says a combination of factors conspired to put the Eagles on
the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really at a point in my album where I thought I could
divide my time and my attention and my creativity between my
project and that project,'' Henley says, ``and I found I couldn't
do it. My album had to take priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, frankly, I don't think it was going very well,'' he
admits. ``We were definitely headed down the track towards making a
very mediocre record, and I think we needed some distance from
it.''

DON BLUTH, ON `TITAN A.E.,' IS AS ANIMATED AS EVER

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a photo of Don Bluth, co-director of ``Titan A.E.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 c.2000 Ian Spelling  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though warm as a campfire and always soft-spoken, animator Don
Bluth, the man behind such features as ``The Secret of NIMH''
(1982), ``An American Tail'' (1986), ``All Dogs Go To Heaven''
(1989) and ``Anastasia'' (1998), calls a spade a spade,
consequences be damned.
</P>
<P>
   There's a no-nonsense tone in his voice, an edge that just might
benefit his latest animated epic, ``Titan A.E.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-directed by Bluth and his longtime partner, Gary Goldman,
``Titan, A.E.'' unfolds in 3028, as aliens called the Drej destroy
the Earth, leaving a million survivors stranded in assorted drifter
colonies. One survivor, the cynical 20-year-old Cale (voiced by
Matt Damon), learns that he is genetically coded to be a map that
will lead to the Titan, a ship with the power to create a new
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the earlier films I've done in my career are pretty
much in the area of Disney wannabes,'' Bluth says by telephone from
a Phoenix screening room, where he's racing to finish the film in
time for its June 16 release. ``They would have a terminal disease,
a terminal disease that I call cute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is very soft and round and cute and harmless,'' he
explains. ``That's what Disney is. We tried to shift over to an
edgier picture with `Titan A.E.,' one that's not a wannabe. We were
hunting for something that had a little more quills on it, that was
more prickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of digs in the dialogue, a lot of sarcasm,''
the director says. ``It's faster-paced than most of my films. I
don't think people can look at it and say it's in the Don Bluth
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluth laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing,'' he adds.
``I have no objectivity about this film. All I know is that it's
very different from anything I've done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluth and Goldman weren't supposed to make ``Titan A.E.'' They'd
crafted ``Anastasia'' at Fox's fledgling animation facility in
Arizona, followed that with a direct-to-video sequel, ``Bartok the
Magnificent'' (2000), and then sat empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Fox president Bill Mechanic then phoned Bluth and Goldman. The
two directors assigned to ``Titan A.E.'' _ then called ``Planet
Ice'' _ were off the project. Mechanic asked Bluth and Goldman to
pick up the baton, warning that time was of the essence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had fewer months than we'd ever had before,'' Bluth
recalls, ``but we said, `If there's nothing else ready, we don't
have much choice, do we?' So we grabbed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, like any good soldier, I surrounded myself with sci-fi
brains who seemed to know all the genre movies that had ever been
made,'' he says. ``I said, `Tell me why some sci-fi movies are
really, really exciting, why some of them work so well.'''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bluth, his predecessors had sunk $30 million into
artwork and scripting before he ever put ink to acetate. Damon,
Drew Barrymore, Bill Pullman, Nathan Lane and Janeane Garofalo had
already recorded dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Starting over, however, was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `We're going to take this artwork and reorganize it,
so it's something we can use,''' Bluth says. ``I had a really good
art director an production designer. We shuffled through all of
this stuff and said, `OK, here's what we're going to do.' That
seemed to work out really well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, when I got into the picture, it seemed to me that the
entire focus was on the hardware,'' he recalls. ``I thought, `Who
wants to look at just hardware?' I was reminded that a lot of
people do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a movie to me is about character, about how personalities
come together, how they relate to each other and what the
ramifications of that are,'' Bluth says. ``We went back, crammed in
more of the character material, re-recorded some of the dialogue,
and now character drives the story. We were on this film for many
months, and even in the last week new lines were being written.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the film is about to be released, Bluth must face his
greatest nemesis: the Mouse House. As it has for ages, Walt Disney
Pictures will pit one of its own animated features directly against
Bluth's. ``Fantasia 2000'' will open nationwide on the same day
``Titan A.E.'' hits the screens.
</P>
<P>
   One might think there's enough room in the world for multiple
animated success stories. Bluth, however, doubts that Disney feels
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would often get angry,'' says Bluth, who toiled for Disney
as an animator on such films as ``Robin Hood'' (1973) and ``Pete's
Dragon'' (1978). ``I used to think, `How could they be so
uncharitable?' But business is business. I think that's the way
they look at it, that all is fair in business and they don't mind
who they kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is the giant,'' he says. ``Even though I'm working with
Fox, I still think of myself as the David. Disney has a lot of
muscle, and I don't suppose anybody really knows how much muscle
they do have. They can block and can do anything they have to do to
make sure they win.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's all done with a very beautiful veneer, so no one ever
suspects there's anything sinister underneath it.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters further, there's more at stake with ``Titan
A.E.'' than meets the eye. It's conceivable that Fox might give up
on animation entirely if ``Titan A.E.'' tanks. Dreamworks _ whose
animation division is helmed by another Disney refugee, Steve
Katzenberg _ will release ``Chicken Run'' this summer, but surely
can't abide too many disappointments along the lines of its most
recent effort, ``The Road to El Dorado'' (2000).
</P>
<P>
   ``Anastasia is in the black at this point, but it didn't really
go out there and change the world one bit,'' Bluth says. ``So we
went in for a second one, and I believe everyone is saying, `Well,
if this one doesn't work, then what?'
</P>
<P>
   ``In tandem with what we've been doing is Katzenberg. `Prince of
Egypt' (1998) was going to blow the world away and it didn't _ it's
not in the black yet. Right after that they did `Road to El
Dorado.' It was a little disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless somebody steps up, throws a spear and hits the coconut,
I think we're sort of pronouncing our own doom,'' Bluth says.
``It's no secret that Fox has laid off a lot of our staff. A lot.
There were 360 and it's down to 60. So there's a lot at stake.''

`RUNNING FREE': ON FREEDOM TRAIL WITH A TALKING HORSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Horses are noble, spirited creatures, but what do they think
about? If they were granted the power of speech, what would they
say? The old television series `` Ed'' presented one version of
equine consciousness, but you won't hear any stable-door wisecracks
in ``Running Free,'' Sergei Bodrov's earnest, music-drenched story
of a plucky young colt's adventures in the deserts of southern
Africa. It turns out that horses _ or Lucky, at least, who narrates
the film in the pleasant adolescent tenor of Lukas Haas _ are
masters of the obvious who think and speak entirely in movie
cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky is born in the midst of an ocean voyage from Germany to
Africa, where his mother is being shipped to work in the copper
mines. ``Africa was far away,'' he notes perceptively. At first the
white human characters speak German until, for the convenience of
the audience, they switch to Afrikaans _ and British-accented
English. Meanwhile Lucky channels horse language for us. When an
imperious stallion named Caesar whinnies and snorts, Lucky explains
that he is ``furious that a lowly workhorse had dared to enter his
domain.'' And when Caesar's spunky daughter Beauty shakes her mane
around to announce her presence as Lucky's love interest, her beau
remarks that she's ``funny and full of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she could have shared some of her jokes with the
filmmakers, who mistake muzzy, mystical sentimentality for
childlike wonder. This is somewhat surprising, in view of the
accomplishments of Bodrov, best known in this country for his
Oscar-nominated ``Prisoner of the Mountains,'' and the screenwriter
Jeanne Rosenberg, who collaborated on the script of Carol Ballard's
``Black Stallion,'' a horsy flick of unusually broad and durable
appeal. But then again, Rosenberg shares a story credit with
Jean-Jacques Annaud, the film's producer and the perpetrator of
such acts of high-concept cinematic paganism as ``Quest for Fire''
and ``The Bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Like those films. ``Running Free'' can be very beautiful to look
at. Shot on location in Namibia, it includes some gorgeous aerial
shots of the vast orange emptiness in which Lucky longs to run
free. But the equine action sequences are poorly edited, and the
voice-over and the sugary Windham Hill-inspired world music score
combine to mar the glories of nature, one of which, after all, is
silence.
</P>
<P>
   The plot blends a bit of ``Bambi'' with a dollop of ``Lassie,''
as the film's treatment of animals vacillates between cutesy
Disney-style anthropomorphism and ``Born Free'' exoticism. Lucky
befriends an orphaned stable boy named Richard (Chase Moore), who
works for the grouchy Boss Man (Jan Decleir), owner of Caesar, and
the two of them, on a desert ramble, befriend a young African girl
named Nyka (Maria Geelbooi), who stars in the film's most
emblematically ridiculous scene. As boy, girl and horse sit around
a campfire, Richard pulls out his harmonica, plays a few bars and
then hands it to Nyka, who faultlessly reels off the movie's love
theme, which obligingly swells to its full orchestration as the
camera lifts into the desert night. But why didn't Lucky get a
turn?

   Daughters' Gift to the Modern
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ian Woodner, the Manhattan real estate developer who
died in 1990, was one of the greatest collectors in the United
States. Besides an extraordinary group of drawings, some of which
were acquired by the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1991,
he amassed a large group of Cycladic works of art.
</P>
<P>
   He also had passion for paintings, drawings and prints by the
19th-century French artist Odilon Redon. He put together the
largest group of Redons in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Woodner's two daughters, Dian and Andrea, oversee the Ian
Woodner Family Collection, a foundation that Woodner established
before his death. They have given the Museum of Modern Art nearly
100 paintings, pastels, watercolors, drawings, prints and
illustrated books by Redon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a painter, too, and he would paint in the style
of Redon,'' said Dian Woodner.
</P>
<P>
   The works the foundation is giving the Modern represent only
about half of Woodner's collection of Redons. Some still belong to
his daughters, said Joshua Rubenstein, Dian Woodner's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Woodner said she and her sister wanted to develop a relationship
with an institution in their hometown, which is one reason they
chose to give the Redons to the Modern. The other, she added, was
that ``Redon is one of the first modern painters, and I think his
work will shine at the Modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Lowry, the Modern's director, called the gift ``one that
came from heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Redon was an artist we never had great strength in,'' he
added. ``Now, in one shot, we have a collection that puts us second
only to the Musee d'Orsay in both range and quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The gift includes early studies from nature, still lifes and
mythological images.
</P>
<P>
   While individual works from the Woodner collection will be on
view from time to time, Lowry said the museum was planning an
exhibition devoted to the entire collection once its major
expansion is completed in four to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Biennial Buys
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney Museum of American Art has made a tradition of
buying a selection of works it features in its Biennials. Curators
compile lists of works they would like the museum to buy and then
make proposals to the appropriate committees, made up of trustees
and others who help raise the money and make the final decisions.
</P>
<P>
   This year the museum has bought works by 20 Biennial artists.
``It's a varied list,'' said Lawrence Rinder, the new curator of
contemporary art. ``Half are by artists who have not been
represented in the Whitney's collection before.'' Rinder stressed
the importance of adding Biennial artists to the museum's
collection. ``Great works by key American artists are an important
legacy to continue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artists entering the museum's collection for the first
time are Dara Friedman, whose ``Bim Bam'' consists of two films,
one shown directly above the other, projecting sideways images of a
woman repeatedly opening and closing a door; Doug Aitken, whose
``Electric Earth,'' a video piece installed in a maze of rooms, won
a prize at last summer's Venice Bienniale; Silvia Kolbowski, whose
``Inadequate History of Conceptual Art'' is a video and sound
installation; Inigo Manglano-Ovalle's video installation ``The
Kiss,'' which shows the artist washing a glass wall of Mies van der
Rohe's Farnsworth House; and E.V. Day's exploded evening dress,
``Bombshell.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum also decided to add works of artists already in its
collection, but not necessarily with purchases from the Biennial.
It is continuing to build a collection of works by Robert Gober,
but rather than buy his sculpture of a sink with human legs that is
in the Biennial, the museum has bought three more of his color
lithographs.
</P>
<P>
   Dia's Museum
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months after the Dia Center for the Arts announced that
it would open a $20 million museum in an abandoned paperboard
factory in Beacon, N.Y., a depressed Hudson River town, this
contemporary arts institution is holding something of a
groundbreaking ceremony Friday, with Gov. George Pataki presiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've finished the environmental cleanup and major
construction is about to begin,'' said Michael Govan, director of
Dia.
</P>
<P>
   Dia officials have drawn up plans for the building's renovations
with Open Office, a Chelsea architectural firm. The scheme has also
had advice from several living artists represented in Dia's
collection, including Walter de Maria, Richard Serra, Michael
Heizer and John Chamberlain, who have been involved in designing
galleries devoted to their works.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Irwin, the California artist who designed the central
garden for the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, has created a
grid of flowering trees that form a canopy over the parking lot
opening onto a piazza, which serves as the museum entrance. Irwin
has also been involved in plans for the entire complex. ``He has
orchestrated natural light throughout the building so there will
never have to be lights on during daylight hours,'' Govan said.
</P>
<P>
   An Appointment
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Beckelman has been appointed to the new position of
deputy director of special projects at the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Museum. Beckelman is vice president of the World Monuments Fund and
was previously executive director of the Joseph Papp Public Theater
and chairwoman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   By special projects, the museum means the creation of the new
museum, designed by the Los Angeles architect Frank Gehry, that it
hopes to build overlooking the East River at the foot of Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laurie will be working on the progress of how to make it
happen,'' said Judith Cox, a deputy director of the Guggenheim.
``She will help push that process along. &QL;

REMEMBERING (AND EDITING) THINGS PAST
</HEADLINE>
  By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the ultimate beach book is a really long novel,
then Proust's seven-volume ``A la Recherche du Temps Perdu'' should
top the summer reading list. ``Remembrance of Things Past,'' now
being called ``In Search of Lost Time,'' has never gone out of
print and is considered the greatest French novel of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   With summer upon us, it seems fitting that Christie's is selling
the first part of the novel _ ``Swann's Way'' _ in galley proofs
riddled with Proust's own corrections and jottings. This long-lost
set of galleys has drawn a great deal of attention since it was put
on view in March at the inauguration of Christie's opulent new
Paris headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation permitting Christie's to conduct auctions in France
has not yet been passed. So on Wednesday, Christie's will auction
the lost Proust galleys in London, and the sale is expected to be
the highlight of Book Week there.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's Proust sale includes the complete text, in annotated
galley proofs, of ``Combray,'' the earliest section of ``A la
Recherche du Temps Perdu,'' as well as the text of all but the
final page of ``Un Amour de Swann'' (``Swann in Love''). These two
parts make up most of ``Du Cote de Chez Swann'' (``Swann's Way''),
the first of the seven parts of Proust's magnum opus. The set of
galleys is expected to sell for $960,000 to $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to Verene de Soultrait, a specialist in the book
department at Christie's Paris, the proofs represent the most
important literary autograph manuscript of Proust left in private
hands. These are not simply galley proofs but proofs so extensively
marked up in Proust's own hand that they look like concrete poetry,
with a visual appeal as well as literary significance.
</P>
<P>
   Bart Auerbach, a literary appraiser in New York, explained that
Proust's novels ``are virtually rewritten on the galleys.''
</P>
<P>
   Proust was well aware of how obsessive he was in his rewriting,
adding and canceling lines until the last possible moment before
his works went into print.
</P>
<P>
   As the Christie's catalog points out, in 1913 he wrote a letter
to a J.L. Vaudoyer about ``Combray,'' admitting: ``I am busy
correcting my first proofs. New galleys arrive every day, but I
have not returned a single one yet . . . My corrections so far (I
hope that this will not go on) are more than just that. Not one
line in 20 remains of the original text (already rewritten as it
was). It is crossed out, corrected wherever I can find a blank
space, and I paste on pieces of paper at the top, bottom, left,
right, etc. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   This lost text remains unpublished to this day. ``It's a
literary event in a sense, because no one knew it was available,''
Auerbach said of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's will not reveal the name, vocation or country of the
consignor.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Reese, a rare book dealer in New Haven, Conn., said the
galleys were important because they ``address the issue of
authorial intention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The set of galleys raises the question of what is the proper
text,'' he continued. ``You see the levels of his intentions as he
goes along with his endless tinkering and reworking of the past.
The galleys are another layer in the story, a whole new set of
information on one of the great novels of the 20th century. It is a
truly important literary event.''

   Most of Proust's manuscripts are in the collection of the
National Library of France. The library bought most of its Proust
archive from Marcel Proust's niece, who inherited it from her
father, his brother. Scholars there have published two other sets
of galley proofs for ``Swann's Way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They realized, however,'' de Soultrait writes in the catalog,
concerning the lost proofs in the sale, ``that a third set must
have existed, consolidating all the revisions and adding numbers of
others, which Proust returned to the printer for subsequent page
proofs. No future critical edition of the novel may omit close
study of the extensive autograph revisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Felix de Marez Oyens, senior director of Christie's
International Department of Printed Books and Manuscripts, in
London, said: ``A lot of Proust's text is not represented in either
the second proofs or in the published edition, because he did so
much rewriting that he then crossed out. The reworkings are part of
the creative process. This is the objective expression of it, the
physical expression of his changes of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach added, ``There was always a possibility that something
like this would turn up, but it was remote. If you are a Proust
collector, this sale could be your last chance to get something.
Another opportunity might not ever come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Proust, of course, is more popular that ever. There is, for
example, the Proust Society of America, based in New York; the
aptly named NAPS, or North American Proust Society, headed up by
the New York novelist Eric Kraft; and a Proust Support Group in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Yale University Press recently published William C. Carter's
946-page ``Marcel Proust: A Life.'' Last year, Editions du
Patrimoine in France published ``Le Monde de Proust Vu par Paul
Nadar,'' a book of historic Nadar portraits of Proust and his
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Vintage published Alain De Botton's popular ``How
Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel,'' a biographical portrait
with lessons on Proustian self-improvement, like ``How to Express
Your Emotions'' and ``How to Suffer Successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of Proust runs deep. ``Camus, Sartre and Gide have
faded,'' Auerbach said. ``Proust has lasted. I have a theory that
Proust, like all great writers, created an alternative universe
that we can live in. It's the same for Trollope and Joyce. You
become part of the Proust world and it's endlessly absorbing. It's
the lost childhood in all of us. It's the detail, the beauty of the
style, the absorption. You just want to stay in it.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that E.M. Forster called ``Recherche'' a ``cathedral
of a novel.''
</P>
<P>
   In his biography, Carter notes that Proust lived through three
turbulent eras: the fin de siecle, the Belle Epoque and World War
I. He writes, ``His novel bears witness to the rich, complex
workings of the mind and heart _ memory, love, passion, both sacred
and profane _ and to the oceanic transformations that changed the
horse-and-buggy world to one of aviation, Cubism, mode in fashion,
comfort and hygiene.''
</P>
<P>
   David Rea, a retired lawyer in Sag Harbor, N.Y. who is a
longtime Proust enthusiast, put it differently. ``Proust composed
with intensity and intelligence,'' he said. ``He may have been the
first to articulate the idea of involuntary memory; how certain
sounds, smells and touches take you out of the present. Trivial
things assume the role of great things. The book touches you at a
number of levels, and when it's over, you're sorry and wish it were
longer. It's like the Odyssey. Miracles are happening all the time
despite the terrible dailiness of life.''

 &HT;    JACKSON KEEPS REMEDY RECORD OPEN IN MICROSOFT TRIAL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The judge in the Microsoft antitrust case on
Thursday gave the software giant and the government six more days
to further hone their arguments before he closes the trial's record
for good.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected order delays a final decision over what remedies
to impose on Microsoft, which has already been found to have
violated antitrust laws, for at least a week.
</P>
<P>
   It also sends a signal that U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson could need even more time to devise a solution of his own
choosing rather than relying entirely on a government draft that
has been bitterly assailed by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The order gives the Justice Department and 17 states until
Monday morning to respond to Microsoft's latest attack on their
plan to break the company into two parts.
</P>
<P>
   A 34-page defense filing, issued late Wednesday, blasted the
government's proposed decree as ``defective in numerous respects,
making the document vague and ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will then have until Wednesday morning to respond to
the government's Monday rebuttal ``if it so chooses.'' Given the
blizzard of briefs that the company's lawyers have already filed
with Jackson in their bid to derail the government plan, it seems
unlikely that yet another such opportunity would be missed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said the prosecutors, in a
conference call with Jackson, had asked for a chance to file
another brief in the landmark case. ``This new delay should raise
some serious questions about the government's plan and the entire
process employed in this case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cullinan said David Boies, the government's lead trial attorney,
had acknowledged during the exchange that Microsoft had raised ``a
number of valid points'' about the proposed decree in its current
form.
</P>
<P>
   Several government lawyers are also known to be concerned about
the impact of the breakup on the company's foreign markets, which
for the most part are subject to external sets of antitrust laws.
The company does business in more than 110 countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the most recent Microsoft filing, Gina
Talamona, a Justice Department spokesperson, had characterized
Microsoft's complaints as ``another effort to posture for appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Microsoft, the most actively traded U.S. stock, rose
$2 to $64.56 after Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. analyst Rick Sherlund said
the stock ``might be able to recover some lost ground'' following
Jackson's remedy ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Significant portions of that ruling are likely to be stayed,
pending an appeal which almost surely will be heard, sooner or
later, by the U.S. Supreme Court.

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies. Ratings and running times are in
parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   ``BATTLEFIELD EARTH,'' starring John Travolta and Barry Pepper.
Directed by Roger Christian (PG-13, 117 minutes). In the year 3000
beings from the planet Psychlo conquer Earth in only nine minutes
and reduce all humans to grunting illiterates. The chief nasty,
Terl ( Travolta), devises a scheme to put the man-animals to work
in the gold mines for him. He sees potential in one cave dweller (
Pepper) and straps him to a machine that beams the wisdom of the
ages into his head. Little does Terl realize that by educating a
human, he is sowing the seeds of his own destruction. Sitting
through this film with its stock villains is like watching the most
expensively mounted high school play of all time. It may be a bit
early to make such judgments, but ``Battlefield Earth'' may well
turn out to be the worst movie of this century (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``CENTER STAGE,'' starring Ethan Stiefel, Sascha Radetsky,
Amanda Schull, Peter Gallagher and Donna Murphy. Directed by
Nicholas Hytner (PG-13, 113 minutes). Hytner's film tracks the
professional and romantic travails of a group of young dancers at
the fictitious American Ballet Academy in New York. The script is a
patchwork of show biz movie and romantic comedy cliches and the
acting rarely rises above daytime soap-opera obviousness, but who
ever went to a dance movie to see good writing or realistic acting?
The movie is loaded with lively dance sequences, and Hytner films
them beautifully, especially the showstopping finale, choreographed
by Susan Stroman and spiritedly danced by Stiefel, Radetsky and the
lovely Schull, who carries the movie with her energy and grace
(A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``DINOSAUR,'' with the voices of D.B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard and
Ossie Davis. Directed by Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton (PG, 90
minutes). Reputedly the most expensive animated feature ever made,
Disney's showcase of computer animation technology begins with a
breathtaking sequence, a visual and sonic extravaganza that the
rest of the movie never quite lives up to. The story, of a young
dinosaur raised by lemurs who must lead a herd of his fellow
reptiles to safety after an asteroid strikes the earth, is cobbled
together from other Disney plots. But the effects _ the dinosaur's
movements and their nearly seamless insertion into real locations _
will impress skeptical grown-ups (the movie reportedly cost about
$200 million). More important, the film, in spite of some
potentially upsetting scenes of carnivorous mayhem, will delight
children and whet their desire for the inevitable tie-in
merchandise (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``EAST-WEST,'' starring Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg Menchikov and
Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Regis Wargnier (PG-13, 115 minutes).
After World War II the Soviet government undertook a propaganda
campaign to entice Russians living in the West to return home.
Aleksei Golovine ( Menchikov) and his French wife, Marie (
Bonnaire), the couple at the heart of Wargnier's sumptuous, moving
historical melodrama, are luckier than most of their fellow
returnees, who are killed or imprisoned on arrival. ``East-West''
chronicles Aleksei's ambivalence about their new life in a drab,
depressing communal apartment and Marie's desperate attempts to
escape it. The film may be faulted for dissolving the horrors of
history in Hollywood-style catharsis, but it also uses the
resources of old-fashioned emotionally emphatic filmmaking to shed
light on forgotten history. ``East-West'' is a grand costume
pageant, full of grandeur and period detail, but it is also the
portrait of a marriage under extreme external and internal pressure
as well as a showcase for two great film actresses: Bonnaire and
Deneuve, playing an actress who becomes aware of Marie's plight
during a tour of the Soviet Union (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``FREQUENCY,'' starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel. Directed
by Gregory Hoblit (PG-13, 100 minutes). ``Back to the Future''
meets ``Field of Dreams'' meets ``It's a Wonderful Life'' meets
``The Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly
sentimental supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Caviezel is
a morose young policeman who contacts his dead father, a heroic
firefighter, on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the
accident that cost him his life during the 1969 World Series. From
here, the two collaborate on changing other aspects of the past and
on catching a serial killer. There are enough testosterone tears to
soak Shea Stadium (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``GLADIATOR,'' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie
Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott
(R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one
bothered to ask: what would happen if someone decided to film the
imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial?
Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in
the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it is
admirable but repellent. Crowe is the noble Roman general who ends
up fighting for his life. Crowe gives a performance with
ball-of-fire intensity, suffused with a movie star's impatience. He
holds the movie together, such as it is (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``HAMLET,'' starring Ethan Hawke and Liev Schreiber. Directed by
Michael Almereyda (R, 112 minutes). Almereyda has rooted his
voluptuous and rewarding new adaptation of Shakespeare's play in
today's Manhattan. The city's contradictions of beauty and squalor
give the movie a sense of place, and New York becomes a complex
character in this vital and sharply intelligent film. Often shaded
in lush, soothing hues of blue, ``Hamlet'' exudes an intoxicating
masochism in which half the cast is battling despondency and the
other half has the glint of imminent insanity. Here the melancholy
of Hamlet ( Hawke) over the death of his father is almost a state
of grace: it gives him a sense of purpose that the other characters
lack. The director's rigorous trimming has a boldness and vivacity
that make this version exhilarating while leaving Shakespeare's
language and intent intact (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``LOVE AND BASKETBALL,'' starring Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps.
Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (PG-13, 118 minutes). The
writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood's feature-film debut, about
the romantic and competitive bond between the basketball players
Monica ( Lathan) and Quincy ( Epps), has an enchanting, lived-in
homeyness. Prince-Bythewood does a wonderful job of creating an
atmosphere for her characters _ particularly for the superb Lathan
_ but the movie fails to fashion a consistent narrative. It doesn't
seem to be about anything. But it is a promising first movie from a
filmmaker with a lot to offer. Who knew anyone could get a drama
out of Title IX, the federal law ensuring that girls get a chance
to compete in high school sports? (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``M:I-2,'' starring Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton and Sir Anthony
Hopkins. Directed by John Woo (PG-13, 120 minutes). Cruise returns
as the daredevil secret agent Ethan Hunt in Woo's loud, flashy,
incoherent new blockbuster. The film is jampacked with movie
references _ to Hitchcock, to the first ``Mission: Impossible''
movie, and to Woo's earlier, and superior, Hong Kong action films _
but it's at once overheated and flat. The plot, involving killer
viruses, is baffling rather than twisty. The introduction of a love
interest ( Newton) who also happens to be the bad guy's
ex-girlfriend adds an element of melodrama that's more annoying
than affecting. Some good car chases and explosions, though
(Scott).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``ROAD TRIP,'' starring Breckin Meyer, Seann William Scott, Amy
Smart, DJ Qualls and Tom Green. Directed by Todd Phillips (R, 91
minutes). ``National Lampoon's Animal House'' meets ``There's
Something About Mary'' in the gross-out farce of the late spring.
Four college boys led by Josh ( Meyer) embark on a desperate
1,800-mile journey from upstate New York to Texas to intercept an
X-rated dorm room video mistakenly sent to Josh's loyal girlfriend
in Austin. The fun is all in the gags, among them the notorious
French toast sequence, the envelope-pushing sperm bank scene, and
the hilarious car-jumped-over-the-bridge demolition derby. You'll
laugh despite yourself (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``SHANGHAI NOON,'' starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson.
Directed by Tom Dey (PG-13, 110 minutes). Chan is one of the great
physical comedians, and this martial arts western spoof is a
high-spirited, marvelously silly showcase for his talents. Chan
plays Chon Wang, an Imperial Guard dispatched from Beijing to the
Old West to rescue a princess played by Lucy Liu. But the heart of
the movie is the interplay between Chan and Wilson, who depicts his
inept outlaw sidekick with goofy, spacey charm. After the glum
bullying of ``Gladiator'' and the noisy bombast of ``M:I-2,'' it's
refreshing to see a movie so good-natured, so confident in its
ability to provoke not queasy awe or numb exhaustion, but pure
delight (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``SMALL TIME CROOKS,'' starring Woody Allen and Tracey Ullman.
Directed and written by Allen (PG, 95 minutes). The sweet, funny
wisp of a movie starts out as a parody of ``Big Deal on Madonna
Street,'' then turns into a child's-eye ``Bonfire of the
Vanities,'' before returning to its original mode as a caper
comedy. Allen and Ullman are Ray and Frenchy Winkler, an inept
thief and ex-con and his upwardly mobile wife whose cookie business
takes off and allows her to indulge her dream of being a Park
Avenue hostess. If the movie suffers severely from attention
deficit disorder, the jokes are funny (but mild), the screwball
comic tone impeccably sustained and Ullman (putting on her Fern
Rosenthal voice) and Elaine May (as Frenchy's dimwitted cousin)
delightfully goofy (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``TIME CODE,'' starring Jeanne Tripplehorn, Saffron Burrows,
Holly Hunter and Stellan Skarsgard. Directed by Mike Figgis (R, 93
minutes). Figgis' astonishing new film, shot in a single day with
hand-held digital video cameras, tells four stories simultaneously,
in real time. ``Time Code'' is at once a mordant satire of the
hypocrisy and self-delusion of the film industry and an earnest
declaration of faith in the medium itself. In addition to its
technical innovations, which test the limits of the human eye, ear
and mind, the film boasts some brilliant improvisational acting
from its enormous cast. Especially fine are Tripplehorn and
Skarsgard, whose strongly emotional performances add a measure of
pathos. Whether ``Time Code'' will ultimately be seen as a bold
prophecy of the dawning visual age or as a passionate, gimmicky
curio is for the future to decide. At present, though, it is hard
to think of a more exciting demonstration of the inexhaustible
possibilities of film (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``U-571,'' starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Jon Bon
Jovi, David Keith and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jonathan Mostow
(PG-13, 120 minutes). Mostow, whose previous film, ``Breakdown,''
was a marvel of B-picture minimalism, shifts from the wide-open
spaces to the cramped interior of a World War II submarine movie.
McConaughey, whose knotted-with-unease face makes it look as if he
were cramming for finals, is part of a secret mission to capture a
Nazi code-encryption machine and get it back to the Allies. He and
his crew have to do so on a Nazi U-boat they have hijacked. Mostow
does a fine job of building tension, given that he is working in a
minor genre whose climactic notes you will know if you have ever
seen a movie set on a sub (Mitchell).

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some time around 1910, a company of malcontents,
political radicals, writers, theater people and artists began to
settle in Greenwich Village and declare their down-at-the-heels
neighborhood a bohemia in the European mode. Bohemia, since its
origins in 1830s Paris, had always trumpeted its social and
artistic importance, but this one's claims soared beyond even those
of its European predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The place seemed to promise an adventure at the cutting edge of
avant-garde life. As the nervy journalist John Reed, just arrived
from Harvard, lyrically wrote: ``There I got my first perceptions
of the life of my times.'' The Village, as its celebrants saw it,
would be the laboratory for the new _ making manifest the
possibilities of the young century in a way, they hoped, that would
prove irresistible to the rest of America.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1910, the huddle of brownstones, old brick houses,
renovated livery stables, tenements and declasse rooming houses had
become an antechamber to Manhattan's finer neighborhoods. But
fashionable New York _ the blue-blood society of Edith Wharton's
and Henry James' Washington Square _ was moving uptown, leaving
behind only a few enclaves of stranded elegance like the row of
beautiful Greek Revival houses on the north edge of the square.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Greenwich Village was an insular neighborhood down on
its luck, with empty lots along Fifth Avenue, ``To Let'' signs in
storefronts and poor immigrants crowded into the old brick houses,
new tenements and sweatshops south of Washington Square and west
along the narrow streets toward the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Working-class residents into the 1930s resisted the fancy
appellation of the Village and continued to call the place the
Lower West Side. But to the self-styled sophisticates just
arriving, the Village offered a stage set for an exciting,
cosmopolitan, perhaps even glorious celebration of modernity in
which they would play leading roles.
</P>
<P>
   To its enthralled participants, Greenwich Village was very much
an American bohemia, fresh, bold and big _ more widespread, both
socially and physically, than such counterparts as London's
Bloomsbury. It was bounded roughly by Washington Square and Fifth
Avenue to the east, 10th Street to the north, Houston Street to the
south and the Hudson River to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Idealistic and ambitious, the newcomers believed they were
creating something unprecedented in American arts and letters,
unimpeded by the outworn conventions of a stodgy older generation.
People who in another time and place would never have talked to one
another, never felt compelled to think about one another's
existence, found themselves in the same basement restaurants,
arguing, agreeing, staging plays, pageants and political rallies,
and ruminating endlessly about their entwined love affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Basement dives like the Golden Swan (better known as the Hell
Hole) at the northeast corner of Sixth Avenue and West Fourth
Street, once a favorite watering place of the neighborhood's
workingmen, offered cheap food and drink and late-night company.
Precincts like the congested blocks around Cornelia Street became
picturesque cityscapes. Slums turned into charming ateliers. Low
rents beckoned to those willing to put up with a floor of a
crumbling row house and live check-by-jowl with poor immigrants and
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Young John Reed, yet to win fame for his coverage of the
revolutions in Mexico and Russia, thrilled to the plebeian ambience
of the borderline slum he shared with a coven of Cambridge
classmates on the south edge of Washington Square at No. 42. They
wrote for the midtown newspapers and magazines and, as a labor of
love, for the reigning downtown journal, The Masses, at 91
Greenwich Ave., Max Eastman's monthly that drew on the Village
esprit of feminism, socialism and realism _ all mixed with a strong
dose of irreverence.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich Village in these years was a place for people in
transit, looking to make their mark on American culture. More than
a few sprang from somewhere eminent (like Harvard) and were
destined for prominent futures. Others came from the provincial
nowhere (Midwestern farms, hard-bitten factory towns, the depths of
immigrant Brooklyn) and were determined to end up somewhere. The
latter group included Louise Bryant, the feminist writer and Reed's
lover who had shed her marriage to a dentist in Portland, Ore. The
poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, from Maine, also figured among the
generally dashing New Women. Nationwide, the militant Industrial
Workers of the World were fighting a series of violent labor
battles; the intellectuals among the Wobblies, as the union members
were called, stopped off in the Village for rest and recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elsewhere . . . barriers went down, and people reached each
other who had never been in touch before,'' exulted Mabel Dodge,
the Buffalo heiress whose salon provided material and spiritual
stimulation for the many restless and needy spirits of the new
bohemia. Dodge arrived in Manhattan after years of sumptuous living
in a Florentine villa.
</P>
<P>
   She had grown tired, however, of the languorous expatriate life,
and she was on the lookout for something vital. Rich as she was,
Dodge could have moved uptown and established herself as a patron
of the arts: she did indeed make a name for herself as an organizer
of the 1913 International Exhibition of Modern Art, the scandalous
blockbuster Armory show that was New York's first look at Europe's
most advanced art. But Dodge sensed more potent possibilities
downtown and set herself up in a luxurious apartment at 23 Fifth
Ave., just north of Washington Square and the Hotel Brevoort, a
bohemian gathering place for late-night discussions, celebrations
of literary and painterly successes and trysts.

 &HT;    Still the Girls, but these are women with a history

<P>
   Like the oppressive summer heat and the brilliant white dogwoods
of spring, it's hard to imagine Atlanta without Amy Ray and Emily
Saliers, aka the Indigo Girls.
</P>
<P>
   The socially conscious singer-songwriters have been an integral
part of Atlanta's music scene for nearly 15 years. Though they've
been a nationally successful act since the late 1980s, Saliers and
Ray have remained in the Atlanta area, where they enjoy a loyal and
supportive fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep us going,'' says Saliers, 37, even if airplay is
scarce these days. Modern rock radio, she says, is too homogenized.
``It's all guy bands. They play No Doubt and that's it. I like to
hear diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of radio support, Saliers professes to be happy
with the level of success she and Ray have achieved. ``I get to
play music for a living and then I get to come home to Atlanta, my
beautiful city. I'd rather do this than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   When not performing, they lend their celebrity to many causes.
Among the groups that Saliers and Ray support are Honor the Earth
Campaign, which raises funds and awareness of environmental issues,
and Youth Pride, an Atlanta-based support organization for gay and
lesbian youth.
</P>
<P>
   INDIGO GIRLS TIME LINE
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two decades together, the pair has achieved a
number of milestones. Here are some highlights:

   &QR;  1964: Amy Ray born April 12.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Circa 1973: Saliers and Ray meet while attending Laurel Ridge
Elementary School. ( Saliers: ``We met in elementary school when we
were 9 or 10 years old. We started playing while we were in high
school. I've known Amy for almost 30 years now.'')
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1981: Saliers and Ray play for their first audience _ their
high school English class. (Saliers: ``We were real excited about
it. It was great to have an audience.'')

We were actually up for best new artist, too, and Milli Vanilli
won.'')

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  September 1999: ``Come on Now Social'' is released.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  February 2000: Ray has an emergency appendectomy. Doctors

 NEW YORK: and trysts.

</P>
<P>
   Dodge, with the help of new bohemian friends, issued a bountiful
invitation to a jumble of Villagers to join her in weekly
``evenings.'' There was a touch of the aristocratic salon in the
opulent antique furniture and the sumptuous buffet. Yet Dodge's
passion was not cultivated conversation but free speech, the
left-wing political cause of the moment that was also the left-wing
cultural cause.
</P>
<P>
   Because the censorship laws of the time were tied up with the
repression of radicalism in both politics and art, the battle for
bold, honest, forthright truth-telling allied soapbox rabblerousers
to birth-control advocates to modern artists. Walter Lippmann came
from the Olympian precincts of The New Republic to partake of the
free-speech evenings, and so did the anarchist leader Emma Goldman,
the birth-control activist Margaret Sanger, and the French painter
Jean Crotti (newly arrived from a Europe being ravaged by World War
I and, like many fellow Parisian expatriates, besotted with the
energy of Manhattan).
</P>
<P>
   They all crowded into Dodge's Italianate rooms to shock, argue,
debate and persuade. The assortment of people was extraordinary:
feminists, poets, psychoanalysts, newspapermen, novelists,
anarchists, painters, critics and labor organizers. The thread that
held them together was the impulse to smash the conventions of
their country and remake it with revolutionary ardor.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere in the Village, free speech defined bohemian
sophistication _ bounding from one subject to another,
ostentatiously eclectic, touching on politics and art one moment
and churning up neighborhood gossip the next, always edged with a
sexual raciness that was taboo in polite society. The impulse was
to set up frames for the random talk and the heterogeneous talkers,
as if the principles of modernist collage with which Braque and
Picasso were experimenting at the moment in Paris had traveled to
New York to become embedded in montages of talk.
</P>
<P>
   There was a supper club for free-speech conversation in Patchin
Place, where the brilliant political essayist Randolph Bourne
joined feminist friends one night to hear Carl Jung describe his
dream psychology. Patchin Place, a tiny gloomy court in the shadow
of Jefferson Market Courthouse, once conveniently abutted by the
Women's House of Detention, might have seemed like a London
rookery; electricity, running water and indoor toilets were
lacking.
</P>
<P>
   But the newest of the Village's New Women gravitated there _
among them Bryant and the writer Djuna Barnes _ to paint their
castoff furniture in screaming Fauve colors and join an excited
collective life that spilled over from one apartment to the next.
</P>
<P>
   The principle of tolerance reigned, an activist tolerance that
threw up a banner of welcome to out-of-the-ordinary encounters and
challenging ideas. When the local, genteel Liberal Club in 1912
balked at admitting Goldman and the historian W.E.B. Dubois (who
had come to the Village from Atlanta to edit the recently founded
NAACP's journal) on the grounds of politics (Goldman) and race
(Dubois), the bohemian cadre bolted and set up their own
insistently bohemian Liberal Club at 137 Macdougal St. in a
ramshackle old row house.
</P>
<P>
   The new club blossomed with conviviality, come-hither
sociability, emancipated talk and liberated sex. The decor stressed
the differences of this ``new'' club for men and women from the
Victorian gentlemen's or ladies' club: no William Morris wallpaper
or deep upholstered furniture. Instead, there were bare wood floors
and tables, Cubist and Fauve art on the walls, chairs painted in
fiery Futurist oranges and acid yellows. The clientele included
young women from the heartland who had fled their families, Jewish
socialists, left-leaning lawyers, at least one Princeton dropout
(the playwright Eugene O'Neill), the golden young Harvard men like
Reed and Lippmann, theater people, journalists, poets _ both famous
and aspiring _ ``all the tin pot revolutionaries and sophomoric
advanced thinkers in New York,'' the curmudgeonly newspaperman H.L.
Mencken _ definitely not in their circle _ dubbed them.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd gathered in the late afternoons and stayed on,
talking, drinking, dancing to the player piano (not mannerly
waltzes but the Turkey Trot and the shimmy), drifting downstairs
for a meal at Polly Holladay's restaurant or a visit to the Boni
Brothers' bookstore next door at No. 135, then back upstairs to
listen to talks that ranged from disquisitions on the tango to
reports of the latest battle on the labor front. Love affairs
materialized and spouses cast off familiar roles to flirt, dance
and talk as comrades, friends and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   This bohemia was in-dwelling and self-dramatizing _ literally
so, since the Liberal Club's drama group put the membership's own
psychosexual dilemmas onstage in amateur theatricals that coalesced
into the Provincetown Playhouse, at 139 Macdougal St., which stayed
in place as a professional company after the club and its bohemian
theater had folded.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1916, the Provincetown Players began performing
on Cape Cod, where a number of Villagers were vacationing.
Returning to New York, the Players set themselves up in a complex
of buildings on Macdougal Street that grew out of the Liberal Club.
The group would produce several of O'Neill's plays.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jewish radicals drifted over from the nearby Lower East
Side with its own lively cultural scene and commingled with the
Village bohemians. One of them, the firebrand Emma Goldman, held
forth to American artists and theater critics at Justus Schwab's
saloon at 51 First St. and turned herself from an anarchist
political leader into a downtown celebrity.

 NEW YORK: downtown celebrity.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   East of Cooper Square, the Lower East Side and the Village
leached into each other. Immigrant radicals and artists gathered
for adult education at the anarchist Ferrer Center (which moved
from 6 St. Marks Place to 104 E. 12th St.), ambled back and forth
to the Liberal Club and even attended Dodge's tony evenings;
Village bohemians trekked over to East 12th Street to lecture to
working-class audiences.
</P>
<P>
   There were departures as well. Emmanuel Radnitsky, who would
soon rename himself Man Ray, moved from the Village across the
Hudson to found an artists' colony in a flimsy collection of shacks
on the Palisades near Ridgefield, N.J., taking with him an
assortment of Village and Ferrer writers, painters and poets. Soon,
Marcel Duchamp, another arrival from Paris, would join this Bohemia
West and turn it into the hot spot of New York Dada, its antic
proclamations issued by the marvelously titled broadsheet The
Ridgefield Gazook.
</P>
<P>
   None of this would last long. Once the new subway stop at
Sheridan Square was completed in 1917, tourists and uptown visitors
flooded in, flush with World War I cash and hungry for the
forbidden pleasures that bohemia supposedly provided. Real estate
agents, now alert to the value of crumbling houses that could be
subdivided infinitely into authentic ``artists' studios,''
ratcheted up the rents. Village conversation, always tending to the
left, was suspect _ even illegal _ under the repressive
anti-radical wartime laws the government instituted. Writers found
themselves subject to arrest and trial for ``seditious'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   While some people were in court, others turned into marketable
parodies of themselves. A new class of ``authentic'' bohemian
guides escorted visitors to ``real'' Village hideaways, like the
Bruno's Garret, run by the local entrepreneur Guido Bruno, at 58
Washington Square South, where down-and-out women impersonated
poets and artists' models.
</P>
<P>
   The ``real'' bohemia, the Old Guard lamented, was gone,
displaced by the real estate men, newcomers battened on uptown
money, the would-be's and the fakes. The very jeremiads they
unleashed would prove to be one of their enduring achievements as,
over time, a succession of bohemias would unfurl on the original
spot, each holding the stage a moment, then sputtering out, giving
way to sponsors of an even newer ``new.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1919 on, the real Village has been ever elusive and
lamented, lingering in memory as the moment before the latest
generation of usurpers took over.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   THE REAL BOHEMIA
</P>
<P>
   Salons and Saloons &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are the historical sites discussed in the article on
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   CORNELIA STREET, between the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth
Avenue back then) and Bleecker Street. The ambience of the Village
in the teens can best be glimpsed by walking down Cornelia Street,
off the avenue. The area of crooked, congested streets was
considerably larger and less commercialized in those days, before
Sixth and Seventh Avenues were cut through.
</P>
<P>
   MABEL DODGE'S APARTMENT, 23 Fifth Ave. This was at the eastern
nexus of Village life, near the rooming houses where her friends
the Harvard men lived along the south edge of the square.
</P>
<P>
   FERRER CENTER, 104 E. 12th St. The New York outpost of an
international movement to commemorate Francisco Ferrer, a Barcelona
educator, anarchist and martyr of the left. The group was housed
first at 6 St. Marks Place, just off Third Avenue, then in more
spacious quarters on 12th Street between Third and Fourth Avenues
(now a parking lot).
</P>
<P>
   THE GOLDEN SWAN, northeast corner of Sixth Avenue and Fourth
Street. This long-gone bar, more commonly known as the Hell Hole,
drew the heavy drinkers among the bohemians, most notably O'Neill
and his cronies. Now the site of a bank, it once furnished the
imaginative material for ``The Iceman Cometh.''
</P>
<P>
   THE HOTEL BREVOORT, northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and Eighth
Street. The hotel, on the site now occupied by the Brevoort
apartment house, was a watering hole, gathering spot and trysting
place where bohemian personages lived, ate and caroused.
</P>
<P>
   LIBERAL CLUB, 137 Macdougal St. The ``Meeting Place for Those
Interested in New Ideas,'' as the letterhead read. In 1914 the
walls were broken through to the Boni Brothers bookshop at No. 135
to join the two. Polly Holladay's restaurant was also in the
building.
</P>
<P>
   THE MASSES, 91 Greenwich Ave. Max Eastman's radical monthly was
suppressed in 1918 for its opposition to World War I. Today, its
former site, between West 12th and Bank Streets, is overlapped by
two restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   PATCHIN PLACE can be glimpsed through a gate on 10th Street
between Greenwich Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, its gloomy
exterior much as it was in the 1910s, when its neighbors were the
Women's House of Detention and the Victorian Jefferson Market
Courthouse, now the site of a public library branch.
</P>
<P>
   PROVINCETOWN PLAYHOUSE, 139 Macdougal St. The Playhouse, in the
late teens, became part of the complex that grew out of the Liberal
Club. Christine Ell's restaurant, considered the heir to Polly
Holladay's next door, was on the second floor of No. 139. Together
with the Boni Brothers bookshop at No. 135 and the Liberal Club at
137, this formed a trio of buildings that were knocked down and
rebuilt as an enlarged theater for the Provincetown Players.
</P>
<P>
   JUSTUS SCHWAB'S, 51 First St., between First and Second Avenues.
Emma Goldman set herself up in the anarchist Schwab's saloon just
as the celebrities from the Yiddish theater did in other such
establishments on the Lower East Side. She entertained well-wishers
and visiting revolutionaries here and gave interviews to reporters.
Although No. 51 has been destroyed, the rest of the block is much
as it was in Goldman's day.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON SQUARE. The radical journalist John Reed and his
Harvard friends lived at No. 42, a site now occupied by New York
University on the already raffish southern border of the square _ a
far cry from the fashionable houses that were the setting for Henry
James' novel ``Washington Square,'' remnants of which can still be
seen on the northern edge of the square.

CHINA CONFIRMS VISIT OF NORTH KOREAN LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China and North Korea confirmed Thursday that North
Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, was in Beijing earlier this week for
three days of secret meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was the reclusive Kim's first journey abroad since he
succeeded his father as leader in 1994 and his first visit to China
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old Great Leader, as he is called at home, took
advantage of the rare venture outside his cloistered country to
visit China's leading computer manufacturer, the Legend Group, as
well as the imposing imperial gate at Tiananmen Square, Chinese
officials reported.
</P>
<P>
   Coming just two weeks before Kim's scheduled summit meeting with
South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, the surprise trip appeared to
be aimed at shoring up North Korea's ties with China _ the
economically stricken country's only important ally.
</P>
<P>
   China is anxious to avoid serious instability in the region or a
total collapse of the North Korean government that might draw South
Korean involvement, or perhaps even U.S. troops, to its border. It
has encouraged the North to engage in peace talks and to open its
economy to foreign trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   China fought alongside North Korea against the United States and
South Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War and was long an ally in
communism. But relations became strained in 1992, when Beijing
extended diplomatic recognition to economically thriving South
Korea, and have only slowly recovered.
</P>
<P>
   During Kim's visit, from Monday to Wednesday, he was the guest
of honor at a banquet given by President Jiang Zemin and met
separately with other leaders including Prime Minister Zhu Rongji,
Vice President Hu Jintao and Li Peng, the former prime minister who
now heads the national legislature. Kim was accompanied by several
top military and political officials.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides reached an ``important consensus'' on bilateral
and regional issues of common concern, said a Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman, Zhang Qiyue, Thursday evening, declining to be more
specific. ``Bilateral relations were raised to a new level.''
</P>
<P>
   China also made new promises of food and other aid to ailing
North Korea, Zhang said at a special briefing.
</P>
<P>
   A short announcement Thursday from the official North Korean
news agency _ as in the case of China's issued only after Kim had
completed his overnight train journey and was safely back home _
described an ``unshakeable will'' to develop friendship with China
and also said that ``consensus was reached on all matters
discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's government has recently tried to break out of its
longstanding diplomatic isolation, opening relations with Italy and
Australia and holding talks with Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In footage of their meeting shown on Chinese television Thursday
night, Kim wore a gray Mao-style jacket while Jiang wore a
Western-style suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese spokeswoman declined to explain the extreme secrecy
surrounding the trip, saying, ``We think this is a normal visit.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Chinese officials said privately that the North
Koreans had insisted that the visit be kept secret until Kim's
return to Pyongyang, and they suggested that he was concerned about
his security or the possibility of a coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an indication of possible instability,'' one Chinese
official said, although Kim's activities have long been shrouded in
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   In public, the Chinese were all smiles, stressing that the
long-standing friendship between the two countries had been
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang told his guest that China welcomes the talks between the
North and South Korean leaders scheduled from June 12 to 14 in
Pyongyang, and ``hopes the two sides improve their relationship,''
the New China News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have said in private that they find the North
Koreans unpredictable and frustrating, and too proud to openly
accept Chinese coaching on economics or foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The official accounts Thursday from China seemed intended to
help the North Koreans save face, avoiding any mention of issues
that have strained relations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jiang was quoted as praising North Korea's economic
achievements, even though the country has suffered a severe
economic decline and food shortages that have sent hundreds of
thousands of refugees fleeing into China.
</P>
<P>
   China was angered last year when North Korea tested a long-range
missile, frightening Japan and spurring stronger efforts by Japan
and the United States to develop anti-missile defenses, which China
strongly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, would not say if the
issue had been discussed but restated China's hope of avoiding any
arms race in the region or any proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   China has for years encouraged North Korea to begin opening its
tightly controlled economy, which collapsed after subsidies from
the former Soviet Union ended nearly a decade ago. Officials
refused to say whether Kim made any commitments in that regard,
but, according to official Chinese accounts, Kim praised the
success of economic reforms in China.

MICROSOFT JUDGE WILL POSTPONE FINAL RULING FOR ABOUT A WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust
case agreed Thursday morning to delay his final ruling for about a
week, giving the Justice Department time to reply to Microsoft's
proposal, filed Wednesday, to revise the government's break up
plan.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had planned to
issue his final ruling, widely expected to call for a breakup of
the company, Thursday or Friday. But the Justice Department asked
him Thursday for an opportunity to reply to Microsoft's comments on
the government's remedy proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson gave the government until Monday to respond, and
Microsoft until Wednesday to file a counter response.
</P>
<P>
   In court on May 24, John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, said the
company wanted an opportunity to ``comment on the form of the
proposed decree prior to its entry.'' Lawyers interpreted that to
mean that Microsoft did not intend to make substantive changes.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, the company's response heavily revised the
government proposal _ gutting it, in the view of some government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general proposed
to break Microsoft into two companies. One would hold the Windows
operating systems, the other everything else, including the Office
suite of programs like Word for word processing and Excel for
spreadsheet calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also put in place almost immediately a wide
range of remedies intended to modify Microsoft's conduct while the
breakup is being carried out. Microsoft's comments would delay all
of the remedies and heavily modify most of them.

FORCE

   ALBANY, N.Y.  &Cx1f; _ Former U.S. drug enforcement chief Thomas
Constantine says the key to peace in Northern Ireland will be the
development of a police service ``everyone is comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   Constantine, ``an Irish-American Catholic,'' is in the province
to oversee implementation of peace reforms, including the
transition of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) to the new police
force.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholics are demanding as much change as possible in the
RUC, a predominantly Protestant force hardened by three decades of
strife and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can put together a police service that everyone is
comfortable with, maybe there will be an end to the violence,''
said Constantine, reached by telephone in Belfast Wednesday night
after the announcement of his appointment as oversight commissioner
by Britain's Northern Ireland Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there has been a cease-fire for two years, there have
been two murders just this week,'' he added. ``The situation is
very contentious. Some neighborhoods are fenced off, opposition
flags fly on street poles and various groups don't even talk to
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Constantine, 60, is a former New York State Police
superintendent who last spring retired as head of the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration. He said he would ``monitor and
referee'' the implementation of 175 recommendations resulting from
a two-year independent study of police reform by Chris Patten, the
last colonial governor of Hong Kong and now a European Union
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations cover assorted police issues, including
hiring, training, communications, finance, human rights,
construction of police academies and information systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report called for an independent from outside England and
Ireland to serve as oversight commissioner,'' Constantine said.
``Conditions here are very sensitive because four or five parties
have different ideas. I won't become involved in politics or the
running of police operations,'' Constantine said.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine, who is from Schenectady, N.Y., was asked to serve
for five years, but he agreed to a three-year commitment. ``I
accepted three years, and then we'll see what develops,'' he said.
He will travel to Ireland four or five times a year, staying on the
job for two weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine is expected to discuss the pace of police reform
with senior Northern Ireland officials and issue public reports,
starting in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being Irish was certainly a part of my decision to take the
assignment, but more importantly family members urged me on,
insisting that I could not turn down people who were calling me.''
</P>
<P>
   Constantine said police reform, if successful, can be a
significant contribution to problem solving. He called the
undertaking a one-time opportunity to resolve a very difficult
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very familiar with all aspects of police work, but this is
a very challenging assignment. I'll be putting in 15 or 16 hours a
day because I have a lot to learn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an incredible 30-year period of violence,
during which the people have suffered greatly. People have been
courageous and they are making strides, but it's too early to say
if this new program will be successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As oversight commissioner Constantine will also be required to
hold periodic public hearings to evaluate the implementation
progress and report findings to the British Parliament and the
Northern Ireland secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine was appointed a professor at the State University of
New York at Albany and has been operating a private law enforcement
consulting firm since his retirement from the DEA a year ago.

   A native of Buffalo, he moved to Schenectady in 1970. He and his
wife, Ruth Ann, have six children, including Lt. Thomas Constantine
of the Niskayuna (N.Y.) Police Department and Kevin Constantine, an
FBI agent in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He was DEA director for five years. Prior to that he was a
member of the Erie County Sheriff's Department for two years and
put in 30 years with the State Police. He rose through the ranks
from uniformed trooper to superintendent, a position he held for
eight years.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's always high noon on a bright June day in the
well-tailored Paris suburb of Argenteuil. Or so one gathers from
the pearly exhibition titled ``The Impressionists at Argenteuil''
at the National Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The show is, of course, the umpteenth repackaging of an
evergreen late-19th-century painting style. But scolding this art
for being popular is by now a cliche in itself. Better to give it a
fresh squint, admiring its manifest beauties but also suggesting
what made it daring in its day and what can make it a complex
experience still.
</P>
<P>
   This is what, in a quiet way, the Washington exhibition does. As
organized by Paul Hayes Tucker, it takes 50 or so works by familiar
figures _ Monet, Renoir, Sisley _ and passes them through an
astringent solution of social and personal history, focusing on a
single place where these artists spent some of their most
innovative and prolific years.
</P>
<P>
   Argenteuil, a few miles from Paris, was a bourgeois town of a
few thousand people when Monet moved there in 1871. Known for its
gypsum deposits, asparagus beds and a cheap, bad wine, it was built
on the banks of the Seine at a point where the river widened and
deepened, making it an ideal site for both industry and aquatic
sports. (It was famous for its sailing regattas.)
</P>
<P>
   To Monet, who had spent the previous year in England to escape
the Franco-Prussian War, it seemed like a little paradise. He was
31 when he arrived with his wife, Camille, and their young son. His
reputation as a vanguard painter was secure. He had money in his
pocket from painting sales. He was ready to settle down.
</P>
<P>
   And Argenteuil seemed like the place to do it. It was quiet and
verdant but a quick train ride from Paris; village-cozy but also
urbane and entrepreneurial. Monet saw himself as a landscape
painter of the modern world, and the right balance of ingredients,
old and new, was here: glorious river views criss-crossed by
railroad bridges, horizon lines broken by smokestacks and church
steeples.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he saw seemed to enchant him. He painted the town's
main commercial strip, standing in the middle of the street to do
so, and depicted the scaffolding of a reconstructed highway bridge
with an engineer's precision. He captured strollers along the Seine
in early summer, then turned his attention to the lush garden in
his own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest garden painting, from 1872, is a kind of controlled
delirium, as if fragrance had somehow been mixed with pigment.
Lilacs are in flower, the pink blossoms so profuse that leaves are
barely visible. Two figures sit on the grass. The one in white is
Camille, who is knitting; the other, a woman in a butter-yellow
gown, holds a parasol against the noon sun. The scene is a triumph
of suburban well-being. It is also a magical, Watteauvian place,
where a patch of blue sky descends to caress the hem of a dress.
</P>
<P>
   Camille appears again in a sumptuous portrait by Renoir. Here
she is indoors reading, but still in garden mode, surrounded by
pillows covered in a splashy floral print fabric. Renoir was one of
several painters (Sisley was the first) who visited the Monet home,
which functioned as a kind of Impressionist headquarters. He stayed
for long stretches, working side by side with his host. Other
artists, like Pissarro and Cezanne, made only brief appearances.
The aggressively bourgeois Argenteuil just wasn't their scene.
</P>
<P>
   And Manet showed up. A celebrity and a confirmed urbanite, he
realized that his younger colleagues were taking art in new
directions, and he didn't want to be left behind. Reigning in his
natural competitiveness, he followed Monet's plein-air lead, and
the results, as seen in the show, were memorable.
</P>
<P>
   The iconic, erotically charged ``Boating,'' painted, or at least
begun, at Argenteuil, is here. So is a large oil sketch of Monet
and Camille on loan from the Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart. Can
anything personal be read into the fact that her features are
deftly notated while her husband's are rendered as a defacing
smear? Apparently not: Manet gave the sketch to Monet, who
treasured it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was Gustave Caillebotte. A boating fanatic who
bought a home across the river from Argenteuil, he was best known
in his day as a collector: the Impressionist paintings he owned now
form the core holdings of the Musee d'Orsay. But he was also an
artist, and an interesting one.
</P>
<P>
   He was a funny sort of Impressionist. By inclination a
figurative painter, he carried his feel for solid forms into
landscapes. When he depicts the shadow of a bridge on water, it has
the heft of an iron bar. In his near-abstract painting ``Yellow
Fields at Gennevilliers,'' beds of flowers lie side by side like
deep-pile carpets.
</P>
<P>
   No two pieces by him in the show look alike, but none could have
been done by anyone else. It's as if some resistance to
Impressionism's dematerializing impulse made his engagement with
the style an experiment every time. In his wonderful picture of the
Paris newspaper editor Richard Gallo walking by the Seine with a
poodle, the two sides of his art come together yet remain distinct.
The water reflections are all pure Impressionist scintillation. But
Gallo, in his dark coat and bowler, is solid as a rock.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Caillebotte painted this picture in 1884, Monet was
long gone from the area. After a few rapturous years, his attitude
toward Argenteuil had soured. The air of progress he once found
stimulating had become an irritant. Tourism and industry, heavily
promoted, were increasing. The population was becoming working
class.
</P>
<P>
   In 1874 he depicted the town's new railroad bridge as if it were
a Greek temple, its massive supports crisp, white and majestic. But
gradually he turned to more escapist, pastoral subjects. The
parklike setting in ``Ball-Shaped Tree, Argenteuil'' (1876), for
example, an exotic salad of lavender, orange and green, might have
come from Fragonard.
</P>
<P>
   During his early days, he often recorded the dynamic riverside
scene with its smoke-spewing factories and day-tripping ladies and
gents from inside a covered boat he used as a floating studio. This
is where Manet sketched him, in the modern thick of things, looking
dapper and larky in a straw hat and a billowy shirt. In 1874 Monet
himself painted the boat. Moored offshore in still water, it looks
like a hermit's retreat, fragile and somewhat forlorn.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, the artist stuck to his garden, and in
``Argenteuil, the Bank in Flower'' (1877) he envisions the town as
a distant hallucination, steaming away in a hot summer glow and
viewed from behind the protective barrier of a hedge of flowers. A
year later, he moved out, first to Vetheuil, then farther on to
Giverny, some 40 miles from Paris, where he lived in a vegetative
Eden of his own making until he died.
</P>
<P>
   Monet's retreat is in some sense our retreat at the beginning of
the 21st century; his conflicted view of the world is our view,
too. We love his paintings for their reassurances that the material
world is real, and enough, and belongs to us. And we're grateful
for what they don't say, at least on the surface, about
disintegration, darkness, things ending.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Impressionism was thinking about all of these things
_ the frozen sun-drenched moment, the clock moving past the hour _
all the time, just as we are. Each intelligent new presentation,
and the Washington show is one, reveals this art's depths along
with its pleasures. Surely that's why we keep coming back for more.
</P>

   NEW YORK _ Unless there are some major surprises _ and there
always are _ on Sunday night, Tony voters will declare that
Broadway's best musical is ``Contact,'' which many people say is
not a musical, and that its best play is ``Copenhagen,'' which many
people say they simply don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? You should be.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that kind of year on Broadway, an odd mishmash of
daring new work and lukewarm fare that has left theater
professionals searching for a cohesive theme.
</P>
<P>
   All that confusion should end on Sunday, however, with the
broadcast of the Tony Awards, Broadway's annual rite of
self-congratulation, self-flagellation and, occasionally, even
real, genuine drama. The awards, overseen by the American Theater
Wing and the American League of Theaters and Producers, represent
the single occasion during the year when the theater's reach
extends past the footlights and across the nation, creating a
window of televised visibility when all the winners are superstars
for as long as it takes to thank their parents and their pets.
</P>
<P>
   In the ceremony at Radio City Music Hall, 21 awards will be
handed out: 12 during the high-profile CBS broadcast starting at 9
p.m., and nine others during an earlier portion that will be
broadcast on PBS. CBS will handle the big awards, like best musical
and best play, as well as those for revivals and all eight acting
categories. PBS will televise the design, direction and special
awards.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell is back as host and an executive producer of the
show, bringing with her the hope that the telecast will rebound
from last year's dismal ratings. Her presence may provide a spark
of life in a show whose 1999 incarnation could have been titled
``Night of 1,000 Unhappy Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Tony officials are promising that
production numbers from all the nominated musicals will make it on
the air. Last year the show ran long, and a number from ``It Ain't
Nothin' but the Blues'' was canceled at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``My absolute prediction?'' said Jed Bernstein, president of the
league. ``The show will end at 11 o'clock on the dot, and every
nominated musical will have been on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond a few major categories, any solid predictions may be
foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
   While the season's creative ups and downs may have caused
concern about Broadway's future _ new plays, anyone? _ the lack of
a single blockbuster is creating some highly competitive Tony
races, in categories from best revival of a play, in which Tom
Stoppard's ``Real Thing'' is head to head with Eugene O'Neill's
``Moon for the Misbegotten''; to best actress, in which the
downtown newcomer Claudia Shear (``Dirty Blonde'') may just snag an
award over several of her more Broadway-tested colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   And while the theater aficionado will certainly pay closer
attention than the layman, even a casual viewer can see the
potential drama in races that pit mother against daughter (Rosemary
Harris of ``Waiting in the Wings'' and Jennifer Ehle of ``The Real
Thing'' for best actress in a play), ``brother'' versus ``brother''
(Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly of ``True West'' for
best actor in a play) and Susan Stroman against herself in two
categories (best choreography and best direction of a musical, for
``Contact'' and ``The Music Man'').
</P>
<P>
   HEAVY FAVORITES
</P>
<P>
   In an informal poll of 20 producers, press agents, nominees and
other Broadway eggheads, only a few sure things seem to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   One of those locks seems to be on the evening's big prize, best
musical.
</P>
<P>
   Despite protests from Local 802, the Broadway musicians' union,
that ``Contact'' does not adhere to the standards of a traditional
musical because it has no orchestra or original score, the show
remains an overwhelming favorite to win, in the minds of those
polled. The producers of ``The Wild Party,'' ``Swing!'' and ``James
Joyce's `The Dead''' may not have to worry about drafting
acceptance speeches; not one of the 20 voters thought any of these
shows would win.
</P>
<P>
   The same story for the award for best play. ``Copenhagen,''
Michael Frayn's heady exploration of a critical moment in the lives
of two famous physicists, is a near-unanimous choice, even though
few of those asked could give a full explanation of what the drama
was all about. ``Dirty Blonde,'' Shear's affectionate look at Mae
West, is a long shot, some said, but lacks what one voter called
``the snob factor.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Copenhagen' makes you feel smarter for having seen it,''
said one producer, who, like all of the prognosticators, spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``Even if you don't really understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' which leads all shows, with
12 nominations, can probably breathe a little easier. The show,
which had late competition from ``The Music Man'' for the award for
best revival of a musical, was an overwhelming favorite of those
polled. ``Kate'' also looks strong in the design categories,
meaning it may lead all shows in total Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   LEADING LIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   In the individual acting categories, too, a couple of performers
appear ready to be anointed.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Stokes Mitchell, who received terrific reviews for his
work in ``Kate,'' is considered a near-certain winner as best
leading actor in a musical. This is in part because of his work in
that show. But it also reflects many voters' opinion that Mitchell
could easily have won in 1998 for ``Ragtime'' but was surprised by
the late-season entry of Alan Cumming, who won for ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's only real competition would seem to be Craig Bierko
(``The Music Man''), but few think his turn as a charming con man
has a real chance.
</P>
<P>
   In the category for leading ladies in musicals, Heather Headley
looks to be headed for her first Tony as well, for the title role
in ``Aida,'' though Marin Mazzie (``Kate'') seems to be gaining
support among those in the Broadway industry who feel bad that she
has yet to win a Tony despite previous nominations for ``Passion''
in 1994 and ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the category which breaks your heart the most,'' said
a producer who is friendly with Mazzie but voting for Headley.
``But Heather is the title character of an enormous show and the
only thing that's great in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, however, the landscape gets murkier, with several
categories that have no clear winner and several nominees in the
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   TIME FOR REDEMPTION
</P>
<P>
   The early awards on PBS, the favorite portion for many industry
types, promise to be heavy on redemption and heartfelt recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The only bet-the-kid's-college-fund lock here is that Stroman
will win for best choreography for ``Contact,'' besting her own
effort on ``Music Man'' and those of Kathleen Marshall (``Kate'')
and Lynne Taylor-Corbett (``Swing!''). In addition to being
mightily talented, Stroman is also extremely well liked in the
business, and this looks to be her night.
</P>
<P>
   She is also favored to win for best direction of a musical. She
is nominated for ``Contact'' and ``Music Man,'' though Michael
Blakemore (``Kate'') may make a run for it. Blakemore, mind you,
will probably have already won one award by this point; he is the
favorite to win best direction of a play, for ``Copenhagen.''
</P>
<P>
   For best score, there are two favorites. The first is ``Aida,''
by Elton John and Tim Rice, which has been shut out of the best
musical category but is nonetheless a commercial hit. The logic for
a win here is that it would allow voters who like the show _
especially those voters from out of town who would like to see it
tour _ to express their support.
</P>
<P>
   The other option seems to be ``The Wild Party,'' by Michael John
LaChuisa, which probably won't win best musical but is more
aesthetically ambitious than the sugar-pop score for ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   For best book, opinion seemed to be coalescing around the script
for ``James Joyce's `The Dead,''' adapted by Richard Nelson, which
would once again prove the value of choosing the right source
material. ``Contact,'' with a book by John Weidman, is also a
contender, with a few voters favoring ``Wild Party.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real races will begin with the national broadcast on
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most contested categories will probably be best
revival of a play, in which voters were evenly split between ``A
Moon for the Misbegotten'' and ``The Real Thing.'' (The other two
nominees, ``Amadeus,'' and ``The Price,'' registered nary a vote.)
</P>
<P>
   Here the voters are divided by a certain mild jingoism _
``Moon'' is an American production, while ``Real Thing'' is a
British import _ and a sense that a revival should involve
something, well, dead.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Real Thing' is only 15 years old,'' said one agent,
noting that he had a client in the 1984 Broadway production.
``O'Neill has that certain back-from-the-grave gravitas.''
</P>
<P>
   Another voter added, `` `Moon' seems the kind of thing Broadway
should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, several voters thought ``Real Thing'' might have a slight
edge by dint of an even more powerful phenomenon: O'Neill fatigue.
In particular people mentioned last year's acclaimed four-hour
production of ``The Iceman Cometh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People still remember `Iceman,' and they remember it was
loooong,'' a nonprofit producer said. `` `The Real Thing' is
contemporary and easier to sit through.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise the leading men in both of those productions, Gabriel
Byrne in ``Moon'' and Stephen Dillane in ``Real Thing,'' look to be
neck and neck for the best actor.
</P>
<P>
   The dark horse in the race is Philip Seymour Hoffman, the rising
film actor whose well-received turn in ``True West'' has only
gilded his reputation. The other two nominees are John C. Reilly,
another hot movie talent who alternates roles with Hoffman in
``West,'' and David Suchet, who played the gloomy Salieri in the
closed revival of ``Amadeus.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win? Pushed to answer, a majority said Dillane would
carry the day, despite Byrne's name recognition from films.
</P>
<P>
   `IT'S WIDE OPEN'
</P>
<P>
   Leading actress in a play is an even tighter category, with five
talented performers in the mix: Ehle, Harris, Shear (``Dirty
Blonde''), Cherry Jones (``Moon'') and Jayne Atkinson (``The
Rainmaker'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard every option,'' one producer said. ``It's wide
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping this race is a process of elimination, voters say.
Atkinson's show is long closed, so scratch her. Ehle is young;
she'll have her day. (Just not this Sunday.)
</P>
<P>
   That leaves her mother, Harris, the older, sentimental choice;
Jones, the Broadway insider choice; and Shear, the populist choice.
</P>
<P>
   While Jones has an edge in the informal tally, the race seems
primed for an upset from Shear.
</P>
<P>
   A chatty, amiable sort, she has been active in interviews and
pre-Tony promotional events. Voters also say that a nod for Shear
here may be a way of acknowledging her other work on ``Dirty
Blonde,'' which she also wrote; conceived with the show's director,
James Lapine; and practically dragged to Broadway from a run
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't win best play,'' one voter said, ``but she could be
given a nod here to say, `Good work, come again.'''
</P>
<P>
   She also has a potential block of votes behind her from the
Shubert Organization, Broadway's largest theater owner and a
principal producer of ``Dirty Blonde.''
</P>
<P>
   CLASH OF CHARACTERS
</P>
<P>
   One of Shear's co-stars, Kevin Chamberlin, who plays a
cross-dressing Mae West fan, is in the running for best featured
actor. His principal competition is the respected English actor Roy
Dotrice, who plays the crotchety father in ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten.''
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case, the winner will be determined by how
voters choose between two of Broadway's favorite gestures: the
crowning of a new star (i.e., Chamberlin) or the recognition of a
veteran talent (the 77-year-old Dotrice).
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll suggests Dotrice has a slight edge, but one press
agent not connected to the show insisted that Chamberlin had the
race in the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The costume.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to win and you're a man,'' said the press agent,
``put on a dress.'' As evidence, he cited Harvey Fierstein, a
winner for ``Torch Song Trilogy,'' in 1983, and George Hearn,
victorious in drag in ``La Cage aux Folles'' in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Other supporting categories have strong favorites. Blair Brown
is widely expected to be named best featured actress in a play
(``Copenhagen''), though the award would also seem to reflect her
earlier _ and unnominated _ work in ``The Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER GOLDEN RULE
</P>
<P>
   For featured actor and actress in a musical, most voters liked
Boyd Gaines and Deborah Yates (the Girl in the Yellow Dress) in
``Contact.'' But Yates can expect some strong competition from her
co-star Karen Ziemba and Eartha Kitt, generally considered one of
the few stand-out elements about the Public Theater's ``Wild
Party.'' One theory holds that Ziemba and Yates will split the
``Contact'' coalition, allowing Kitt to take the prize.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gaines wins and Ziemba or Yates carries the day, it could
be the perfect overture to a probable win for ``Contact'' as best
musical. Such a victory would probably cause ever more hand
wringing by theater people but would also adhere to one of
Broadway's golden rules.
</P>
<P>
   As one producer put it: ``Whatever leaves them clapping and
coming back for more, that's the best musical on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   YOUR BOX SEAT

   The Tony Awards ceremony at Radio City Music Hall will be
broadcast live on Sunday night. The first hour, from 8 to 9 p.m.,
will be broadcast by PBS (Channel 13 in New York). From 9 to 11

FORD ADDS TO WARRANTY ON ENGINE GASKET FLAW 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHERYL JENSEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that consumer advocates say could benefit owners of
all brands of vehicles, Ford Motor Co. has agreed to cover
head-gasket repairs for some rear-wheel-drive cars with the
3.8-liter V-6 engine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ford had announced in February that it would pay for repairs on
about 718,000 front-drive automobiles with that engine: the 1994-95
Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, the 1994 Lincoln Continental and the
1995 Ford Windstar. But the rear-drive cars _ Cougars, Mustangs and
Thunderbirds from the 1994-95 model years _ were excluded. Some
consumers were stuck with bills ranging from $1,600 for gasket
repairs to $4,000 for destroyed engines.
</P>
<P>
   Ford changed its mind this spring, saying it now realizes that
owners of those cars were also having problems. It is extending the
head-gasket warranty on about 294,000 rear-drive cars and
reimbursing owners who already paid for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   A head gasket is a thin seal between the engine block and the
cylinder head; if it fails, coolant can leak out or seep into
mechanical components, potentially causing total engine failure.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Edmonston, author of the annual ``Lemon-Aid Car Guide,''
said Ford's action was important to owners of other makes because
it reinforced the idea that engines should not suffer major defects
for at least seven years or 100,000 miles. General Motors and
Toyota have offered similar special policies to cover head-gasket
defects.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonston, who also has a Web site, www.lemonaidcars.com, said
that having such a ``durability parameter'' would give consumers
who have problems with other cars ammunition to use in small-claims
court or in negotiations with car companies. In addition, Ford's
action puts pressure on other automakers to follow suit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One company that could feel such pressure is DaimlerChrysler.
Some of its 2-liter, 4-cylinder engines have also had head-gasket
problems, which the company is covering on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   Under its new policy, Ford will extend to seven years or 100,000
miles, whichever comes first, the warranty on the head gaskets on
the 3.8-liter V-6 in '94-'95 models. The normal warranty is 3 years
or 36,000 miles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The automaker will also reimburse consumers who had those
repairs done, even if the work was not done by a Ford dealer, a
company spokesman, Mike Vaughn, said. There is no limit on the
repair cost, and Ford will pay if a new engine was required. The
policy also covers owners of used cars.
</P>
<P>
   The letter being sent to consumers will tell those who already
paid for repairs how they can apply for a refund. Those who
purchased the vehicles used and do not receive a letter should
contact a Ford dealer.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford is taking a Band-Aid approach to it,'' said Clarence M.
Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety. ``They put on one Band-Aid to
see if it would stop the bleeding. It didn't. Now they put on
another one, a bigger Band-Aid. But what they need to do is have a
comprehensive program.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Ford should have extended the warranty to 120,000 miles,
``which is the average useful life of a vehicle today,'' and should
have covered models predating 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ditlow and Edmonston want Ford to include '93 cars; Ditlow said
he thought the problem dated as far back as '88 models. Vaughn said
records showed there was no problem with earlier vehicles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although he urged Ford to cover '93 models, Edmonston said the
company was responding in a generous, timely manner. He said
DaimlerChrysler should do the same on 2-liter engines in the
1995-99 Neon, Dodge Stratus, Plymouth Breeze, Dodge Avenger and
Chrysler Sebring. The problems are being dealt with on a
case-by-case basis; the company has not extended the warranty.
</P>
<P>
   A DaimlerChrysler spokesman, Mike Aberlich, said all owners were
not being notified because ``it does not appear to be a universal
problem.'' He added: ``That's not to say that we might not decide
to do something in the future. We are still watching and analyzing
it.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aberlich said DaimlerChrysler was reimbursing consumers for
out-of-warranty repairs on a case-by-case basis when they called
the company's toll-free assistance number _ (800) 992-1997 or went
to dealerships. He said the dealers would consider factors
including whether there was any evidence that the vehicle was
abused. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One problem with DaimlerChrysler's policy is that owners who
figure their warranty no longer applies and go to an independent
repair shop instead of to a dealer might lose a chance for eventual
reimbursement. ``They are penalized,'' Edmonston said. &QL;

the same way . . . from the players (Rocker aside) who are class

   BBO-BRAVES-YANKEES _ ATLANTA _ Perhaps it's no secret why the
Braves and Yankees have been the class of baseball during the
1990s. In fact, they are mirror images . . . from the eccentric
owners who, for some reason or another, have stepped into the
shadows . . . from two managers, who seem to handle their players
the same way . . . from the players (Rocker aside) who are class
acts in baseball and bring a great deal of professionalism to the
game on and off the field . . . to the farm-system philosophy.

PATIENT: KNOW THY RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, Congress has passed several laws designed to
help people remain insured when they change jobs, and to obtain
coverage for life-altering medical situations that insurers often
shunned.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, most people pay little attention to what their
rights are in such situations until they need them, and then may be
unaware of the new laws' existence.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Do you know many 25-year-old single men who are deeply obsessed
with the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996? (It
was designed to eliminate what came to be called drive-by births by
mandating that insurers cover minimum hospital stays following
childbirth.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Employers offering health insurance are required by law to keep
their workers abreast of the latest changes in health care law. But
they often go about it in ways that are sure to escape notice.
</P>
<P>
   Annual notices to employees are required for some laws, but a
lot of other important information about health care rights is
buried in what are called summary plan descriptions of benefits
packages, mounds of legalese about as readable as the package
inserts in a Tylenol box. Smaller companies often count on health
maintenance organizations to inform their employees, and HMOs have
been known to fall down on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Taylor, a principal of the Teare Group, a health care and
human resources consultancy, said the first problem involved in
keeping employees informed is that employers often do not
understand what they have to provide in writing. ``The second is
that the employee may not read it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that the Department of Labor, which has
jurisdiction over many of the laws, fields 1,700 calls a week on
health care questions alone. The department has begun to audit
companies to make sure they are giving their workers the necessary
information, especially on the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act, or HIPAA.
</P>
<P>
   Among other provisions, the 1996 law expanded protections for
people with serious medical conditions who change jobs, and it has
helped millions of people, but millions more do not know a thing
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, as long as there has not been a break in health
care coverage of 63 days or more, the waiting periods commonly
imposed before a new employer's health insurance plan will cover
pre-existing conditions can be reduced or eliminated entirely.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, say you have a chronic heart problem and were
treated for it under your former employer's health plan, but your
new employer's plan does not cover pre-existing conditions for the
first year of employment.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of time your condition was covered by your former
employer's plan counts against that waiting period _ if it was at
least a year, coverage under your new plan begins immediately.
(Your former employer is required to give you a certificate proving
prior coverage.) A similar provision applies to new employees'
children with pre-existing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, employers cannot discriminate against workers
because of chronic conditions. For example, ``under HIPAA, you
cannot charge an individual a higher premium just because they have
diabetes,'' said Leslie Kramerich, acting assistant secretary of
the Labor Department unit that oversees pensions and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some employers used to say, `We will let you in, but because
you have diabetes, you have to pay a 40 percent higher premium,' or
they would keep you out, period.''
</P>
<P>
   The law also requires that employees who give birth be permitted
to enroll the baby for coverage immediately, and not have to wait
for the next open enrollment period.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct is that people don't realize how important HIPAA
is,'' said James P. McElligott Jr., a lawyer in Richmond, Va., who
specializes in health care law. ``Today, as a result of HIPAA, if a
child is born to a couple or adopted, that child can have
cradle-to-grave health care coverage no matter what its medical
condition is. That is an enormous change from the way things used
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think your employer has failed to comply with the law, or
you are leaving a job, or you want to understand the basics and the
many exceptions and nuances of HIPAA and other health care laws,
the Department of Labor offers an easy-to-navigate Web site,
www.dol.gov/dol/pwba, with plenty of information. Too much, in
fact: unless you are a policy wonk, I do not recommend clicking and
wading through, say, ``Health Insurance Portability for Group
Health Plans; Interim Rules and Proposed Rule (04/08/1997).''
</P>
<P>
   But documents explaining every twist and turn in health care law
in exhaustive detail are there. Georgetown University also
maintains a Web site for consumers with specifics about the laws
and state-by-state guidelines in modern standard English:
data.georgetown.edu/research/ihcrp/hipaa/.

 &HT;    Eds: Changes throughout
 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Funeral for a mistress; black tie optional
 &HT;    For release June 4, 2000.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The lady wrote in earnest. She had been to the funeral
of her husband's longtime _ and ``very public'' _ mistress after
debating (a) whether or not to go and (b) what to wear. In
retrospect now, she wondered in writing not about her presence at
the funeral but of her attire.
</P>
<P>
   In her query to the Miss Manners-type columnist for The Weekend
Times of London, Mrs. Name and Address Withheld asked if her choice
of navy blue was appropriate inasmuch as it wasn't mourning black
or celebratory white.
</P>
<P>
   The response was more astonishing than the request; it, too, was
sincere: a delicate grey would have been the ideal shade, wrote the
man from the Weekend Times. There also was the mild, almost
obligatory, admonishment: ``How brave, if inappropriate, of you:
good manners quite excuse a wife's attendance at such events.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Name and Address, of course, was breaking no new ground in
attending the a tryst-tainted farewell. Did not the widow of French
President Francois Mitterand acquiesce to a graveside appearance by
her late husband's mistress as well?
</P>
<P>
   The table had been set for such attendances, what we were
dealing with in this most recent event was attire. Despite her
choice of navy blue, the letter writer complained, ``all eyes
present still switched from the deceased to me,'' thus prompting
her letter to the newspaper as to whether she had the appropriate
wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   I would have considered that a triumph, not an embarrassment. To
have the old mistress not be the center of the show at her own
funeral should have been celebrated as retribution. I'd have worn a
Hawaiian shirt and white shorts!
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how the world is turning. It is almost acceptable on the
European side of the Atlantic that mistresses are a tolerable part
of daily life. Yes, there is some grousing but reality is reality
to Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the U.S. side, mistresses and other things naughty,
while still raising some apoplectic reaction, are becoming more
common. (We give Europe Starbucks Coffee and McDonald's and they
give us mistress tolerance.)
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Guliani's withdrawal from the U.S. Senate race in New York
was accepted more to be based on his prostate cancer rather than
his fooling around. The tearful discourse by wounded wife Donna
Hanover played a secondary role _ and allowed Rudy to retreat
almost protectively into the empathetic arms of his mistress.
(Mistress number 2, that is.)
</P>
<P>
   Also note how quietly Newt Gingrich recently married the woman
with whom he had an affair to break up his second marriage. We're
sort of getting attuned to these things; certainly not at the
Southern Baptist Conventions but elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at what has filled our plates in recent years: The
chronic Bill Clinton and retrospective revelations about JFK, FDR,
LBJ and Ike as well as the fully-named Henry Hyde, Dan Burton and
Helen Chenoweth. Throw in a male general hitting on a female
general, a school teacher having her student's babies, and a female
Air Force pilot having a verboten penchant for enlisted men, and
we're a nation in transition.
</P>
<P>
   Is there nothing in our lives that does not have a sexual tone
to it? Do we titter or grumble when we read that liver-lipped movie
actress Angelina Jolie calls out for more sex: ``Before I die, I
wanna taste everyone in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what those dozens of betrayed wives will wear when
Angelina is ready to be buried.
</P>
<P>
   Sex sells. It sells in stores, at movie theaters, in books, in
newspapers, on TV, just about anywhere. Some think Americans are
too puritanical. We're not. We just haven't been as public about
it, for fear of what our neighbor will think.
</P>
<P>
   Led by European example, some of those barriers are beginning to
crumble _ not so much by choice but by the simple fact that
everyone now knows everyone else's private business.
</P>
<P>
   And that which we don't know, we always can ask by writing to a
Miss Manners.

TAKING THE CHILDREN

</P>
<P>
   With the voices of D.B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard, Ossie Davis,

</P>
<P>
   Directed by Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton
</P>
<P>
   PG 90 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Gripping a stolen iguanadon egg in its beak, a
computer-generated pterodactyl soars between peaks and over
bottomless chasms. What follows owes much to Steven Spielberg and
Charles Darwin. First, though, comes a serving of Tarzan when the
egg plops into the jungle and the hatchling within is reared by a
family of lemurs to become a sweet-natured creature, Aladar (
Sweeney), several thousand times the size they are.
</P>
<P>
   Devoted to his adoptive family, Aladar still longs for something
bigger. Before long opportunity arrives in a meteor shower and
nuclear-style explosion. In a Disney film that is not a
species-killer, but it does put everybody on the road with a parade
of dinosaurs struggling to reach their Elysian nesting grounds,
which lie a torturous desert or two beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Mesozoic critters of every description are strung out in the
long migration. The biggest is a dowager brachiosaur named Baylene
( Plowright). Eema ( Reese), a weary and testy old styrachosaur, is
more armor-plated, but she and Baylene move slowly, which leaves
them vulnerable to the toothy little raptors trailing the
procession like a Cretaceous pack of dingos.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most vigorous could become the next meal of two
giant carnotaurs, or T. rexes, who shake the ground and bring on
lightning bolts. Eema and Baylene traipse on through scorching,
waterless days but constantly fall behind. That's their problem,
according to Kron ( Wright), the leader of the procession, who has
beaten Darwin to the idea that survival belongs to the fittest.
Fortunately, Aladar has a more enlightened view.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ The carnotaurs, big and as mean as they make them,
chow down on some central characters and continually threaten to
pull tasty morsels out of caves and rock piles where their prey
clings for dear life. Later on Kron's stubborn belligerence leads
to a brawl with Aladar.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ None.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-7 _ Parents know their littlest ones, but some children
will be frightened by the mayhem and upset by the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8 AND UP _ The computerized action placed in real settings
is often quite spectacular. Most children will be engrossed.
</P>
<P>
   M:I-2
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, Richard Roxburgh,
Ving Rhames, Rade Sherbedgia
</P>
<P>
   Directed by John Woo
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 120 minutes
</P>
<P>
   On the airliner headed for Atlanta, the very nervous Dr.
Nekhorvich ( Sherbedgia) tells Dimitri, who looks and sounds
exactly like Tom Cruise, that he feels better having him along on
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor has elected to transport a lethal virus called
Chimera by injecting himself with it and then racing to reach the
antidote before he dies. That shows a whole lot more faith in
airline schedules than most people would have in Nekhorvich's
shoes, but it is academic really because the plane's next stop is
into the side of a mountain. And as it evolves, Dimitri is not
Dimitri or even Cruise. Peeling off a latex mask _ a lot of which
are worn in this movie _ he becomes Hugh Stamp ( Roxburgh).
</P>
<P>
   From here the film gets trickier than the punctuation in its
title. Stamp works for Sean Ambrose ( Scott), an Australian
psychopath who needs control of the virus to swell his
pharmaceuticals portfolio (priorities being what they are these
days). Cruise portrays the agent Ethan Hunt, assigned to get the
stuff back in responsible hands.
</P>
<P>
   Mission: impossible. Might as well give it the old college try,
though, and to help out Hunt signs on a lovely thief named Nyah (
Newton), who was once involved with Ambrose and is now counted upon
to infiltrate her former boyfriend's fortified oceanside compound.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt does not help himself by falling in love with Nyah, which
clouds his focus. Luckily it does not impede his prowess as an
aerialist during a 42nd-floor laboratory break-in or his survival
in the resulting battles by fireball, knife, gun and karate.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ In a John Woo film, virtually nonstop killing and
fighting is graphic but performed in such a stylized manner that
violence often seems unreal if not cornball. (Why does Hunt do
those backflips before landing a blow?)
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ Hunt and Nyah repair to the boudoir, but sexually these
two make an arid pair in a perfunctory cut-to-morning session fit
for a PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ A few expletives.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 11 _ Most parents obviously will not troop the
youngest into this kind of entertainment, but by age 9 or 10,
depending on individual guidelines, there are decisions to be made.
Stylization aside, the film is very violent.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP _ Think you can stop them?
</P>
<P>
   Road Trip
</P>
<P>
   Breckin Meyer, Seann William Scott, Amy Smart, Tom Green, DJ
Qualls, Paulo Costanzo, Rachel Blanchard, Fred Ward, Mia Amber
Davis &QL; 
Directed by Todd Phillips
</P>
<P>
   R 91 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it sounds trashy and dumb, but try to get through this
movie without laughing. At Ithaca College, young Josh ( Meyer)
pines for his childhood sweetheart, Tiffany ( Blanchard), who is at
veterinary school in Austin, Texas. One evening Josh is seduced and
has sex with Beth ( Smart), who decides it would be cute to
videotape everything. Tapes get switched. Instead of a cassette
with Josh strumming a guitar, Tiffany is sent one with Josh in
flagrante delicto.
</P>
<P>
   Josh and friends pile into a car owned by Kyle ( Qualls) and
drive cross-country to intercept the mail. Left back in Ithaca to
feed Josh's python, Barry ( Green) toys with a condemned mouse and,
having mistaken Austin for Boston, sends Beth, who is feeling
betrayed, to the wrong city on a mission of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   On their way to the Lone Star State, the boys wreck Kyle's car,
steal a bus, have a disgusting experience with French toast and
learn a new procedure as donors in a sperm bank. The scrawny Kyle
has a successful sexual initiation with the ample Rhonda ( Davis).
After a riot in an Austin mailroom, they drive home. Oh, and on the
trip Josh is tutored in philosophy. Later he passes his test and he
and Beth sell their tapes on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ The snake never harms the mouse, but on his son's
trail Kyle's father ( Ward) assaults people, including Kyle.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ There is some nudity, and sex acts are performed, albeit
in clearly simulated fashion.
</P>
<P>

ART REVIEW: EVEN THE EGALITARIAN BAUHAUS HAD A HAUSFRAU TENDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exhibition notes are at end of review.) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's always startling to be reminded that the
Bauhaus, that font of modernist invention, did not allow women to
participate in its architecture, wall-painting and furniture
workshops because they were considered too physically demanding.
Such genteel, if chauvinistic, concern seems out of character at a
place where aesthetic equality _ the elevation of craft and design
to fine-art status _ was a founding principle. But no, at the
Bauhaus, women had only gentler options: ceramics, metalwork and
especially the ancient, implicitly female craft of weaving.
</P>
<P>
   Such policies must have saved a lot of breath. After all, the
elevation of craft, or anything else, requires bodies: dedicated
souls willing to learn the basics, bend the rules and inspire
disciples. Surely it was easier to guide women toward the loom en
masse than to convince individual men and women that weaving could
be as expressive and important as any other art, fine or applied.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders if the school's founding fathers fully appreciated
the extent to which the women of the Weaving Workshop proved them
right. Theirs was the only workshop that spanned all of the
Bauhaus' stormy 14-year history, an existence characterized by
financial difficulties, internal discord, physical relocation (from
Weimar to Dessau to Berlin) and an increasingly unsympathetic
political climate. Despite everything, the workshop established the
fundamentals of contemporary textile design and created one of the
most important, if least studied, aspects of the Bauhaus legacy.
</P>
<P>
   This confluence of opposed and dovetailing agendas comes to mind
in the Jewish Museum's illuminating, densely packed survey of the
life and art of Anni Albers, perhaps the most significant member of
the Bauhaus Weaving Workshop. Organized by the Albers Foundation
and the Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice, ``Anni Albers'' is part
art exhibition, part weaving seminar, part biography and altogether
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   It is not without flaws, most notably cramped space compounded
by intrusive display tables that cornily resemble looms. These last
are the salient characteristic of Gae Aulenti's exhibition design;
but while they obstruct the viewing of Albers' handloomed wall
hangings, they efficiently display nearly 100 examples of the
textile samples she designed for possible commercial production.
</P>
<P>
   The show brings together work done over five decades on two
continents in several media. In addition to a broad range of
textiles, it includes gouache and watercolor textile studies,
jewelry and examples of the lithographs to which Albers turned in
the 1960s, somewhat relieved to give up the physical complexities
of the loom. Its driving force is Albers' thorough exploration of
weaving as both a fine and an applied art, her appreciation of the
structural and imagistic possibilities of its basic grid structure
and her sensitivity to the subtleties of texture and color possible
on the loom.
</P>
<P>
   Annelise Fleischmann, born in Berlin in 1900, arrived at the
Bauhaus in 1922. By 1925, she had completed its famous foundation
course, which included color instruction from the mystical Johannes
Itten, and overcome her initial suspicion that weaving was
``sissy.'' She had also married the painter and color theorist
Josef Albers, who was 13 years her senior and the first Bauhaus
student to become a master (as they called teachers). They were
perhaps an unlikely pair: She was the cosseted but artistically
inclined daughter of a Jewish furniture manufacturer in Berlin; he
was from the coal-mining city of Bottrop in the Ruhr, a Catholic
and the son of a skilled laborer who taught him to take pride in
working by hand.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, just after the Nazis closed the Bauhaus for good, the
Alberses were invited by Philip Johnson and Edward M.M. Warburg to
emigrate to the United States, where they continued to spread the
Bauhaus gospel. They spent their first 16 years teaching at Black
Mountain College, the experimental art school in Asheville, N.C. In
1950, they moved to Connecticut, where Josef taught at Yale until
his retirement in 1958. (He died in 1976 at 88, she in 1994 at 94.)
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of the Alberses at home indicate their faithfulness
to Bauhaus simplicity and spareness, even in a small house in
Connecticut. These pictures are part of a personal-history gallery
that includes letters, memorabilia, a selection of the
pre-Columbian textiles that Albers collected (and learned from),
and examples of the Chanel-inspired jackets she made for herself,
as well as curiosities like little squares of corrugated cardboard,
gouged and colored to resemble rough-textured weaving samples, that
she used as teaching aids to sharpen what she called ``tactile
awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   Albers could be as less-is-more and as true to materials as the
next Bauhauslern, as is evinced by the textile samples _ drapery,
upholstery fabric, wall coverings _ that she designed both at the
Bauhaus and in the United States, mostly for Knoll and Sunar. (Some
are still available.) These fabrics give pre-eminence to structure
and materials. Their weaves are often as open and simple as a basic
dishcloth, but Albers also understood the cumulative effect of
little changes, like knots or twists, or irregularities on an
expanse of fabric. Over the years, she experimented with a range of
materials now taken for granted in fabric design _ raffia,
fiberglass, jute, horse hair, harnessmaker's thread, metal thread
and foil, Lurex and plastic. (Their variety would have impressed
Donald Judd, who deeply admired her husband's paintings.)
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of Gunta Stoelzl, her colleague and teacher
at the Bauhaus, Albers began working with cellophane as early as
1929, producing a design for a wall covering for a school
auditorium in Bernau that both absorbed sound and reflected light,
and also earned her her Bauhaus diploma. (A swatch of this material
is in this show and also in ``Making Choices'' at the Museum of
Modern Art, which includes a small but impressive selection of
Albers' work, as well as a handsome wall hanging by Stoelzl.)
</P>
<P>
   It is significant that one of Albers' favorite teachers at the
Bauhaus was Paul Klee. Klee taught a course for weavers only, and
works like Albers' ``Red and Blue Layers'' (1954), which is
actually mostly orange and pink, echo the influence of his vibrant
palette. More important, Klee encouraged his students both to
attend to and take expressive liberties with the implicitly modern
structure of weaving: the grid.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Especially after Albers came to the United States and became
more familiar with pre-Columbian textiles, she introduced
suggestions of landscapes (``Monte Alban,'' 1936) and cityscapes
into her weaving. In some of her most successful pieces, like
``From the East'' and ``Under Way,'' she allowed rogue threads to
wander in a kind of abstract script across the face of a weaving.
In the boldly scaled ``Red Meander,'' this wandering determines the
labyrinthine pattern of the entire weaving.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Albers became the first textile artist to be given a
solo show at the Museum of Modern Art; both her work and her
writings made her revered within the textile field. Today, her work
commands a broader stage. It benefits from heightened attention to
the histories of design and the crafts, including the Weaving
Workshop; increased consciousness of the role of women in the
formation of modernism; and the frequency with which contemporary
art employs fabric, weaving and other kinds of ``women's work.''
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition confirms that Albers is equal in importance to
her husband, both for her work and as a link between European and
American modernisms. It also reveals how perfectly weaving met the
basic conflict, never really resolved, at the heart of the Bauhaus:
between the artist as creative autodidact pursuing personal
expression and the artist as versatile master craftsman, figuring
out ways to use technology to make beautiful everyday objects
available to all. This conflict was never a problem for the
weavers, who pushed their medium toward decoration, abstraction and
function as the situation demanded. No one did this as effortlessly
as Anni Albers. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During previews for ``Copenhagen,'' the playwright
Michael Frayn received a letter from a woman who had just seen it.
``She said that neither she nor anyone she was with liked all the
science in the show,'' Frayn recalled in a recent interview, ``and
that unless I took it out it wasn't going to last long on
Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a great deal of science not to like in
``Copenhagen,'' if that's your inclination, and indeed, anyone
paying attention to word of mouth about the play is sure to hear
complaints that its erudition is off-putting. It is a play, after
all, about nuclear fission, the making of the atomic bomb and the
esoteric concepts _ known as the uncertainty principle and
complementarity _ that are the fundamentals of quantum physics. But
it is also a play about friendship, personal loss, patriotism and
the gravest of moral responsibilities. And, being performed nightly
to full or nearly full houses, it is the favorite to win the Tony
Award for best new play on Sunday. So some people like the science,
or are at least willing to accept it in the service of drama.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting difficult concepts is always risky for a playwright,
but it is particularly so in an era when audiences have been
conditioned by lowbrow entertainment to have their senses tickled
but not to have their brains massaged. As it happens, though,
Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr, the two great physicists that
Frayn resurrects (literally) in ``Copenhagen,'' are not alone in
their challenging speeches or the connections they make between the
mysteries of the universe and the mysteries of the human
experience. Science and scientists have been onstage all over the
place this season.
</P>
<P>
   Off-Broadway, Tina Landau's ``Space,'' which appeared at the
Public Theater last fall, presented astronomers on the lookout for
communication from the far reaches of the galaxy, and last week
``Proof,'' David Auburn's fine new play about the world of higher
mathematics, opened at the Manhattan Theater Club.
</P>
<P>
   Off-off-Broadway, Target Margin Theater presented ``The Five
Hysterical Girls Theorem'' by Rinne Groff, another play trafficking
in the lyrical perplexities of number theory; the Ensemble Studio
Theater staged ``Moving Bodies'' by Arthur Giron, a biography of
the physicist Richard Feynman; and playing now at SoHo Rep is
``Hypatia,'' Mac Wellman's willfully muddling theater tapestry
based on the life and death of the title character, a fifth-century
mathematician and philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   In the wings is a new musical by Joshua Rosenblum and Joanne
Sydney Lessner, also called ``Proof'' _ I saw a staged reading by
the York Theater Company last month _ which is about Andrew Wiles,
the Princeton professor who explained one of mathematics' most
famously lingering enigmas, Fermat's Last Theorem. (It declares
that for integer values of n greater than 2, no whole number
solution exists for xn plus yn equals zn. Can you whistle that
tune?)
</P>
<P>
   And at the Ivanhoe Theater in Chicago, Penny Penniston's ``Now
Then Again,'' a charming if unheralded play about young physicists
in love _ ``Copenhagen'' is not the only show of the season to use
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle metaphorically _ closed on
Sunday after an extended run. Its ingenious structure _ the first
half moves forward to a point in time; the second act moves
backward from the same point, but the events that preceded it have
altered _ is intended to illustrate Heisenberg's declaration that
observable phenomena are not necessarily as they appear.
</P>
<P>
   The works achieve a range of success, and they wander to varying
degrees into the explication of the science. ``Copenhagen'' does
the most with the most; even if you can't reiterate Heisenberg's
theories after you leave the theater, you feel as if you understand
them while you're in it. (For the record, Heisenberg stated that it
is impossible to know both an atomic particle's position and its
momentum exactly; to observe a particle, he argued, you have to hit
it with a photon of light, and such a collision will affect the
particle's course. Full disclosure: I looked it up and also
discussed it with Frayn.)
</P>
<P>
   But in all of these works, the pursuit of scientific knowledge
looms as a search for beauty and truth, which a number of these
plays argue is precisely what playwrights and other artists do. (To
this end, Groff's ``Five Hysterical Girls'' concludes with a play
within the play.) Several _ ``Now Then Again'' and Auburn's
``Proof,'' for example _ equate the difficult search for scientific
truth with the search for human connection and love. And all make
the case that science, like art or love, is a deeply human
endeavor, all but doomed, pardon the expression, to uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This flowering use of science as narrative material and
scientific concepts as metaphors for the stage is worth remarking
on for several reasons. For one thing, it provides evidence that
science is re-entering the realm of popular culture, not just in
imaginative, futuristic fiction but also in other mainstream and
alternative forms: from historical reconstruction and theoretical
abstraction to fluffy romance and contemporary realism.
</P>
<P>
   Why this is so is a matter for speculation. ``One explanation is
that it's completely random,'' Auburn said in an interview, a sly
invocation of a mathematical concept in itself. But the revolution
in technology is surely a factor. The World Wide Web, e-mail, cell
phones (particular favorites of theatergoers, it seems) have all
been around long enough to have saturated public consciousness yet
are still new enough to feel like magic; you don't have to be able
to explain them to use them or be impressed by their prevalence.
And it's clear that scientific discoveries, or at least their
manifestations, have entered public discourse and the acquisitive,
boom-time culture with the force of fashion. The high-minded
mysteries of science suddenly seem, um, hip.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into a societal mood has always been the theater's stock
in trade, and the emergence of science on stage is a sign of this,
just as a stream of plays about gender politics, sexual identity
and AIDS have been over the last two decades, or as plays dealing
with poverty- and squalor-driven violence emerged as the gap
between the affluent and deprived strata of society widened. Not to
say that the theater is undergoing a sea change, but writers do
seem to be taking note of a new country to explore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a technological age we're living in,'' said Auburn,
whose background in mathematics peaked, he said, with a B-minus in
college calculus, ``and technology is a field that produces a lot
of drama. Maybe the divide between the two cultures'' _ that is,
the one that separates scientists from nonscientists _ ``is
breaking down a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   For playwrights this territory is full of challenges, the main
one being the issue of how much to explain about concepts that few
if any audience members are familiar with. In ``Copenhagen,'' Frayn
used the character of Bohr's wife, Margrethe, a highly intelligent
woman but not a world-class physicist, as an intermediary between
her husband and Heisenberg and in some ways as a stand-in for the
audience. To include her in their conversations, they have to
explain things they would silently assume with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn purposely shied away from equation-solving in his play _
the proof of the title has to do with prime numbers, but what it
proves is never made explicit _ but in the opening act one
character believes that another is not mathematically savvy, and as
he condescends to her he's also helping the audience. And Auburn
did have his play vetted by members of the math department at New
York University, who also visited rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the cast got from them,'' Auburn said, ``more than any
specific math information, was a feel for what the discourse is
like. It isn't dry or analytical; they were having fun,
argumentative discussions about their field, really scrapping with
each other. It was surprising to the performers, I think.'' In any
case, he said, the focus of his play is less on math than it is on
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Frayn, on the other hand, went the opposite way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably is too much explication,'' he said. ``But I
wouldn't have done it if it didn't seem essential to the story.
It's difficult to understand why everyone felt they were absolutely
safe, as far as the usage of atomic bombs is concerned, unless you
explain about the two uranium isotopes and fast neutrons. And you
can't make clear why the balance of probability began to change
unless you explain the change of uranium into plutonium in a
reactor. You simply cannot tell the story without explaining those
things. It's not to everyone's taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the science comprehensible, said Frayn, whose academic
background is in philosophy, was, indeed, difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of writing and rewriting, to make it clear to
myself,'' he said. ``I did find that difficult, but if I could make
it clear to myself, I thought other people could follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential perplexities aside, the new science plays add welcome
elements to the theatrical landscape. There's a whole new
vernacular afoot, a scientific argot whose music is just beginning
to be parsed. Terms like lepton, composite number, photon and
isotope haven't exactly been part of the stage's working vocabulary
until now, and watching playwrights work with them and struggle to
make them useful as communicative, sonorous tools can be a nifty
pleasure for theatergoers. And if the grand concepts of science
they connote can be lassoed by playwrights well enough to make them
a little more accessible and applicable to you and me, that's a
service.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I particularly like is the spate of unusual new
characters that science brings to the stage. These include people
like Heisenberg and Bohr (played with great verbal elan by Michael
Cumpsty and Philip Bosco), whose high-minded retrospective debate
(they are brought back from the dead for the purpose) makes
excruciatingly clear the application of intellectual abstraction to
concrete events. But there is also a whole collection of younger
people with young people's immediate concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Proof'' and in ``Now Then Again'' the main characters, all
in their 20s, find the pursuit of difficult knowledge no less
enlivening and nervous-making than things like their careers, their
families, their social graces, their hormones and their heartaches.
I can't recall having seen similar types on the stage before this,
and the two pairs of actors involved _ Mary-Louise Parker and Ben
Shenkman in ``Proof,'' Joseph Wycoff and Katie McLean in ``Now Then
Again'' _ make their characters revelatory. All four performances
were thoroughly rounded and persuasive, illuminating an obviously
extant kind of life experience I'd never before considered but was
delighted to discover. Intelligence and Emotion
</P>
<P>
   Not least among the satisfactions of these plays is that they
add ammunition to the combat against American culture's troubling
anti-intellectualism. Whatever the artistic achievement of these
works, what each of them accomplishes is the lesson that
intelligence is not a quality that exists as an antithesis to _ or
even apart from _ conscience, emotional capability or common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to write about smart people,'' Auburn said. ``You're
not condescending to your own characters when you write about them.
You're looking up to them and trying to do them justice.''
</P>
<P>
   May there be more of them.

&HT;     IRONY OF U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS: OLE FOES CAN BECOME NEW
FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, June 4) &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the president of China phones the president of
the United States to thank him for his efforts in winning House
passage of a trade bill, that is not just news. It is a step toward
improved relations between two of the mightiest powers on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The call, which came on May 28, took White House staffers by
surprise. None of them could remember President Jiang Zemin having
previously initiated a telephone call to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For about 40 minutes, the two presidents reportedly talked about
issues including nuclear non-proliferation, the relationship
between China and Taiwan, possible U.S. construction of a missile
defense system, and, of course, trade.
</P>
<P>
   In tandem with House Republican leaders, Clinton worked
diligently to win House approval of legislation to grant China
normal trade status on a permanent basis rather than on the
year-to-year arrangement that has been in effect for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Clinton was at odds with his Democratic leaders in
the House _ Richard Gephardt of Missouri and David Bonior of
Michigan _ and with one of the party's staunchest political allies,
organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   But the House voted, 237 to 197, for the trade bill. It provided
an excellent example of the claim that politics breeds strange
bedfellows. Leading the pro-vote were two normally bitter foes:
Clinton and House GOP Whip Tom DeLay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   House passage of the measure, followed by the trans-Pacific
phone call, should place relations with China on a more even and
productive course than they often have been in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The next hurdle is to win Senate approval, which is expected to
be achieved more easily than in the House.
</P>
<P>
   One major obstruction to Senate approval could be Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., who heads the Foreign Relations Committee and is
against doing anything to improve Clinton's legacy during the last
months of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, who has persevered in his effort to cultivate
Jiang, is not about to cave in before a Helms onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   The current situation points up the irony that has characterized
the U.S.-Chinese relationship over many years.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, China, like England and the Soviet Union,
was a staunch ally of the United States. Although that war ended in
1945 for America, Britain and the Soviet Union, another one erupted
anew in China where the nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek and the
communists led by Mao Zedong continued to fight a civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Despite aid from America, the nationalists lost and left the
mainland for the island of Taiwan (then known as Formosa) in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, Americans found themselves in bloody warfare
against China, their one-time ally, in the frozen hills of North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Here at home, with McCarthyism in full rampage, Republicans _
including Richard Nixon _ accused leaders of the Truman
administration of being ``soft on communism'' and of ``losing''
China. They also asserted that Truman had dispatched warships to
the Formosa Strait, which separates mainland China from Taiwan, to
prevent the nationalists from launching an invasion of the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was pure poppycock. When Dwight D. Eisenhower
became president in 1953, he withdrew the ships from the Formosa
Strait, and some newspaper headlines proclaimed ``Ike Unleashes
Chiang.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing happened. Of his own volition, Chiang remained
leashed. He could not wage warfare against Mao's forces without
U.S. help, and Ike was not about to commit American military might
to the China battle.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and China remained enemies throughout the
1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Then another irony occurred. Nixon, who had built his early
career on opposition to all things communist, had become president
and in 1972 accepted an invitation to visit China. Thus he opened a
door that had been tightly closed to Americans for nearly a quarter
century.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw when he got there was a stultified society. Grand
buildings constructed long ago by English imperialists were in
decay. Farmers were tilling the soil with ancient instruments. Many
women slaved at home without modern conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   In what was the singular highlight of his presidency, Nixon had
an enjoyable and worthwhile visit in China. But he did not formally
extend diplomatic recognition to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   That task fell to Jimmy Carter, who made the announcement to
coincide with a visit to the United States by Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping. Deng arrived on Dec. 29, 1979, and diplomatic recognition
became effective on January 1, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In his diary, Carter wrote: `I was favorably impressed with
Deng. He's small, tough, intelligent, frank, courageous,
personable, self-assured, friendly, and it's a pleasure to
negotiate with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan, who like Nixon had been a
strong opponent of communist China, visited that country in 1984,
continuing policies that Nixon and Carter had originated.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's vice president, George Bush, had been U.S. envoy to
China during Gerald Ford's presidency and was highly respected by
the Chinese. As vice president and then as president, he returned
to China as a friend.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes. Old foes become new friends. That is the story and
the irony of American-Chinese relations.

AGASSI KNOCKED OUT OF FRENCH OPEN BY KUCERA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ On tour, they call Karol Kucera ``Little Cat,'' and down
the stretch on Thursday at the French Open, Andre Agassi looked as
defenseless as a goldfish in a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For Agassi, there will be no repeat of last year's emotional
journey at Roland Garros. No theatrical bows and blown kisses to
all corners of the court. No hands clutching the head in stunned
delight. No communion with the Parisian public.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi turned escape into an art form here on his way to the
1999 title, but this year it was Kucera's turn to twist free of the
ropes, winning 2-6, 7-5, 6-1, 6-0 in the second round and sending a
shock wave through the refurbished center court where Agassi and
Steffi Graf became champions last year, before they became an item.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a disastrous first week for U.S. tennis stars: The
No. 2 men's seed Pete Sampras and the No. 2 women's seed Lindsay
Davenport were both beaten in the first round. The top-seeded
Agassi, winner of three of the last four Grand Slam events, made it
only one round further, and like Davenport, part of the explanation
was a physical problem. In Davenport's case, it was a wrenched
back; in Agassi's case a blister on his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi served for a two-set lead at 5-4 in the second set, but
at 15-15, he dumped an ill-advised and poorly struck drop shot into
the net. He then got the worst of a cross-court forehand exchange
with Kucera and then, on the next point, missed a backhand passing
shot to lose his serve and his edge. Kucera soon broke his serve
again _ with Agassi making unforced errors on the final two points
_ to even the match at one-set apiece. ``That gave me a lot of
confidence,'' Kucera said. ``He had the whole match in his hands
and suddenly it's one-set all.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kucera jumped out to a 4-1 lead in the third set, Agassi
returned to his chair, pulled off his right shoe and sock and
summoned trainer Per Bastholt. Agassi explained that a blister had
started bothering him late in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   Bastholt wrapped Agassi's big toe and treated the sole of his
foot, where a new blister was developing. But while Agassi returned
to the court, he would not win another game, losing 11 in a row in
total, as Kucera confidently smacked ground strokes to the corners
and Agassi proved incapable of keeping up with his rhythm. Agassi
then proved incapable of bringing himself to answer questions from
the media, fleeing Roland Garros and risking a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a mere slap on the wristband for a tennis player
of Agassi's means, but there is no question that Thursday's loss
will hurt a great deal more despite the fact that it did have a
precedent. Kucera, a fluid 26-year-old counterpuncher from Slovakia
with a great running forehand, had a 2-2 record against Agassi
coming into the match and beat him in a testy fourth-round match at
the U.S. Open in 1997, in which Agassi mocked Kucera's habit of
catching his service toss and began hitting moonballs in
frustration. Kucera and his coach Miloslav Mecir took Agassi's
behavior as a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players just have a good game for certain other players,
and Karol has a good game for playing Andre,'' Mecir said. ``He
doesn't get bothered by power. He can find answers to hard shots,
and he can run very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kucera was ranked eighth in the world at the end of the 1998
season, and he might have finished in the top 10 again last year if
not for a sore right wrist that kept him from playing for six weeks
in the summer. According to Mecir, the former U.S. Open finalist
whose nickname ``The Big Cat'' inspired Kucera's, his pupil decided
to change the type of string in his racquet at the end of last
season in an attempt to alleviate the chronic pain in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought it would be gentler on the arm, but the problem was
that he lost confidence and control of the ball,'' Mecir said.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling early in the season, losing in the first round
of the Australia Open and in the year's first two Masters Series
events in Indian Wells and Key Biscayne, Kucera resumed using his
former strings and made life difficult for the opposition, beating
Gustavo Kuerten on clay in Monte Carlo and winning all four of his
matches easily at the World Team Cup last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had some chances today,'' Kucera said. ``I feel that
my game is coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   With Agassi out, Michael Chang is the only U.S. man to reach the
third round. Anna Kournikova, the No. 14 women's seed, was
eliminated, if not necessarily upset, by Sylvia Plischke of
Austria, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3. No player has ever attracted so much
attention without ever winning a tournament, and Kournikova's
losing streak will not end in Paris, but her inconsistency against
Plischke was certainly due, in part, to the torn ankle ligament she
suffered three weeks ago and which curtailed her preparation for
Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising was Argentine qualifier Agustin Calleri's
four-set victory over Kucera's Slovakian Davis Cup teammate Dominik
Hrbaty, the No. 14 seed and one of the world's most dangerous
clay-court players.
</P>
<P>
   Marat Safin, the 20-year-old Russian survived his grueling
encounter with flashy Australian Andrew Ilie after Ilie retired
because of cramps in his legs and right arm while trailing 0-5 in
the final set. Stefan Koubek of Austria was unable to finish his
match for a different reason. While trailing Attila Savolt of
Hungary by the score of 3-6, 7-5, 6-0, 5-2, he was defaulted after
throwing his racquet in anger at a line call and hitting a ballboy.
Koubek said he never intended to strike the youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry with myself that it went this far, but it happened
and now I can't change anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither can Agassi, and it will be intriguing to see whether
Thursday's defeat is merely a bump in his road or the beginning of
another detour for a man whose career has been defined by peaks and
valleys. As for Kucera, he must be wary of a letdown. And if he has
any doubt about the danger, he should bear in mind what happened to
Dominique Van Roost one day after her tear-filled victory over
Davenport. Facing Spaniard Marta Marrero and leading 6-0, 4-1, she
ran out of energy and accuracy on Thursday and ended up losing in
three sets.

GRIT AND HUMOR MAKE DOLE A HERO TO MANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4) 
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some ways, Bob Dole is an unlikely spokesman for older
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the former Kansas senator was one of 68 Republicans
in the House who voted against the creation of Medicare in 1965,
although he has since supported it. He loathes the idea of retiring
and, at 76, doesn't consider himself old. His most cynical
detractors say he is cashing in on his celebrity status by
accepting money from Pfizer for appearing in ads urging men with
erectile dysfunction to have checkups and, presumably,
prescriptions for Viagra, which Pfizer makes. The ads made him
late-night fodder for Leno and Letterman for months.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all that, and in the wake of his unsuccessful run
for the presidency in 1996, Dole has emerged as a hero to many
older people, regardless of their politics. For them, he has
displayed a rare combination of determination, courage and humor in
the face of severe battlefield wounds suffered in World War II that
left him with a withered right arm. He also has struggled with
serious illnesses, including prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a pretty good role model for seniors,'' he said
during a recent interview in his office at Verner, Liipfert,
Berhnard, McPherson &AMP; Hand, the Washington law firm where he is a
special counselor. ``I've had problems and worked through all of
those. I'm getting older, but I've survived. Maybe by speaking out
I can help people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mike Mcgee, Pfizer's senior medical adviser, who also sat in
on the interview, said: ``Everyone expected Senator Dole to
disappear after he lost the 1996 election. But what does he do? He
goes public, and with humor and a real smart and engaging
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Mcgee was referring to Dole's 1998 appearance on CNN's ``Larry
King Live,'' when he disclosed that he had taken part in clinical
trials for Viagra and that it had halted his impotency resulting
from the removal of his cancerous prostate in 1991. Overnight, a
medical condition that had received little attention exploded into
the public's awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was a little startled,'' Dole said. ``She didn't know
I was going to say it.''
</P>
<P>
   At first he was a bit testy over the Viagra jokes, but has since
mellowed and concedes that, ``Actually, some of them were pretty
funny.'' Doles revelation on television led to his relationship
with Pfizer. In addition to Viagra-related ads, he also helps the
drug giant with a broader campaign to inform older Americans about
the value of early detection and treatment of diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much Viagra,'' Dole said. ``It's the underlying
cause of E.D.''
</P>
<P>
   Early detection usually means drug therapy, which is good for
companies like Pfizer. ``There is a vested interest for Pfizer or
any of the pharmaceutical companies,'' Mcgee said. ``They are very
prejudiced toward prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two years that Pfizer has run its Viagra ads, 7 million
men have received the drug. For every million who asked for Viagra,
it was also discovered that an estimated 30,000 had untreated
diabetes, 140,000 had untreated high blood pressure and 50,000 had
untreated heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dole says the fact he is on Pfizer's payroll has not affected
his opinions on issues, including those related to health care.
``I'm still a free citizen; I've never been told I shouldn't
express some opinion,'' he said. ``I don't have any inhibitions.''
</P>
<P>
   He favors a federal program to help low-income people pay for
drugs, but does not think the government should get involved for
people who can afford them on their own.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the proposal by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to partly
privatize Social Security by allowing people to invest a portion of
their contributions in the stock market is fine in concept. But he
worries that ``the devil is in the details.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to protect the people who aren't good at investing,''
he said. ``Maybe put the money in savings accounts or CDs or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal ``is not a radical plan,'' he said. ``It's bold,
because for the first time you would change Social Security. It
puts it on the table. People can shoot at it. It's going to be a
big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his proudest accomplishment in the Senate came in 1983,
when he and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, helped
lead bipartisan efforts to rescue Social Security. Dole suggested
that he and Moynihan could chair a commission Bush plans to appoint
to work on his Social Security proposal.
</P>
<P>
   He stresses the importance of preventive care and of remaining
engaged. ``I sort of got into a slump in my 50s,'' he said. ``Then
I started to realize how important it is to take care of yourself.
Now I work out on a treadmill. I can't do much with my arms, but I
figured I'd keep my legs strong. I want to be mobile. I've seen
people I thought were old at 50. They don't take care of
themselves. It's so important to stay connected and exercise your
mind and body.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, tan and trim after losing 12 pounds on the Atkins diet,
hates the idea of retiring. ``Suddenly you wake up and you're
70-some years old,'' he said. ``But I've never thought of myself as
old. To me, old is when you can't function. I go down to Florida.
We stay about three days. I like to get a little sun and then I
want to come home. Some people stay three months, six months. What
do they do?''
</P>
<P>
   Dole says his age _ 73 at the time _ cost him some votes when he
ran for the White House. ``But I've demonstrated I would have lived
out my first term, anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said everyone had to make his or her own judgment about when
to retire, but he thinks some people overreact to growing old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if you really get paranoid you don't buy any new
shirts or shoes,'' he said. ``You think, `Well, I'll never wear
these out.' I guess when you get to be Strom's age, you worry about
room service _ `How long will it be? Thirty minutes?''' He was
referring to Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, 97.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Summery heat will envelop most of the East Coast states Friday,
but a cold front moving east from the Ohio Valley will ensure a
return to seasonable temperatures in the Northeast this weekend.
Afternoon readings will peak in the upper 90s over parts of the
Middle Atlantic states and interior Southeast. The heat and high
humidity will set the stage for a broken band of strong
thunderstorms to form in the midday and afternoon as a cold front
sweeps east. In the wake of the front, northwesterly breezes will
deliver much cooler air to the Middle West.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms with heavy rain will occur from northwestern Texas
to western Oklahoma as moisture-laden air is lifted near a wavering
front. Weak high-level winds will foster slow-moving storms which
will raise the risk of local flooding. Meanwhile, most of the
Southwest will be hot and dry.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HURRICANE SEASON
</P>
<P>
   The six-month Atlantic hurricane season began Thursday, but the
most active time in the season is still a few months away. Although
tropical oceans have warmed above the 80 degree temperature
threshold for hurricane development, vigorous winds near 50,000
feet will rip apart most seedling clusters of thunderstorms roaming
the Atlantic. These winds will relax as the summer progresses, with
the heart of hurricane season arriving in the middle of September.
A typical season produces 10 tropical storms, six of which reach
hurricane status with winds of at least 65 knots. &QL;

&HT;     WHOSE RIGHTS RULE IN ADOPTIONS? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court this week declined to block an
Oregon law allowing adult adoptees access to their birth records
without the prior consent of their biological parents.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be the high court's last word on this emotional
issue. But the action freed Oregon to go ahead with an experiment
that a group of biological mothers had tried to legally stop. And
it could eventually eliminate the secrecy that has traditionally
protected the privacy of adoptions throughout this country.
</P>
<P>
   This is a classic case of a clash of individual rights. Whose
are more important?
</P>
<P>
   Adults who have been adopted but have no idea of their ancestry
are understandably curious about their biological roots. And
knowledge about their birth parents can be useful in assessing
hereditary behavioral and disease traits.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oregon law is wickedly unfair to mothers who give up
their babies for adoption. They generally do so for sad and
humiliating but compelling reasons. The babies may be illegitimate,
the result of horrific rape, or simply a financial and emotional
burden that a poor family or teen-age mother cannot assume.
</P>
<P>
   The parents have counted on the presumption _ usually based on a
specific promise from state officials _ that the stigma of an
unwanted pregnancy would not be revived years later by a forced
confrontation with accusatory offspring. Illegitimacy may no longer
be the devastating scandal it used to be, but the decision to make
it public should be the mother's alone.
</P>
<P>
   Some adoptive parents may not object to their adoptee's
fascination with biological roots but some may feel bumped to
second place, with all their years of nurturing reduced to
something unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   Now Oregon is about to plunge into that emotional thicket while
the world watches. The experiment will also challenge the sincerity
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush and other conservatives opposed to
abortion who have been crusading for adoption as an alternative to
ending a pregnancy. If unwed, poor or mentally troubled mothers
carry the fetus to term, what consequences await them later?
</P>
<P>
   Will Bush and company protect their privacy? Who will adopt such
children if they know they may later be forced to deal with
potentially irresponsible birth parents?
</P>
<P>
   Four other states allow adults who have been adopted
unconditional access to their original birth certificates so they
can find their biological parents whether the parents want to meet
them or not. They are Kansas, Tennessee and Alaska; Alabama
approved an unconditional access law last month.
</P>
<P>
   Similar bills are also under consideration in other states,
although across most of the country original birth certificates are
sealed and can be opened only by court order.
</P>
<P>
   Limited access is allowed in 19 states if the birth parents
consent, which seems like a sensible compromise that hurts no one
and can be useful to both parties.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 6 million Americans are adopted, and there is no
way to know how many adult adoptees have been told about the
circumstances which led to their arrival at their new family. It is
an individual parental decision, and a very private one.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago open-records advocacy groups began publicly
pressing for access to adoptees' pasts, claiming the right to know
everything trumped the right to privacy. They have a legal and
political advantage over a group of birth mothers who have been
fighting them; the adoptees speak openly before the media while the
mothers have of necessity remained anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is explosive on many levels. In some cases, there
may be a happy reunion. Web sites and other commercial registries
try to arrange such reunions.
</P>
<P>
   But anecdotal evidence indicates that often opening old records
meant to be closed creates trouble and turmoil. The mother may have
a cherished civic reputation and a new family that does not know of
her youthful indiscretion. There is unlikely to be any emotional or
cultural bond between mother and child after all those years. In
one notorious case, a black man who was the child of a rape knocked
on the door of his middle-aged white birth mother and sent her into
terrified shock.
</P>
<P>
   Many adoptees say they simply wish to have more information and
are not out to embarrass their birth mothers. But with open records
they can do both.
</P>
<P>
   A Portland lawyer, Franklin Hunsaker, who represented six
biological mothers who fought the Oregon law, said that his clients
were ``scared and even angry that their rights have been ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   If enough women are scared about what is happening, more and
more will choose abortion over adoption. The open-records movement
is so young we don't have proof yet that it encourages abortion.
But common sense says it will.

&HT;     BOY ABDUCTED BY MOTHER REUNITED WITH HIS FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DEMIAN BULWA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A 10-year-old California boy has been reunited
with his father after an eight-year ordeal that began when the
man's wife allegedly poisoned him with an insecticide-laced
milkshake and fled to Mexico with their son.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest break in the bizarre case _ which has been featured
more than 20 times on the television program ``Unsolved Mysteries''
_ didn't arrive until March 15 when the wife, San Francisco native
Elizabeth Fuentes-Ortiz, was arrested near Guadalajara. She was
brought back to the United States to face charges.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, FBI agents have been working on locating and
bringing back her son, Jonathan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the police have kept a close eye on Fuentes-Ortiz,
who is at the women's jail in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday night, they said, it paid off when San Mateo County
sheriff's deputies at the jail became suspicious when two adults
and a boy arrived and requested an 8 p.m. jailhouse visit.
</P>
<P>
   After the visit, the trio _ Jonathan, his maternal grandmother
and another relative _ were stopped by the Redwood City police. The
grandmother admitted the boy was Jonathan and said he had been
staying at her home in Alameda County for the past week, said
Redwood City Sgt. Kathryn Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, Gilbert Ortiz, 31, greeted a son who has
become a stranger _ and who may have been told any number of
stories about his father, said Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson declined to say where Ortiz lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is that I talked to Gilbert's sister, and
she said the meeting was very nice, but that there were a lot of
emotions involved,'' said Anderson, who has investigated the case
from the start. ``Pretty cool, huh? Certainly this has hugely
affected many lives. And, at this point, it was so important for
the father to see the son. We're just hoping for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes-Ortiz, who police said was going by the name Rosa Isela
Negrete, was arrested by the FBI on a federal Unlawful Flight to
Avoid Prosecution warrant signed in 1992. She is charged with
attempting to murder her husband and also will face parental
abduction charges, Anderson said. She is being held in lieu of $1
million bond.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The police say the saga began March 11, 1992, when Fuentes-Ortiz
took lunch _ a McDonald's hamburger and a milkshake _ to her
husband while he was working at Toys R Us in Redwood City. She
allegedly told him the shake was filled with amino acids to help
him build muscles and that it might taste funny.
</P>
<P>
   The shake was spiked with a common insecticide and Ortiz went
into convulsions 10 seconds later in the store's break room,
Anderson said. His heart stopped, and his liver failed, and, before
he lapsed into a coma, he was able to tell the police only that a
friend had provided the concoction.
</P>
<P>
   When he emerged from the coma 11 days later, he filled in the
rest of the story, and the police went to his house to serve a
search warrant and arrest Fuentes-Ortiz. But she had left with
Jonathan, without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   The police still do not have a clear motive in the alleged
poisoning, Anderson said, and Fuentes-Ortiz has declined to give a
statement. Ortiz told detectives in 1992 that his marriage was a
happy one.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Ortiz had permanent nerve damage in his feet and
toes and got muscle spasms in his calves that caused him to
stumble. He has little sensitivity in his fingertips and may have
suffered permanent liver and kidney damage.
</P>
<P>
   The police and the FBI tried to track down Jonathan and
Fuentes-Ortiz in the years after the alleged abduction, focusing on
Mexico because of tips from informants and family members, and
chasing down dozens of leads that followed appearances on
``Unsolved Mysteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the FBI's Fugitive Task Force in San Francisco
assigned an agent to the case. After a confirmed sighting of
Fuentes-Ortiz, she was arrested at her home in La Barca, Jalisco
state, with the cooperation of local officials. Anderson then asked
the National Center for Missing and Exploited to make a
computer-enhanced photo of what Jonathan would look like at 10
years old, and gave it to deputies at the Women's Correctional
Center, asking them to call her at home if they received a visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a mother, I took a leap of faith and figured she would
want to see her child,'' Anderson said.

 &HT;    Forsyth Central students heading west in '39 Ford
 &HT;    By Sandy Amann John
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An opportunity of a lifetime'' is surely an overused phrase, but
when Forsyth Central High School sophomore Steven Dockery uses it
to describe his plans for the summer, it's hard to accuse him of
exaggerating.
</P>
<P>
   Dockery, three classmates and their teacher, Bill Hembree, will
put 4,000 miles on a 1939 Ford convertible and see the back roads
of America as they become Georgia's first entry in the high school
division of the History Channel's Great Race in June.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomores Matthew Williams and Nick Martin and freshman Travis
O'Dell will share navigation duties with Dockery.
</P>
<P>
   Hembree's interest in the race was fueled last year when the
event _ really a cross-country road rally for vintage cars _
started on the Marietta Square.
</P>
<P>
   The auto service instructor learned the race has a high school
division, the X Cup, to encourage young people to become interested
in vintage cars. He turned to his friends in the Early Ford V-8
Club for help, and member Mike Coggins donated the '39 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Coggins, a local car collector who owns three of the rare '39
ragtops, shared Hembree's enthusiasm about the Great Race and
decided to lend the car in an effort to ``get kids involved in
older cars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In return for his generosity, Coggins will share driving duties
with Hembree during the race. Fixing up the convertible and raising
the money needed to cover costs during the rally has been a class
and school project since December.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford _ painted ``coach maroon'' with leather upholstery,
wood-grain dash and a rumble seat _ was in good shape cosmetically,
but it needed a lot of mechanical work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rebuilt it mechanically so it won't break down,'' Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   The students pulled the engine and took it apart; it was rebuilt
by a member of the Early Ford V-8 Club. Students redid the
60-year-old wiring from bumper to bumper and worked on the
transmission and brakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also had to modify the cooling system so it will run
cooler,'' said O'Dell, pointing out the car will be driven over the
Rockies and through the desert during the 15-day race.
</P>
<P>
   They also fixed up the interior, adding insulation and modern
equipment such as seat belts and turn signals, as required by the
race and state laws along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The owner paid for the parts, Hembree said, and Forsyth Central
students supplied the labor of restoring the convertible. Many
students came to the school's auto shop on holidays or stayed late
to work on the project.
</P>
<P>
   The car is powered by a V-8 ``flathead'' engine, which
originally put out about 85 horsepower, but it ``has been
extensively modified'' to about 125 hp, he said. It's also been
modified to use unleaded fuel; it requires premium unleaded and
gets about 20 mpg.
</P>
<P>
   Along with fixing up the car, Forsyth Central students have had
to raise money to pay for the race. While the History Channel
waives the customary $10,000 entry fee for X Cup contestants, there
are plenty of other costs. Motel rooms, meals and spare parts add
up; Hembree estimates the total at $12,000 to $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   The school raised a few thousand dollars at a car show in
Cumming in May, and students approached friends, family and local
businesses to raise more.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Race moves from town to town on back roads, avoiding
interstates except to enter and leave major cities. The vintage
cars never go more than 55 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be fording creeks, driving on unimproved roads,''
Hembree said. ``We'll drive through everything: rain, snow. We've
got a convertible, but no air conditioning. It's got a heater, but
we don't know how well it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Other systems can fail easily, too, so the team will travel with
enough spare parts to fix most emergencies. They'll take an extra
generator, distributor, water and fuel pumps, and parts for the
engine and carburetor, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Spare tires are another consideration. Race rules require cars
to use tires from their original era _ no radials. Last year, one
race entry suffered 12 flats.
</P>
<P>
   And the convertible needs an oil change every 1,000 miles
because there's no oil filter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to practice repairing by the side of the road,''
Martin added. A ``sweep truck'' follows entrants on each leg of the
race and can haul a broken-down car to the next stop, so
participants won't be stranded, but the team is responsible for
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the Early Ford V-8 Club will travel along as a
support team. If necessary, they and the three students who don't
have navigation duty the next morning will work through the night
to make repairs and get the convertible on the road again.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty at stake for doing well in the race. The X Cup
offers $25,000 in scholarship money, which will be divided among
the eight youth teams based on their showing in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Race is a point-to-point rally with teams relying on
an analog speedometer and clock as their only navigation tools.
Hembree's students have met with race veterans and watched an
instructional video on navigation techniques, which they then put
to practice in weekend on-the-road sessions.
</P>
<P>
   To start the race, the students will fly to Boston after
finishing final exams. The Ford will be carted there in a covered
trailer supplied by the Early Ford V-8 Club. During the race, the
car will be garaged in the trailer each night to protect it ``from
the weather and sabotage,'' Dockery said.
</P>
<P>
   While the driver and navigator complete the three or four legs
of the race each day, the other team members will head to the next
town in a Chevrolet Suburban. The teenagers are expected to help
Great Race workers with jobs such as setting up banners and parking
cars as the vintage vehicles take part in festivities in each host
town.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 100 pre-1951 vehicles are competing, the largest
field in the 18-year history of the race, according to Debra Fazio,
a spokeswoman for the History Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The X Cup division is in its fourth year. After crossing the
finish line in Sacramento, Calif., Hembree and his students will
rent a car and head home, stopping at the Grand Canyon, the Alamo,
New Orleans and whatever else interests them.
</P>
<P>
   Between taking the northern route out west and the southern
route back to Georgia, they expect to drive through 23 states.
</P>
<P>
   The '39 Ford will be pulled home in the trailer; the car and
team are scheduled to ride in Cumming's Fourth of July parade.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Forsyth Central students were interested in joining
the X Cup team. Hembree settled on four based on criteria including
``discipline, grade-point average and lack of a serious dating
relationship, since we'll be gone for a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who make the trip will get an educational experience that
crosses many disciplines, Hembree said, from math skills required
to navigate to history lessons from seeing the country.
</P>
<P>
   They'll improve their social skills as they meet people from all
around the country, and they'll practice writing, because he's
requiring each student to keep a journal.
</P>
<P>
   And being in a race where thousands of people line the streets
to cheer you on is great for building self-esteem, he added.
``Everybody ought to be cheered by thousands at least once in their
life.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hembree is so sold on the X Cup, he plans to enter
another team from Forsyth Central in 2001, when the race takes off
from Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta. The final destination has
not been determined, Fazio said.
</P>
<P>
   And next year's students will start from scratch with a
different vintage car, because the team earns points for restoring
a vehicle as well as racing it.
</P>
<P>
   Coggins said he'll probably supply a car again next year.
</P>
<P>
   All four of the students on the team say they've ``grown up
around cars,'' and three of them own vehicles that are older than
they are.
</P>
<P>
   Dockery is restoring a 1966 Chevy Caprice, and O'Dell is working
on a '67 Chevy pickup. Williams drives his red 1970 Ford pickup to
school and is building a motor for a '62 Ford. Martin currently has
a mid-'90s-model vehicle, but he plans to get an old one when he
can afford it.

 &HT;    MISSOURI BOY FINALLY REACHES THE TOP AT NATIONAL SPELLING BEE
 &HT;    With SPELLING-PRONOUNCE.
 &HT;    By MIRIAM A. GARCIA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The third try spelled success for George Thampy,
who won the 73rd Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old from Maryland Heights, Mo., took the $10,000
grand prize in the 15th round by spelling demarche, which means
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   After tying for fourth place in the 1998 and tying for third
last year, George returned to the finals this year intent on making
it his last year in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to win,'' said the seventh grader, who like the
second-and third-place winners, is schooled at home. ``Instead of
going back (home) like last year and studying all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the tongue-twisting challenges that he spelled on the way
to victory were propaedeutic, ditokous, eudaemonic and quodlibet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids are betting George is going to win,'' finalist
Brianna Satinoff of Clearwater, Fla., said during the lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   But spelling is just one of his many talents, according to his
mother and home-school teacher, Bina Thampy. George placed second
at the National Geography Bee last week, where he competed against
54 other students.
</P>
<P>
   ``To prepare for this sort of thing, you need to have a certain
amount of inner strength,'' Mrs. Thampy said.
</P>
<P>
   George, who was sponsored by the St. Louis Post Dispatch, must
retire from both the national competitions after reaching the final
rounds. He will dedicate time to his regular subjects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just behind George were Sean Conley of Newark, Calif., who
finished second, and Alison Miller of Niskayuna, N.Y., who finished
third.
</P>
<P>
   Of the original 248 spellers who earned a trip to Washington by
winning regional bees, 110 made it through the first three rounds
of the national bee Wednesday, when some of the words were taken
from a study guide provided in advance.
</P>
<P>
   But their ranks dwindled rapidly in a barrage of obscure and
sometimes nearly unpronounceable words taken from the 460,000-word
Webster's Third New International Dictionary.

 &HT;    AFC Enterprises makes organizational changes
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AFC Enterprises said Thursday it has merged its international
operations and sales development teams into the domestic operating
companies for its top brands.
</P>
<P>
   International and domestic operations had been separate for
AFC's Church's Chicken, Popeyes Chicken &AMP; Biscuits and Cinnabon
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   As the company expands globally, it makes sense to ``have the
president of the operating company strategically lead the worldwide
operations of their companies,'' said AFC President and Chief
Operating Officer Dick Holbrook. ``The international teams are very
excited about being part of the overall brand team. We think this
will help us accelerate growth and provide better support for our
partners internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   AFC has aggressively mined international markets since 1992. The
company has 605 units overseas and expects to open another 200 by
the end of the year. Top markets include Asia, Central America and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook said the company is still considering going public but
declined to specify a date.
</P>
<P>
   He did not rule out an IPO this year. ``I think the market will
dictate that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Systemwide sales at AFC's 3,400 restaurants, bakeries and cafes
and its wholesale and manufacturing operations increased 10.9
percent in the first quarter to $696.5 million. In addition to the
top three brands, AFC owns Seattle's Best Coffee, Torrefazione
Italia Coffee and Ultrafryer Systems.

   CLINTON-EUROPE (Lisbon, Portugal) _ President Clinton called on
Israelis and Palestinians on Thursday to conclude a historic peace
that he said is ``within view now.'' And to help narrow their final
differences, he announced that he will send Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to the Middle East next week to work with both
sides. In remarks after a 90-minute meeting with Prime Minister
Ehud Barak in this seaside capital, Clinton also announced that he
would meet soon with the Palestinians' leader, Yasser Arafat, in
Washington. By Elaine Sciolino.

   RUSSIA-ECON (Vologda, Russia) _ This is Russia's not-quite-open
secret: the crash of 1998, the great financial meltdown that wiped
out Russia's middle class and turned the Kremlin into a global
deadbeat, is over. Its devastating after effects _ a sharply
devalued ruble; the disappearance of imported goods; a government
cut off from addictive foreign loans _ turned out to be fresh fuel
for a domestic economy that had simply run out of gas. The question
is whether that comeback is real and gaining strength, or just so
much whole cloth. The Kremlin casts it as real, if still shaky, and
its numbers look promising. By Michael Wines.

   EBAY-BIDS (Undated) _ When eBay, the Internet auction company,
suspended the seller and voided the sale of a vivid abstract
painting whose price shot from $.25 to $135,805 last month, his
offense had nothing to do with the authenticy of the painting or
the story he invented to go with it. Rather, Kenneth A. Walton had
entered a bid of $4,500 on his own offering _ a practice known as
shill bidding that violates eBay's rules _ on the second day of a
10-day auction, long before speculation that the painting might be
by the renowned painter Richard Diebenkorn sent the price soaring.
But a close analysis of that and other eBay art auctions reveals
that the flourishing cyberauction world faces a deeper, more
intransigent problem: rings of shill-bidders that may, or may not,
include self-bidding. By Judith H. Dobrzynski.

   SCI-STROKE-RECOVER (Undated) _ Using a new kind of stroke
rehabilitation therapy, scientists have shown for the first time
that the brain can be coaxed into reorganizing its circuitry so
that people regain nearly full use of their partially paralyzed
limbs in just two to three weeks, even if the stroke happened years
ago. The rehabilitation, called constraint induced movement
therapy, involves immobilizing a good arm or leg so that the
patient is forced to use his bad arm or leg for familiar tasks.
With intensive practice in using the paralyzed limb, people can
literally rewire parts of their brains, researchers said, and
overcome a kind of learned helplessness that prevented their limbs
from moving. Moreover, the technique works for patients who had
their strokes decades ago and have had limited use of their limbs
ever since. By Sandra Blakeslee.

&HT;     LOCAL TEEN WIN THIRD PLACE IN NATIONAL SPELLING BEE  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alison Miller, 14, of Niskayuna, N.Y., took third
place in the National Spelling Bee Thursday. Alison, who was
sponsored by the Albany Times-Union, became a crowd favorite with
her spritely and confident spellings.
</P>
<P>
   She received a standing ovation when she bowed out of the
competition in the 12th round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm just pretty good at (looking) confident,'' Alison
said after the bee. ``I wasn't exactly confident'' inside, she
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The winner was George Abraham Thampy, 12, a home-school student
from Maryland Heights, Mo., who was competing in his third straight
National Spelling Bee. He correctly spelled ``propaedeutic'' and
``demarche'' for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   George received $10,000 in cash from E.W. Scripps Co., sponsor
of the bee, now in its 73rd year. A week ago, George placed second
in the National Geography Bee in Washington, sponsored by the
National Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   Second place in the Spelling Bee went to Sean Conley, 13, a
home-schooler from San Francisco, who finished ninth in last year's
bee.
</P>
<P>
   Alison is also a home-schooled student.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother and teacher, Mary O'Keefe, said she thought
home-schooled students have an advantage in bees because they have
more time to read and tend to watch less television.
</P>
<P>
   Alison said she watches no more than two hours of television a
month. Her extra study time may have helped her to finish 12th in
the nation in May in the national Mathcounts competition and to
finish among the top 30 in the USA Math Olympiad for high school
students.
</P>
<P>
   Alison's father, Ross Miller, called her ``a remarkable kid.''
</P>
<P>
   She and 109 other spellers had advanced past the first three
rounds on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The rules allow spellers to ask the pronouncer for the language
of origin, the word's definitions, alternate pronunciations and its
use in a sentence in order to help them decipher the word.
</P>
<P>
   Alison _ in a rare display of initiative among spellers _ often
engaged the pronouncer in a dialog, suggesting definitions and word
origins and winning his assent to her versions, before going on to
spell the words correctly.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Alison easily disposed of her first word of the
day, ``quomodo,'' in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   She later said she'd seen quomodo in a book of old words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very excited'' to know the word, she said. ``I'd been
pretty nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   She told the pronouncer she thought quomodo came from a Latin
root, and he said she was correct. Her spelling was flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Alison also knew that her next word, ``parapraxia,'' came from
Greek. Asked to spell ``escritoire'' in the ninth round, she asked
the pronouncer, ``Does that mean a writing desk?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   She then spelled it correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Alison correctly suggested that her 10th round word,
``rouleau,'' was French in origin and that her 12th word,
``venire,'' came from Latin.
</P>
<P>
   But she then misspelled the word as ``veniery'' despite
identifying the root word, and was eliminated from the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I may have seen it before,'' Alison said of venire,
which means a group of people from whom a jury is selected. ``The
pronunciation really didn't register with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Alison moved ahead by correctly spelling ``dengue,''
``mulct,'' ``cloze'' and ``sphingine.''
</P>
<P>
   After asking for the definition of sphingine and being told that
it was defined as resembling a sphinx, Alison let out a knowing
``ahhh'' that led to laughter in the crowd. She quickly spelled the
word and marched happily back to her seat.
</P>
<P>
   She earned $3,000 for winning third place.
</P>
<P>
   Alison, who made it to the third round of the bee in 1998, was
competing in the bee for the last time. Next year she will be
equivalent to a ninth grade student, and will be ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   Alison said she would no longer spend half an hour a night
studying words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to continue studying spelling,'' she said. ``But
I'm going to continue loving words.''
</P>
<P>
   Alison said she plans to be a writer.

UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA COACH GIVEN $6 MILLION CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBBIE ANDREU   
 Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DESTIN, Fla. _ The University of Florida reaffirmed its
commitment to basketball and Billy Donovan this week, giving
Donovan a new five-year, $6 million contract that will make him one
of the highest-paid coaches in college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to build something special with basketball here,
something that will last forever, and obviously we think Billy is
the key to that happening,'' said Jeremy Foley, the University of
Florida athletic director who began negotiating a new deal with
Donovan shortly after the Gators' appearance in the NCAA final in
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important everyone understands this guy is going
to be our basketball coach for a very long time. I think it's
important from a recruiting perspective and a commitment
perspective,'' Foley said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In only four seasons, Donovan has elevated the Florida program
to an elite level. He led the Gators to the Sweet 16 in 1999, and
this year the team played in the national title game for the first
time in school history.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract will pay Donovan an average of $1.2 million
annually over the next five years, tying him with Kentucky's Tubby
Smith as the highest-paid basketball coach in the Southeastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan becomes the school's second millionaire coach, joining
football coach Steve Spurrier, whose annual salary is close to $2
million, making him one of the highest-paid coaches in all of
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most valuable asset in your athletic program are your
coaches,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm thrilled,'' Donovan, 35, said. ``I'm very
fortunate and blessed to be working for an administration and
athletic director like I am here.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time in three years Donovan's contract has
been restructured. His salary this past season was about $750,000,
up $300,000 from his salary two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan's assistants also have been given raises.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said several prominent schools have approached him in
the past couple of years about job opportunities. He said no NBA
teams have contacted him, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm committed to the University of Florida,'' he said. ``I'm
driven by the challenge to get back to the national championship
game and driven to try and maintain the program, keep it going the
way it's going right now.''

<P>
   ``Big Momma's House'' has most of what you'd expect from a
summer movie. In fact, you have or soon will see most of what it's
got in other summer movies.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lawrence stars as a government agent who is a master of
disguise and therefore always yanking amazingly deceptive (to
everyone but the audience) masks off his head just like Tom Cruise
in ``Mission: Impossible.'' He winds up in drag and fat suits, as
Eddie Murphy soon will in the ``Nutty Professor'' sequel.
</P>
<P>
   There's some ultra-gross bathroom humor, a la every other youth
comedy in our boldly advancing new century. Perhaps even more
sickening, Hollywood's latest, sheeplike trend in repulsive
laugh-getting, sloppy tongue kissing, is well-represented here.
</P>
<P>
   All sounds soullessly surefire, doesn't it? Well, it is and it
isn't, but Lawrence's exuberant lead performance and occasional
contributions from a game supporting cast do make for some hearty
howls here and there _ a few of which even rise above the generic
pandering.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, who it can be happily reported appears none the worse
for wear after his near-fatal heat stroke last summer, is FBI
specialist Malcolm Turner. With his schleppy partner John
(``Private Parts'' victim Paul Giamatti), Malcolm is assigned to
the case of a vicious escaped bank robber, Terrence Howard's
Lester. Convinced that the killer crook's never-recovered haul is
in the possession of his former girlfriend Sherry (Nia Long),
Malcolm and John stake out the title Georgia home, owned by the
fleeing young woman's cranky, jumbo-size grandmother (stage actress
Ella Mitchell, an extremely good sport by any reckoning).
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the feds intercept a phone call indicating that
Sherry and her young son, Trent (Jascha Washington), will soon be
arriving at BMH. Problem is, Big Momma has already taken off for an
indefinite period to help a friend in need. So Malcolm breaks out
the fat suit, hoping to trick the long-estranged granddaughter into
giving up the loot and, hopefully, Lester. Of course, Malcolm
doesn't figure that Sherry might be an innocent dupe _ or that
he'll fall hard for her.
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine some of the jokes: masks peeling at inopportune
moments, gargantuan simulations of feminine anatomy with travel
agendas all their own, smitten Malcolm trying to control himself
under all that latex while Sherry blithely makes herself intimately
at home.
</P>
<P>
   But in the film's wilder moments, when Malcolm is expected to
behave like Big Momma without a clue as to what the situation calls
for, Lawrence's vibrant comedic energy blows the roof off the
house. Guess what? Big Momma's a midwife, and the time comes, as it
inevitably will, to deliver. He/she's picked upon to give the
Sunday service witness, and you just know Malcolm hasn't been
inside a church since childhood. He does know, however, exactly
what to do with a bullying self-defense instructor who revels in
brutalizing his elderly students.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Raja Gosnell, a former film editor who last
helmed the astonishingly synthetic Drew Barrymore comedy ``Never
Been Kissed.'' ``Big Momma's'' is certainly more contrived than
that one, and its by-the-book heartwarming moments _ Lawrence, in
more than one false persona, naturally bonds like crazy with the
fatherless Trent _ are just as hokey.
</P>
<P>
   But despite that and its incessant raiding of the summer comedy
gag shelf, this undeniably is also a ``House'' of some genuine,
enjoyable mirth. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When I lay hands on an SUV, one of the first things I like to do
is take it where most SUVs never go _ off road.
</P>
<P>
   In my neck of the New Hampshire woods, that means out where the
skidders have been, following the rutted, muddy, stony, log-strewn
paths of departed or ongoing logging operations. It's a good test
for these rigs because skidders do not pause for steep or sloshy,
stone or stump.
</P>
<P>
   So where better to start my week in the 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee
Limited 4WD? It would be a good test to see if Daimler-Chrysler, in
its 1999 makeover of the Grand Cherokee, had pulled off the
Jekyll-and-Hyde feat of turning this Jeep into a luxurious and
smooth highway performer while at the same time saving its solid
off-road soul.
</P>
<P>
   I took it up steep grades where you could see only the sky
through the windshield. Plunged it through mud, walked it gingerly
over rocks and stumps one wheel at a time, pushed through a
streambed, across a thick scattering of old bark and wood chips,
coaxed it down the same steep grade it had just climbed, this time
with the front bumper seemingly ready to burrow in at any minute.
</P>
<P>
   It remains an off-road beast _ better even than its earlier
incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that has to do with its new engine, the optional
4.7-liter, 235-horsepower plant that replaces the 5.2 and 5.9
liters of old. This new powerplant has 15 more horsepower than the
old 5.2, only 10 less than the 5.9, and gets better gas mileage
than either (17 miles per gallon in off-road and highway driving).
It's a solid case of overhead cams and new technology knocking
aside the old push-rod engine.
</P>
<P>
   It has power that makes it a stubborn crawler up steep hills,
holds the nearly 2-ton rig back on steep declines, and turns it
into a guttural and strong performer on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   But what is best about this new Jeep is its new all-wheel-drive
system. Called Quadra-Trac, it is a full-time, all-wheel-drive
setup that uses sensors to shift torque front to rear, side to
side, and even to single wheels. This means that, if three wheels
are slipping and only one has the faintest hope of purchase, that
wheel gets the torque to nudge you forward. It's great off-road and
will be wonderful for commuting in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Cherokee stands apart in appearance from its more
staid stablemate, the Cherokee, because of a subtle design shift.
They still share the same mouthful-of-Chiclets grille, but on the
Grand Cherokee, that grille is angled back from bumper to hood. The
hood rises in a wedge to a more sloping windshield and a higher
roof line drops off at the rear in a rounded dip. The Cherokee
remains the angular, oblong box it has long been.
</P>
<P>
   The softer lines of the Grand Cherokee hint at the luxury inside
_ an air of comfort meant to please those who won't be chasing
skidders through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The front leather bucket seats have good support up the sides,
though they could use a bit more firmness at the thigh. The rear
bench, billed as a three-person seat, is comfortable at the doors,
but a strange notch has been cut from the cushion at the center,
leaving a middle passenger with less space on which to sit. Leg
room in the rear is a bit tight, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, all is relatively simple with window, door, and
mirror controls on the driver's side armrest, cruise control on the
steering wheel, light controls on one steering column stem, and
wipers on another. Audio and climate controls are big and easy to
use.
</P>
<P>
   Though many SUVs are built on truck platforms, Jeep has put the
new Grand Cherokee with integrated body and frame rails, making it
stiffer and more stable. As with almost any tall vehicle, you get
some sensation of side-to-side roll when cornering at higher
speeds, though the Grand Cherokee is another example of
manufacturers changing suspension and construction methods to make
them more stable than the tippy boxes of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   This model came with an ``Upcountry'' suspension system that
included high-pressure gas shocks, special front and rear springs,
and stabilizer bar. Off-road skid plates and shields were included
in this package.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed transmission did a too-quick, jerky upshift in
lower gears than I would like, but once rolling was smooth in
shifting through higher gears. Disc brakes, assisted by ABS, at all
four wheels brought it to swift, sure stops.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The auxiliary audio control buttons tucked on the backside of
the steering wheel. Felt as if I was playing a video game as I
fooled with volume and stations.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The placing of the driver's seat memory buttons on the door
panel above the armrest. My elbow kept hitting them and changing my
seat position.

 &HT;    CLINTON WARNED BY GERMAN LEADER ON BUILDING MISSILE DEFENSE
SYSTEM
 &HT;    (800&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ President Clinton got a blunt reminder here Thursday of
European unease over a proposed U.S. missile defense system, when
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder warned publicly that such
weaponry might prompt Russia to boost its nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be very careful that any such project does not
re-trigger the process of a renewed arms race,'' Schroeder told
reporters through a translator, with Clinton standing at his side.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder made his remarks following a meeting with Clinton that
focused largely on Russia and the proposed national missile defense
(NMD) system, which, if deployed, would be designed to protect the
United States from an incoming ballistic missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have cast the system as protection against
attack by a rogue state, such as North Korea, or even a
sophisticated terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Moscow have expressed concern, however, that such a
system could upset the balance of strategic power between the
United States and Russia, which together possess more than 80
percent of the world's nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears have been echoed this week in France and elsewhere
across Europe, which suffered two major wars in the last century
and sat on the fault line of a half-century of Cold War tension.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said he expressed his ``concerns'' about that directly
to Clinton, who arrived here late Thursday on the second leg of a
week-long swing through Europe, Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton travels Friday to the German town of Aachen, a
crossroads of European culture for 12 centuries. There, Clinton
will become the first American president to receive the prestigious
Charlemagne Award, a tribute to his efforts to end fighting in the
Balkans, scene of Europe's bloodiest conflict since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is weighing whether to build a limited NMD system that,
proponents claim, would be able to intercept and destroy one or a
few ballistic missiles fired at the United States from across the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon plans to test the system in July then advise
Clinton on its projected cost and effectiveness. It would take four
or five years to put into place.
</P>
<P>
   A decision from Clinton isn't expected until the fall. The issue
is front-and-center on the agenda for talks in Moscow this weekend,
however, between Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who
opposes the system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not respond to Schroeder's remarks in public. During
his meeting, however, Clinton sought to assure the German leader
that the ballistic shield under consideration in Washington would
pose no strategic threat to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a system that is not directed against Russia,''
Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, told reporters
here. ``This is a system that is directed at Saddam Hussein or
North Korea or others who may acquire, or who are acquiring,
long-range missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, said Berger, the administration wants to integrate any
NMD into the existing global arms control regime, specifically
through amendments to the Anti Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty inked
between Russia and the United States in 1972. That treaty restricts
missile shields such as the one that Clinton is considering, on the
grounds that such defenses have the potential to fuel arms
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our very strong preference to proceed, if the president
so decides, in the context of the arms control regime,'' said
Berger, adding that Clinton had stressed that point during his
90-minute meeting with Schroeder. ``We are proceeding with care,
and with deliberation to all the dimensions of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton would stress similar points to Putin when
the president visits Moscow Saturday night (Moscow time) through
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that President Putin hear from President
Clinton how we see the threat, how we see this system, how we don't
see it as a threat against Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Clinton wrapped up a three-day visit to Lisbon
by meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emerged from the meeting saying that Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat must ``do things that they have
not done in the past,'' if they are to meet a Sept. 13 target for
completing negotiations aimed at ending 50 years of war and enmity
between Arabs and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   With time slipping away on his hopes for brokering a
comprehensive Middle East peace accord, Clinton stressed that both
Barak and Arafat must seize ``the real urgency of this moment to
actually get back on the timetable and complete the work that has
to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to lay the groundwork for a Camp David-style peace
summit, Clinton ordered Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
travel to the region and meet separately with both leaders next
week.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Clinton, he would meet in Washington with Arafat ``as
quickly as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tough going, Clinton said he remained hopeful that
Israelis and Palestinians could meet the Sept. 13 target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still convinced that they have the courage and the vision
and the ability to do this,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated his earlier belief that momentum for peace is
building, aided, if also complicated, by Israel's surprise
withdrawal last week from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite accusations from both sides Thursday of foot-dragging in
negotiations, Clinton hopes to pull Arafat and Barak together for a
face-to-face summit well before that to nail down a so-called
framework agreement, or road map toward an overarching peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Compromise is needed from both leaders, though, even to set the
stage for a summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both leaders know, from me and they know from their own
experience, that they now have to be prepared to make an intense
effort,'' Clinton said, ``and to do things that they have not done
in the past, with real courage and vision, if we're going to
actually get a framework agreement that deals with the outstanding
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   After decades of conflict and years of off and on peace talks,
Israel and its Palestinian foes are down to the most difficult
issues dividing them, including the question of Palestinian
statehood, the future of Jerusalem _ claimed by both sides _ and
the right of Palestinian refugees to return to Israeli-controlled
lands.

   Schroeder said he expressed his ``concerns'' about that directly
to Clinton, who arrived here late Thursday on the second leg of a
week-long swing through Europe, Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton travels Friday to the German town of Aachen, a
crossroads of European culture for 12 centuries. There, Clinton
will become the first American president to receive the prestigious
Charlemagne Award, a tribute to his efforts to end fighting in the
Balkans, scene of Europe's bloodiest conflict since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is weighing whether to build a limited NMD system that,
proponents claim, would be able to intercept and destroy one or a
few ballistic missiles fired at the United States from across the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon plans to test the system in July then advise
Clinton on its projected cost and effectiveness. It would take four
or five years to put into place.
</P>
<P>
   A decision from Clinton isn't expected until the fall. The issue
is front-and-center on the agenda for talks in Moscow this weekend,
however, between Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who
opposes the system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not respond to Schroeder's remarks in public. During
his meeting, however, Clinton sought to assure the German leader
that the ballistic shield under consideration in Washington would
pose no strategic threat to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a system that is not directed against Russia,''
Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, told reporters
here. ``This is a system that is directed at Saddam Hussein or
North Korea or others who may acquire, or who are acquiring,
long-range missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, said Berger, the administration wants to integrate any
NMD into the existing global arms control regime, specifically
through amendments to the Anti Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty inked
between Russia and the United States in 1972. That treaty restricts
missile shields such as the one that Clinton is considering, on the
grounds that such defenses have the potential to fuel arms
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our very strong preference to proceed, if the president
so decides, in the context of the arms control regime,'' said
Berger, adding that Clinton had stressed that point during his
90-minute meeting with Schroeder. ``We are proceeding with care,
and with deliberation to all the dimensions of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton would stress similar points to Putin when
the president visits Moscow Saturday night (Moscow time) through
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that President Putin hear from President
Clinton how we see the threat, how we see this system, how we don't
see it as a threat against Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Clinton wrapped up a three-day visit to Lisbon
by meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emerged from the meeting saying that Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat must ``do things that they have
not done in the past,'' if they are to meet a Sept. 13 target for
completing negotiations aimed at ending 50 years of war and enmity
between Arabs and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   With time slipping away on his hopes for brokering a
comprehensive Middle East peace accord, Clinton stressed that both
Barak and Arafat must seize ``the real urgency of this moment to
actually get back on the timetable and complete the work that has
to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to lay the groundwork for a Camp David-style peace
summit, Clinton ordered Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
travel to the region and meet separately with both leaders next
week.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Clinton, he would meet in Washington with Arafat ``as
quickly as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tough going, Clinton said he remained hopeful that
Israelis and Palestinians could meet the Sept. 13 target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still convinced that they have the courage and the vision
and the ability to do this,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated his earlier belief that momentum for peace is
building, aided, if also complicated, by Israel's surprise
withdrawal last week from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite accusations from both sides Thursday of foot-dragging in
negotiations, Clinton hopes to pull Arafat and Barak together for a
face-to-face summit well before that to nail down a so-called
framework agreement, or road map toward an overarching peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Compromise is needed from both leaders, though, even to set the
stage for a summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both leaders know, from me and they know from their own
experience, that they now have to be prepared to make an intense
effort,'' Clinton said, ``and to do things that they have not done
in the past, with real courage and vision, if we're going to
actually get a framework agreement that deals with the outstanding
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   After decades of conflict and years of off and on peace talks,
Israel and its Palestinian foes are down to the most difficult
issues dividing them, including the question of Palestinian
statehood, the future of Jerusalem _ claimed by both sides _ and
the right of Palestinian refugees to return to Israeli-controlled
lands.

   JERUSALEM _ In its hasty withdrawal from Lebanon last week,
Israel may have left behind a major casualty _ its deterrent image.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if a grinning gunslinger in a Clint Eastwood film
confronts the hero and spits in his face. Without so much as a
``make my day,'' Eastwood draws _ his handkerchief and dabs his
cheek. He then walks away, wordlessly acknowledging that he had
trespassed on the gunslinger's turf.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an ending Eastwood fans would find satisfactory, and
Israelis don't like it either. But they are willing to live with it
as long as quiet prevails along their northern border.
</P>
<P>
   The critical question is whether Israel's enemies will regard
its withdrawal from occupied land as a step towards regional peace
or an indication that Israel is no longer invincible.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledgement of Israel's military power is at the base of the
Middle East peace process. Although continuing to regard the Jewish
state as a foreign element and a usurper of Arab land, the Arab
world decided after several wars that Israel could not be defeated
and that they would have to come to terms with it.
</P>
<P>
   Second thoughts induced by Hezbollah's success could lead to
dangerous confrontations. In the past week, large sections of the
Arab media have begun to portray Israel as a paper tiger, and
Hezbollah has pointedly called on the Palestinians to follow in its
path.
</P>
<P>
   It is a reasonable assumption that Palestinian militants _ and
others in the Arab world _ are right now absorbing the implications
of what they perceive as the routing of Israel's vaunted army by a
determined force of guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   A leading Jordanian journalist told an Israeli colleague several
years ago that what had finally convinced him that the Arabs would
have to recognize the Jewish state was Israel's siege of Beirut in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, Israel pounded the city with aircraft and
artillery in an effort to pry the PLO from there. Sometimes an
entire apartment building would be leveled with a ``smart'' bomb in
an effort to get at Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The remorselessness of the Israeli attack in the face of world
condemnation had convinced him, said the journalist, that Israel
would do whatever it thought it had to do in order to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Given that determination and Israel's proven military prowess,
the journalist concluded that the best option available to the
Arabs was to make a reasonable peace.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was war weariness, not determination, that Israel
has projected in recent years over Lebanon. A peace movement, led
by mothers of army-age sons, gave increasing currency to the idea
of pulling out.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak made it a central part of his election
platform last year. Israel was no longer willing to accept an
average of 25 deaths a year to sustain its defense buffer in South
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In the euphoria induced by Hezbollah's impressive performance,
however, there has been a distortion of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Israel's will to fight in Lebanon was due not just
to the casualties it suffered but to a belief by most Israelis that
they were indeed an occupying power and had no business remaining
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The entire fighting arm of Hezbollah is believed by Israeli
experts to number only around 500. In the 1973 Yom Kippur War,
Israel was caught flat-footed by a surprise attack launched by
Egypt and Syria, whose armies numbered in the hundreds of
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning battlefield recovery, Israel defeated both armies
as well as other Arab forces that joined them and showed itself
willing to take the casualties necessary for victory.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,500 fatalities it suffered in less than three weeks were
proportionally several times higher than the price paid by the
United States in Vietnam in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   If threatened on its home ground, Israel will do what it has to
do to survive. Along with other strategic considerations, the
humiliating haste of the Lebanese pullout will likely encourage it
to factor in its deterrent image the next time it is challenged to
a shoot-out. &QL;

   A question from Shirley Gur in Shpinoza, Israel: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: A while ago, much was being discussed about the risk
of picking up bugs or viruses on flights. I even read somewhere
that air-conditioning systems are not good for passengers and that
airlines shut them down to save fuel and to sedate passengers to
relax them during the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of returning from London, I came down with a bad
throat infection. One friend arrived back from Barbados with a
raging stomach upset, while others have had respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Has the subject been put to sleep, so to speak, for lack of
evidence?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: No. Health in the air is of growing concern to
travelers, pilots, cabin crews and regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P>
   At 30,000 feet (9,150 meters) the air in a plane has to be
artificially created. At that altitude, the cabin is pressurized to
8,000 feet, the equivalent of sitting on top of a mountain.
(Outside air is too cold and thin for us to breathe.)
</P>
<P>
   Low air pressure makes your heart and lungs work harder. Low air
pressure can be dangerous for people prone to strokes or heart
disease.
</P>

   John Peppin, a reader in Torquay, England, reports having
``succumbed to unstable angina eight days after a flight of four

   Modern aircraft supply a mix of fresh and recirculated air in
the cabin, with the change rate as low as one every 10 minutes.

<P>
   Airlines can save up to 2 percent of fuel costs, representing
millions of dollars for a large carrier, by cutting in half the
quantity of air they bring into the cabin _ thereby recirculating
50 percent of cabin air. Turning off an air-conditioning pack not
only saves fuel but reduces noise in the cabin.

<P>
   Quality of air in the cabin also depends on the efficiency of

air particles 0.3 microns in size, which includes large bacteria
but excludes viruses.

   Richard Dawood, a London physician and the editor of

   A question from Shirley Gur in Shpinoza, Israel: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: A while ago, much was being discussed about the risk
of picking up bugs or viruses on flights. I even read somewhere
that air-conditioning systems are not good for passengers and that
airlines shut them down to save fuel and to sedate passengers to
relax them during the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of returning from London, I came down with a bad
throat infection. One friend arrived back from Barbados with a
raging stomach upset, while others have had respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Has the subject been put to sleep, so to speak, for lack of
evidence?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: No. Health in the air is of growing concern to
travelers, pilots, cabin crews and regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P>
   At 30,000 feet (9,150 meters) the air in a plane has to be
artificially created. At that altitude, the cabin is pressurized to
8,000 feet, the equivalent of sitting on top of a mountain.
(Outside air is too cold and thin for us to breathe.)
</P>
<P>
   Low air pressure makes your heart and lungs work harder. Low air
pressure can be dangerous for people prone to strokes or heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   John Peppin, a reader in Torquay, England, reports having
``succumbed to unstable angina eight days after a flight of four
and a half hours'' and cites rumors that airlines reduce cabin
pressure to 10,000 to 12,000 feet, an assertion that he says is

&HT;     EXPERTS WARN OF POWER OUTAGES IN SOUTWEST AND NORTHEAST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As temperatures soar this summer, consumers from
California to New York could find their air conditioners failing
and their lights dimming as electricity shortages caused by
stepped-up use of appliances cause brownouts and possibly
blackouts, experts warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is doing everything it can, but there are regions
at risk for power disruptions,'' said Eric Hirst, a member of the
Department of Energy's Task Force on Electric-System Reliability.
</P>
<P>
   A report from the North American Electric Reliability Council, a
public-private power alliance, lists areas at risk as New York, New
England, California, Arizona, New Mexico and southern Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the possible power shortages could come as a result
of the decade-long economic boom that has benefited much of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with cash and confident in the economy, Americans have
spent heavily on power-guzzling appliances, boosting demand for
electricity faster than capacity can keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many energy-efficiency and conservation programs created
in the 1970s after oil prices soared have been reduced. Since the
early 1990s, utilities have cut spending on such programs more than
50 percent, according to the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, deregulation of the electricity industry has not
helped the country deal with power shortages, Hirst said. Loosening
the rules that governed how power is produced, supplied and sold
was supposed to spur competition and efficiency. But the
four-year-old deregulation process has spawned more confusion than
improvement, he added. As a result, many utilities, uncertain how
deregulation would affect profits, have chosen to wait on building
new power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of combining this rising demand for electricity
with stagnating production has been that different regions around
the country are working with a smaller and smaller margin of
safety,'' Hirst said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has generating plants capable of producing
780,000 megawatts of electricity on a typical summer's day, and it
will take at least 700,000 megawatts to power the nation generally
this summer, according to Energy Department estimates.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves little surplus for times of extreme heat. In fact,
surplus electricity has been whittled by 60 percent during the last
decade, said Jim Owen, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute,
a Washington-based interest group made up of private electric
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Owen said the burgeoning high-tech industry, as well as firms
engaged in Internet commerce or otherwise dependent on e-mail and
similar online ways of doing business, are particularly vulnerable
to power shortages.
</P>
<P>
   For these types of companies, a blackout, or complete power
failure, can destroy their entire business operation, meaning
millions of dollars in losses for every minute their Web sites are
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Brownouts _ the partial reduction of electrical power _ also can
wreak havoc on sensitive equipment used in the high-tech industry.
For example, surges in power or intermittent cuts in power, even
those imperceptible to an office worker, can knock out a computer
or cause it to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   According to the experts, the country must do two things to
ensure a reliable power supply in the coming decades. First, new
power plants need to be built and the distribution system for
getting the electricity to factories and residential consumers must
be updated to handle the increased amount of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Second, people must be encouraged to reduce electricity
consumption by using energy-efficient bulbs, motors and appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The Edison Electric Institute offers these tips for reducing the
amount of electricity people use in their homes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Replace incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent
bulbs;
</P>
<P>
   _ Raise thermostats by 1 degree this summer;
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure homes are properly insulated;
</P>
<P>
   _ Have hot water systems checked.

government security men who refused him permission to tell his
story even in his hospital bed, on the Israelis who tried to
blackmail him into collaboration. And on his neighbors in the
pretty little Shiite Muslim hamlet, some of whom _ convinced that
he was a collaborator _ beat Abbas Koussan insensible after looting
his little shop. Why could Hezbollah not stop such acts of anarchy

   (UNDATED)_ Have you recently traveled somewhere and returned
with an unwelcome souvenir: a virus or ``bug?'' Well, you're not
alone. Travelers increasingly complain about getting sick from air
travel. Although the airlines deny it, they are cutting back on the
amount of recirculated air in the planes' cabins to save on fuel
costs and to sedate passengers....By Roger Collis, International

   JERUSALEM _ In its hasty withdrawal from southern Lebanon last

regard its withdrawal from occupied land as a step towards regional

rests on the distinction...By Abraham Rabinovich, International

   JERUSALEM _ A week after Israel's troops beat a hasty retreat
from Lebanon, Yasser Arafat has publicly acknowledged that he faces
growing political pressure to emulate the success of Hezbollah's
guerrilla forces. ``Hezbollah are being portrayed as heroes in the
Arab world, while the Palestinians look like losers,'' he
reportedly told an Israeli minister at a meeting in the West Bank.
``My situation is not simple,'' Arafat added. ``The pressure being
applied on me is coming from every direction.''...By Phil Reeves,

Abbas Koussan's battered face and body are a mark of shame on his

Taibe, on the U.N. troops who failed to protect him, on the
government security men who refused him permission to tell his
story even in his hospital bed, on the Israelis who tried to
blackmail him into collaboration. And on his neighbors in the
pretty little Shiite Muslim hamlet, some of whom _ convinced that
he was a collaborator _ beat Abbas Koussan insensible after looting
his little shop. Why could Hezbollah not stop such acts of anarchy
in a village which they controlled?...By Robert Fisk, The

&HT;     SEAN CONLEY PLACES SECOND IN NATIONAL SPELLING BEE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: New throughout.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sean Conley, a methodical and calm seventh-grader
from Newark, Calif., seized second place in the 73rd National
Spelling Bee Thursday, losing in the 14th round to another contest
veteran whom he identified from the start as his toughest
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The winner's trophy went to George Abraham Thampy of Maryland
Heights, Mo., who correctly spelled demarche _ a step or maneuver _
to win the 2000 Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there was barely a whisper in the crowded ballroom
of the Grand Hyatt Hotel when it came down to a duel between Sean
and George. Both were 12 years old, schooled at home and recognized
each other from last year when Sean tied for 9th place at the
national bee and George tied for 3rd.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Examiner sponsored Sean.
</P>
<P>
   The two-speller duel lasted only one round until Sean stumbled
on ``apotropaic'' _ safeguarding against evil.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd fell silent as he repeated it several times. He asked
about the word's origins. There was a long pause.
</P>
<P>
   Using his index finger, he traced out the letters on the back of
the yellow cardboard No. 20 tag around his neck. (No pens or
pencils are allowed.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he uttered: A-P-O-T-R-Y-P-A-I-C. The dreaded bell
clanged, sounding a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   His rival George then had to spell ``propaedeutic,'' which means
preparatory study or instruction. George nailed it to move ahead of
Sean.
</P>
<P>
   To clinch victory, George then had to spell another word
correctly _ and ``demarche'' gave him the first place prize.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the winner's trophy under the bright lights of cameras,
George said he would share the $10,000 prize with his parents and
said he hopes to study medicine. He said he prayed for help at the
end and that God came through.
</P>
<P>
   Sean put the best spin on his second place showing, claiming
that he was relieved that, as runner-up, he would avoid scores of
interviews on talk shows that tend to make him nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that disappointed,'' Sean said. ``I've still got
$5,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean said he knew all along that George ``was the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The 248 spellers that began on Wednesday were winnowed down to
only Sean and George on the stage. At that point, Sean said later,
``I was pretty sure I would lose because George was so good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just knew every single word. He must have studied pretty
much all his spare time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Conley, Sean's father, said he and his wife knew ``from the
moment we walked into this place that George was the man to beat.
He's a machine. He's very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean said once the tougher words started, he began tracing out
the letters on his number tag because ``I wanted to see what looked
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Before stumbling on ``apotropaic,'' he correctly spelled
``Mackinaw,'' ``ferriferous,'' ``luftmensch,'' ``vivace,''
``ramage,'' ``morceau,'' ``gourami,'' ``nonpareil,'' ``lucifugous''
and ``phrontistery.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother Bry Conley said Sean had his share of luck, including
getting the word ``luftmensch,'' a German word that means dreamer
and that he knew because she majored in the language at the
University of New Mexico and has tutored him in German.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Conley also said he had no trouble with ``vivace,'' which
means in a brisk manner, because Sean has seen it on sheet music
when playing the piano. ``It makes all those grumblings worth it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she also ``had a pretty good feeling it would come down
to him and George.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean, who hopes to start college at 16, ``has always loved
numbers and letters,'' said his mother.

 JAPAN'S GOLF BOOM OF THE '80s ENDING IN DISASTER FOR BANKS AND By HOWARD W. FRENCH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ During the economic boom in the 1980s, few things
reflected this country's exploding wealth better than its sudden
madness for golf.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation of badly overcrowded cities and itsy-bitsy homes,
wide, lush fairways were constructed at such a clip that by the end
of the decade there were 2,400 courses, covering an area roughly
triple the size of Tokyo itself. Lavish clubhouses included
expensive artwork from masters like Chagall and Monet and solid
gold fixtures. Bankers and promoters were financing memberships _
for up to $200,000 each _ as investments that they predicted would
take off like a well-hit tee shot.
</P>
<P>
   But the golf club investment craze here ran into trouble when
Japan's economic bubble burst 10 years ago. Personal bankruptcies
rose, the value of club memberships fell and many courses were
immediately in a financial hole.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at least 1,700 of the country's golf courses are either
bankrupt or in financial trouble, according to industry estimates.
And the bankers and other lenders who financed the courses and the
individual memberships are desperately trying to contain one of the
the economy's biggest problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to exactly calculate the extent of the
bad loan problem in this country,'' said Takehito Sasaki, managing
director at PricewaterhouseCoopers, Japan. ``Some people estimate
it at $1.2 trillion. Maybe 20 percent of that is related to the
golf course crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in that is an estimated $95 billion in
non-interest-bearing security deposits on club memberships that are
tied up in distressed clubs _ more than the gross domestic product
of Ireland or Singapore or New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of club memberships are now maturing for the first
time, meaning that subscribers may demand reimbursement from the
clubs, and many Japanese are realizing for the first time the
extent of their losses. In short, the clubs have little or nothing
to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis over golf course debt comes at a time when Japan is
having some success in whittling down other types of unconventional
debt, like loans to so-called love hotels, and to Pachinko parlors,
both of which were linked to the country's speculative boom in the
1980s. Debt in both industries has been sold recently at steep
discounts to investment banks in the United States and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's golf crisis is coming to a head right now for reasons
that have to do with the Ponzi scheme nature of the business, and
the almost lemming-like zeal with which ordinary Japanese ponied up
to become players. With the eager encouragement of banks that were
lending both to golfers and developers, memberships were sold as
investments with the promise that they could be cashed in after 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our orders were to market financial products, and to find as
many customers as possible,'' said one former bank employee, who
insisted on anonymity. ``We were not encouraged to ask many
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The slick young agents who were peddling these ``investments,''
were quick to add that it would be foolish to cash in, because the
memberships could always be sold to others at a rich profit.
</P>
<P>
   With Japan's economy looking as if it were enjoying an endless
ascent, middle-class people took out loans to ``invest'' in club
memberships, which sold anywhere from $50,000 to $200,000,
convinced that their memberships would double or triple in value _
as they did for a time _ every two or three years. Typically, the
same banks that were lending to golf course developers were
promoting loans linked to their clubs, without the slightest
disclosure of conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks were lending as much as 20 million yen to their
customers to get them to become members of golf courses,'' said
Seijiro Takayama, a lawyer who has represented many people who have
lost their fortunes in memberships that have turned worthless, but
with little success. ``The banks were not reporting to the
investors about the state of the clubs, nor were they inspecting
these individuals' finances either.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuichi Yamashita, an official of the Golf Management Research
Institute, a consulting company. said: ``There were cases where
really bad people deliberately swindled people. But that is only
part of it. This is the failure of people who turned the golf
business into a money making machine. There are many companies who
saw that this area is very profitable, and advanced into it even
though they knew little about this field. There were all kind of
consultants urging people into the business as a source of easy
profits.''

 TOKYO: easy profits.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This kind of misfortune has led to a new boom in at least two
sectors: loan collecting, and the protection racket. Takayama said
that Japanese yakuza, or organized crime groups, were offering
their services to golf club members who had lost their personal
savings in the debacle. Playing the other side of the street too,
sometimes simultaneously, the gangsters have also been employed by
golf clubs' management to scare members out of filing lawsuits to
recover their investments.
</P>
<P>
   For Michiko Fujii, a 64-year-old deputy director of a golf
school, who saw club memberships investments as the perfect adjunct
to her work, news of the collapse of the Omon Golf Club, in Tochigi
prefecture north of Tokyo, one of her five memberships, came in the
form of a simple postcard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought it in January 1989, and for two years heard nothing
from them,'' Fujii said. ``Then I received a postcard saying that
they wanted to explain the condition of the club. Shortly
afterward, we learned that the club had already been seized by a
financial company in Osaka, and the caddies and instructors had
already all been fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Other clubs have collapsed but have been forced by the courts to
allow their members to continue playing until they are ultimately
liquidated. And some clubs continue to function more or less
normally, with their memberships traded actively, almost like
futures, but at steep discounts
</P>
<P>
   Fujii paid 9.8 million yen, or $90,740 at current exchange
rates, for a membership in the Nishikata Golf Club, a decade ago.
And as an early entry into the membership pool, she once thought
she had gotten a terrific deal. Others eventually paid three times
as much.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a membership in that club can be picked up for less than
$300. And still there are few takers. What is worse, many of the
golf courses that remain open are so hard up for money that they
gladly accept flat, cheap day rates for nonmembers, destroying the
last shred of exclusivity that had surrounded the clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the banks were the most guilty party, an angry Fujii
said. There was always some credit company ready to lend money for
memberships. They were allied with the golf courses, telling
people, anyone can get a loan like this, and if you buy the
membership, the price will steadily rise. And many people were
tricked.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also feel responsibility. I listened to the promoters
who told me that if you buy something in Japan that is tied to the
price of land, it's value will never go down. I listened to these
people and my judgment failed.''

WHEN THE PEN IS DEADLIER THAN THE SWORD

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his spare time, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's Chief of Staff
Dr. Paul Hackmeyer is refining his looping technique.
</P>
<P>
   No, he's not honing his suture skills, nor is he simulating
precise hand maneuvers for delicate open-heart surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Hackmeyer is learning penmanship all over again, hoping to
eliminate those cursive writing pitfalls that _ whether fairly or
unfairly _ have earned doctors a bad rap among professionals as
chicken-scratching scribes.
</P>
<P>
   Along with some 75 other Cedars-Sinai colleagues last month, he
took a voluntary class to improve handwriting, part of the
hospital's mission this year to emphasize patient safety.
</P>
<P>
   Since a national study last year by the Institute of Medicine
found that about 50 percent of medication errors in hospitals stem
from the prescription ordering process, improving the legibility of
doctors' handwritten prescriptions seemed a vital piece of the
patient safety puzzle, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   In worst-case scenarios, simple errors could turn deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the widely publicized 1999 Texas case in
which a widow won a $450,000 settlement after her husband died from
taking the wrong medication he received from a pharmacist who
misread a doctor's poor penmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tragic situation certainly is a cautionary tale for
everyone in the medical profession,'' said Hackmeyer, who also
cited staff surveys that found handwritten correspondence between
physicians and nurses often required time-consuming clarification
and upset staff relations.
</P>
<P>
   Cedars-Sinai enticed doctors to class with a contest that asked
them to decode handwritten reports of two of the more
handwriting-challenged doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The grand prize was a Sunday brunch for two at the Four Seasons
Hotel in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Hackmeyer is still surprised so many doctors lined up to change
their scribbling ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all took it in spirit,'' recalled Dr. Andrew
Wachtel, a pulmonary medicine specialist whose only failing grades
in elementary school were for penmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, his handwriting in his adult life is at its worst
when he's hurried, or standing up to fill out bedside charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just doctors who have bad handwriting, but with
doctors, it shows more to other people and it can be the difference
between life and death,'' said Barbara Getty, one of two nationally
renowned handwriting experts from Portland, Ore., who coached
Cedars-Sinai's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Getty and Inga Dubay, both former teachers at the elementary and
college level, co-authored the handwriting reform manual ``Write
Now'' (Portland State University, Continuing Education Press,
1991).
</P>
<P>
   Their book and seminars teach adults and children an easy
flowing italic style for both printed and cursive forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the difference between the two as joined printing,''
explained Getty. ``It's less awkward to make the transition between
the two.''
</P>
<P>
   And the italic style has fewer pen strokes and ``looping,'' the
main feature of traditional cursive writing that tends to tangle,
run astray or leave letters incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   One misstroke can contort an ``A'' into a ``U,'' or add letters
that weren't intended.
</P>
<P>
   Italics enable doctors to write speedily, Getty said, but added,
``the bottom line is legibility. People have to read what you
write.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacist Nick Movsessian, who works at Costco Wholesale stores
throughout the San Fernando Valley, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides patient safety, he worries he will be held liable for
such a mistake, regardless of whether the doctor's handwritten
prescription was legible.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, Movsessian and co-workers double-check every
technician's computer-generated prescription label against the
doctor's original handwritten prescription before filling
prescription bottles.
</P>
<P>
   If there's any doubt, they call the doctor _ a process that
sometimes delays patient orders one working day.
</P>
<P>
   And since hundreds of medications are similarly spelled, he says
that's common.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a big concern,'' said Movsessian. ``And these
types of problems are more prevalent than people care to think.''
</P>
<P>
   A scribbled order for the antidepressant ``Prozac'' easily can
resemble the ulcer drug ``Prilosec'' he noted as an example.
</P>
<P>
   And to add more confusion, both drugs come in dosages of 10, 20
and 40 milligrams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question, if doctors slow down and print, it would
solve a lot of problems,'' said Movsessian.
</P>
<P>
   More high-tech solutions also are on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel currently sits on a Cedars-Sinai committee hoping to
incorporate within two to five years a digital-entry prescription
ordering system to replace the handwritten method, as the hospital
did three years ago with patient charts and physician reports.
</P>
<P>
   But as a precaution until then, most doctors at the hospital are
telephoning pharmacies to verify prescriptions, while others are
practicing penmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, big strides in penmanship won't happen overnight,
so Getty and Dubay tell doctors to at least make the extra effort
with prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself, I loop too much. And in looping, it goes too much into
the next letter,'' said Hackmeyer. ``But I'm going to slow down and
take the time to use these techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Wachtel, ``It's a humbling experience. But I'm willing to
keep practicing and trying at it. Everybody wants to take better
care of the patients. That's what we're all about.'' &QL;

POLITICAL MOTIVE SUSPECTED IN KILLING OF MONTENEGRIN AIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia _ The shooting death Wednesday night of a
top aide to the president of Montenegro is being widely interpreted
here as a political attack on the West-leaning government.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Zugic, 39, the security adviser to Montenegro's president,
Milo Djukanovic, was gunned down as he arrived home shortly after
11 p.m. outside the modest apartment block where he lived with his
wife and two young children. His murder follows several
high-profile killings in recent months in Serbia, but is the first
such death in Montenegro, Serbia's smaller partner in the Yugoslav
federation.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it has shocked the population here and has shaken the
government, which has been trying to steer a peaceful course away
from Belgrade's control and the isolationist policies of President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. The timing, just a week ahead of
local elections in which pro-Milosevic parties are pitched against
the Montenegrin government and its allies, raised speculation that
the killing was an attempt by Belgrade to destabilize the political
process.
</P>
<P>
   Looking stern and upset as he spoke at a memorial service for
his adviser, Djukanovic said, ``It looks like a terrorist act
against democracy and against the security of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Zugic, a trained lawyer who had made his career in the security
service and became security adviser to the president two years ago,
had worked for peace and democracy, the president said. ``After all
the efforts to keep the peace and take care of the people, and in
the end this happens,'' Djukanovic said. ``We are not used to such
aggression. We usually try to make friends out of our enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing will discourage us from working for democracy. The
whole of Montenegro is with you,'' he told a packed hall of
government officials and Zugic's wife and family.
</P>
<P>
   He described the murder as political, as did other government
officials and politicians, and said it had all the hallmarks of
recent assassinations in Serbia. But he vowed that unlike those
murders, he would not leave it unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia has witnessed the slaying of four prominent political and
business figures in as many months, among other gangland style
killings. The notorious paramilitary leader, Zeljko Raznatovic,
better known as Arkan, and Milosevic's defense minister, Pavle
Bulatovic, were both shot dead by gunmen earlier this year. A few
weeks later the head of Yugoslav Airlines was shot outside his
apartment, and then a representative of Milosevic's Serbian
Socialist Party, Bosko Perosevic, was killed last month in
apparently unrelated incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Podgorica, which remains an easy-going provincial
town where both the president and prime minister frequent cafes and
restaurants with only minimum security, spoke of shock at the fact
that the gun violence of Belgrade has come to their town.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's leading independent newspaper, Vijesti, which
reported the killing in its last edition, was sold out unusually
early, by 10.30 a.m. ``It is a very big story, we are all in a
state of shock that what has been happening in Belgrade should
happen in Podgorica,'' a reporter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin justice minister, Dragan Soc, told reporters
that the killing looked like a political assassination and
expressed hope that it would not trigger a wave of unresolved
crimes in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with a murder like those we have seen outside
Montenegro, and that is disturbing,'' he said, declining to
speculate on motives. ``We are shocked but not surprised,'' said
Miroslav Vickovic, a parliamentarian and opposition leader. ``It
shows the line between the political and the criminal is
disappearing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Police acted quickly after the murder, sealing exits form the
city and stopping and searching every car on the streets. Witnesses
reported that they heard two bursts of automatic gunfire and saw a
lone gunman flee on foot, the Reuters news agency reported. The
city was calm Thursday with no visible extra security. Guric will
be buried Friday at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade made little comment about the killing, and Nikola
Sainovic, a senior official in Milosevic's governing party, said it
should not be linked to the murders in Serbia. ``I wouldn't draw
any parallel,'' he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic had been scheduled to visit Montenegro on June 8 for a
political rally of his supporters ahead of the municipal elections.
On Thursday Momir Bulatovic, the Yugoslav prime minister and the
leader of the pro-Milosevic Socialist People's Party in Montenegro,
denied that Milosevic was concerned about security but said that
the party would decide in coming days whether the president would
attend the rally.

   The prehistoric creatures in Disney's ``Dinosaur'' were
originally going to communicate through voiceover narration until
the filmmakers decided that having them talk would be a better
call. Judging from the film's first six minutes, silence would have
been the best option of all. But even the dinosaurs' most infantile
musings are preferable to the interminable and mundane ruminations
of the mixed-up horse in ``Running Free.''
</P>
<P>
   This exquisitely shot kids movie suffers from the fatal decision
to have a human voice (Lukas Haas, the Amish boy in ``Witness'')
narrate every thought, feeling and reflection of the
ever-so-sensitive orphaned horse, Lucky. That means when Lucky has
lost his mother, we can't just watch him scan the distance with a
forlorn look in those big, brown eyes. Instead, we hear him whine:
``I had to find my mother. Why didn't they understand I needed to
be with my mother?''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky's long-winded bleatings don't end there. Lucky on
ambition: ``I had to find my place in the world. It was time for me
to set out into an unknown world, where I would be as wild and free
as in my dreams.'' Lucky on the need for companionship: ``I started
to feel lonely. I had nobody.'' Lucky on freedom: ``I would rather
die than bow to Caesar.''
</P>
<P>
   Caesar, you see, is the bad horsie who rules the ranch at the
South African mining town where Lucky finds himself. Lucky, his mom
and other (less talkative) horses were sent to this godforsaken
place from Germany. Lucky, just a colt, finds a friend in a fellow
orphan, a stable boy, Richard (Chase Moore). Lucky's mom isn't so,
well, lucky, running afoul of the villainous Caesar, which sets up
an eventual corral showdown that is anything but OK.
</P>
<P>
   Russian director Sergei Bodrov, making his English-language
feature debut, captures the bare beauty of the Namibian desert and
comes away with some fine footage of his equine actors. It's too
bad he couldn't trust his images to convey the essence of the
story, which, for the most part, they do.
</P>
<P>
   Failing that, ``Running Free'' could have used some clever,
intelligent writing on the order of the 1994 ``Black Beauty''
remake which had Alan Cumming providing the horse's voice to fine
effect. There's nothing remotely like that here for narrator Haas,
rendering Lucky a nag in a thoroughbred arena. Place your bet on
another movie. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The film: ``Running Free'' (G; for all audiences). &QL; 
The stars: Chase Moore. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Sergei Bodrov. Screenplay by Jeanne
Rosenberg. Based on a story by Rosenberg and Jean-Jacques Annaud.

   What's a nice, Cambridge-educated arthouse flower like Thandie
Newton doing in the fuel-injected commercial head-banger ``M:I-2''?
</P>
<P>
   Having a pretty good time, according to the usually lithe (now 5
months pregnant) British actress, and trying to inject a modicum of
humanity into the John Woo-directed, Tom Cruise adrenaline fest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Completely out of the blue, I got a call from my agent to meet
Tom and John at a hotel in London for `Mission: Impossible 2,' and
I just thought it was a fantastic idea,'' the 27-year-old Newton
says of the widely hyped sequel, whose debut gross of $$70.8
million over the Memorial Day weekend probably surpasses that of
all her previous films combined (if you don't count her first
Cruise collaboration, ``Interview With the Vampire,'' in which she
had a small role). ``The combination of John Woo's style and Tom
Cruise just seemed perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd known Tom for a few years and was completely in awe of
John, which made it really exciting,'' Newton adds, admitting that,
though no action-film fan, she finds the Hong Kong director's
hyper-aestheticized approach to violence and melodrama enchanting.
``They told me how they wanted the film to be more of a love story,
which sounded great to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In what passes for a narrative between ``M:I-2's'' action
explosions, Newton plays Nyah Hall, a master jewel thief recruited
by Cruise's superspy Ethan Hunt to help stop her former lover,
Dougray Scott's Sean Ambrose, from unleashing a deadly supervirus
in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, Hunt and Hall fall in love before he
places her in extreme physical and emotional jeopardy. While she
gets in on some of the action _ a little cliffhanging, a ridiculous
but nonetheless erotically turbo-charged car race down a curvy road
_ Newton's main assignment is to provide the abstract demolition
derby with something resembling heart and feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Not an easy commission in a production machine-tooled to
showcase its male star's (who was also one of its producers)
athletic derring-do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look a lot, you do a lot of homework to find a leading
lady for Tom,'' says Cruise's producing partner Paula Wagner.
``Thandie Newton is a phenomenal actress and we'd been watching her
work for quite a while. Interestingly enough, (Cruise's wife)
Nicole Kidman had worked with her in 'Flirting,' and was very
supportive of this idea. But we had been looking, and we wanted to
find somebody interesting who had depth and range and a certain
kind of sophistication, a sense of elegance and fun and that kind
of mysterious beauty that she has. We just fell in love with her.''
</P>
<P>
   One consideration that evidently remained unmentioned throughout
casting and production was race. Newton, whose mother is Zimbabwean
and whose father is English, is never once identified as a person
of African heritage in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Which she, with characteristic enthusiasm, approved of,
especially in light of a career that's been defined by
race-identified roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not important to the story; what's important are other
things about the person,'' she notes. ``Which is groundbreaking,
sure, because often the predominant factor seems to be color, when
there is so much more that is really intriguing about a person. You
don't really know anything by knowing someone's color; you know
nothing, in fact. So it's just the smart thing to do to think
beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, it looks good, too,'' she adds with a laugh. ``It's kind
of exotic and suggests a bigger world.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton, who trained to become a dancer before injuries
redirected her interests toward acting and her university subject,
anthropology, was 16 when she made her movie debut in ``Flirting''
as an African exchange student at an Australian boarding school.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to play American slaves, the famous Sally Hemings
among them, in ``Jefferson in Paris,'' ``The Journey of August
King'' and ``Vampire,'' and the demonic spirit of a slave's
murdered daughter in Oprah Winfrey's film adaptation of Toni
Morrison's ``Beloved.'' Last year, she was seen as an African
political refugee in Italy, who is reluctantly drawn into an
obsessive relationship with an English composer in Bernardo
Bertolucci's ``Besieged.''
</P>
<P>
   That performance, which Newton based to some degree on her
mother, now bears unfortunate real-life echoes. The current
socio-economic strife in Zimbabwe, which is leading to increased
political and ethnic violence as a crucial election approaches,
troubles Newton greatly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my family is there,'' she says. ``What you see in the news
tends to be the hot zones of unrest; all we've got is the phone,
and I get on there to make sure that my relatives aren't involved.
But it's a frightening time and it's hard to imagine it happening,
because it's such a beautiful part of the world. It was, up until
this, a place which was really something to be proud of. Not that
I'm not proud of Zimbabwe now, but I just feel terribly sorry for
the civilians who are caught up in the unrest. It had to happen at
some point, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The future holds more pleasant prospects at home in London.
Besides expecting their first child, Newton and her screenwriter
husband, Ol Parker, are looking forward to the release of a
suspense-comedy they worked on together called ``It Was an
Accident.'' They're also building a house, a process the symbol of
international film glamour says she revels in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really involved in all the aspects of building it,'' she
explains. ``I love to paint, I love carpentry, I love making
things. I'm the most unglamorous person ... If you come to my
house, you'll find me in a pair of overalls with a piece of wood in
one hand and sandpaper in the other. That's when I feel most
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, and we thought dangling from a teetering car over a steep,
rocky canyon was the most fun any actress could dream of having.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, that was terrifying,'' Newton says. ``I mean, it
was all safe, there were a few ropes tied to me to keep me from
tumbling all the way down. But I did have to fall out of the car
and hang there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they scheduled that whole thing for my last day of
shooting,'' she says with comically exaggerated indignation,
``which I thought was a bit tactless. I guess it was just in case
anything went wrong.''

THE NEW BANKRUPTCY REFORM: MAKE THE RICH PLAN AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas, S.D., Iowa, Kan.)  By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The market for million-dollar homes in Florida and Texas has
long been stimulated by the fact that such houses appeal to one
particular class of wealthy people _ those who are about to file
for bankruptcy. Now Congress is about to increase the appeal of
such homes to rich people who may not face imminent bankruptcy, but
see it as a possibility if they lose a big lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The unlimited homestead exemption in those two states _ as well
as in South Dakota, Iowa and Kansas, although relocating deadbeats
tend to prefer Boca Raton winters to those of Sioux Falls _ has
long been the most obvious way that people with a lot of assets can
abuse the bankruptcy code.
</P>
<P>
   Go broke owning a $10 million mortgage-free house in Houston,
and you can stiff your creditors while you keep the house. Once you
emerge from bankruptcy, you can sell the house and use the cash to
maintain the lifestyle you think you deserve. So high-livers tend
to move from New York, where the homestead exemption is $10,000, to
Florida or Texas before they file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy bill passed by the House did nothing to deal with
that abuse, but after a bruising floor fight, the Senate voted to
cap the homestead exemption at $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now, meeting behind closed doors, a compromise has been reached,
and the senators fighting that abuse have tentatively signed off on
it. It will be pitched as a meaningful reform, one that will reduce
the abuse. But the reduction is likely to be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the unlimited Florida and Texas exemptions
will be available only to those who have lived in the states for at
least two years before they file for bankruptcy. And even for them,
the exemption will be limited to the amount of equity that the
person had in the home two years before filing, plus $100,000.
Somebody who moves to Florida just before filing will be out of
luck. If fraud can be proved, something that is never easy, money
put into a house up to seven years before filing may be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that many once-rich people can plan for going
broke, stalling off creditors and appealing judgments while the
two-year clock is ticking. ``It just says, be sure not to wait too
long to get your house in Texas or Florida,'' says Elizabeth
Warren, a Harvard law professor.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also will put a limit of $1 million on the amount a
person can squirrel away in an individual retirement account immune
from creditors. But it won't do anything about a myriad of other
ways, often involving trusts, that money can be protected from
creditors. Congress decided not to put a cap on such maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the once-wealthy who take the trouble to plan will
still be able to hold on to assets while creditors suffer, the bill
that emerges from Congress is sure to make life harder on most of
those who file for bankruptcy _ usually after a divorce, job loss
or severe illness. The credit card companies will collect more of
what they are owed.
</P>
<P>
   The supposed urgency of bankruptcy legislation came from a rapid
rise in the number of bankruptcy filings. That surge has ended, and
the number of new cases is falling. But this is a bill with
momentum, and final passage is likely if a few disputes _ including
one related to judgments against abortion protesters _ can be
settled. The new law will do a lot to cut out abuses by people who
were just scraping by before they went broke, but much less to
eliminate abuses by people who were rich before a judge ordered
them to repay people they had defrauded.
</P>
<P>
   They will call that reform.

BLACK TO BASICS

By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a recent awards show, country superstar Clint Black ignored
his just-won silver-plated trophy _ and reached for another sort of
reward: wife Lisa Hartman Black.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody seemed surprised. A country traditionalist from the Texas
heartland, Black was one of the first artists to kick-start
country's mass popularity in the '90s. And he did it by sticking
true to country's ideals _ heart, home and healthy respect for the
fans.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken, humorous guy, Black was in town recently to pick
up a statuette from the Academy of Country Music for his
chart-topping hit, ``When I Said I Do,'' a touching duet with his
wife affirming the importance of a loving marriage. Black wrote and
produced the song, as well as producing and directing the video.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I Said I Do'' was the first single from Black's ninth and
current album, ``D'lectrified.'' The exclusively acoustic disc
features a rich spectrum of sound and draws on a number of country
styles while cameos come from such diverse names as comedians Eric
Idle and Kevin Nealon, country stars Waylon Jennings, Steve Wariner
and Marty Stuart, and rockers Bruce Hornsby and Edgar Winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd wanted to do an `unplugged' album for a while,'' Black,
37, said backstage at the 35th annual Academy of Country Music
Awards at Universal Amphitheatre. ``There was no reason not to do
one. It looked like it would be an easy process. Then I started
thinking about it, and I felt I wasn't throwing myself enough curve
balls. It just didn't seem challenging enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Black appears Aug. 27 at the Greek Theatre. At 8 p.m. Tuesday,
the A&AMP;E Network will debut a ``Biography'' on the singer covering
his roots in Katy, Texas, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely a core artist for this station and the entire
country format,'' said R.J. Curtis, operations manager at local
country station KZLA-FM (93.9). ``If you do any kind of music
research and artist testing, his name comes up often as a huge
favorite of listeners.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said the duet, ``When I Said I Do,'' had received more
than 1,000 spins at KZLA in heavy rotation since its release in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets played several times a day,'' he said. ``People are
very passionate about it.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Black said he always knew he'd eventually record a
duet with Lisa Hartman Black when the right song came along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took that for granted,'' he explained as he motioned to the
country academy trophy for top vocal event of the year. ``I knew
the right tune would make it happen. You should have seen her face
when they called our name.''
</P>
<P>
   Black joked that since he got married, the most frequently asked
questions have been when are he and his wife going to make a
record, a movie and a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got two of the three down,'' Black said, clearing his
throat. ``We're practicing on the third.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other popular country acts, Black is equally inspired by
pop and country. It's been said that without Black paving the way,
there wouldn't be a Garth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New Jersey, but raised in a Houston, Texas, suburb,
Black didn't take up guitar until the age of 13 when he started
playing harmonica. Two years later, he began writing songs,
eventually landing gigs in local coffeehouses, bars and clubs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Black met singer-songwriter Hayden Nicholas, and the
two began collaborating and recording demos. A tape of their songs
made its way to ZZ Top manager Bill Ham, who quickly signed Black
and got him a deal with RCA Nashville by the end of 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Black's first single, ``A Better Man,'' went to No. 1, and a
star was born. For Black, awards season had begun in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to win these things, but you have to keep in mind
they are the result of your fan base,'' Black said. ``That's what
you have to keep being thankful for. That people out there buy your
records and come to your shows. That's the biggest reward of all.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said he himself remains a fan, especially of Loggins, who
appears on ``D'lectrified.''
</P>
<P>
   Loggins, Black says, is ``the singer I aspire to be as good as.
He had all the range, emotion and soul I wanted when I was a kid.
Here he was in my studio.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Black said he had to stop twiddling the dials long
enough to give thanks for a long career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was more than I expected,'' he said. ``I never expected
much more than, `get a record deal and get on stage.' I had to stop
for a minute or two and just take it all in.'' &QL;

Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sensuous well past the point of delirium, Claire Denis' ``Beau
Travail'' is an insistently poetic ode to, well, guys with their
shirts off. Loosely based on Melville's ``Billy Budd,'' transposed
to a 20th-century Foreign Legion outpost in the barren African
enclave of Djibouti and with the homoerotic implications amped up a
couple of megatons, this French production, while unfailingly
beautiful, seems always, oppressively on the verge of an incoherent
swoon.
</P>
<P>
   With minimal dialogue and an editing strategy that's less
concerned with narrative flow than artistically juxtaposing
textures of desert, water and flesh, ``Beau Travail's'' primary
concern (after muscles) is ritualism. Most of the screen time is
devoted to detailing the Legion's young recruits at their
exercises, maneuvers, chores and what even appears to be downtime
organized for maximum group bonding impact. For most, this will
have the movie equivalent effect of nodding off in church.
</P>
<P>
   In an isolated culture like the Legion's, it's little wonder
that Sgt. Galoup (Denis Lavant, the ``Lovers on the Bridge'' actor
with the evocatively ravaged face), who's thoughts we hear
regularly on the soundtrack, has a borderline psychotic need to
preserve his idea of corps propriety. He mentions something about
``rumors'' once spread regarding the veteran commander (Michel
Subor) to whom Galoup is devoted, and determines to destroy a
popular new arrival, Legionnaire Sentain (Gregorie Colin), before
he does harm to the executive officer's reputation _ or so he keeps
telling himself, and us, though his true, unexamined motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Director Denis, who grew up in Africa, has a marvelous eye for
the continent's natural and human wonders. That was evident in her
first feature, ``Chocolat,'' 11 years ago, and is made only more
intensely apparent in ``Beau Travail'' by the tactile camerawork of
Agnes Godard, who shot last year's stirring ``Dreamlife of Angels''
and is clearly in the top rank of France's young cinematographers.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Chocolat,'' which was presumed to be
semi-autobiographical, had an emotional immediacy and tragic
inevitability that the new movie, with its sculpted aesthetic
agenda, never approximates. Denis and company do, however, give
Michelangelo a run for his money. &QL; 
_____ &QL;

violence). &QL;

   HYBRID-CARS (Washington) _ Gasoline-electric cars can be clean
and extremely fuel-efficient, but when it comes to pollution,
engineers are learning that hybrids cannot accomplish everything
that environmentalists want. That point was demonstrated at the
American Tour de Sol race here on May 18. The alternative-vehicle
race showed that hybrids did better on fuel economy than some of
the electrics, but caused more emissions of gases that are thought
to cause climate change. By Matthew L. Wald. &QL;

   The recent pair of computer virus scares sparked a few thoughts,
particularly as I plowed into the massive paperback version of
``Cryptonomicon,'' sci-fi hotshot Neal Stephenson's latest
crackerjack read.
</P>
<P>
   It was Stephenson's ``Snow Crash'' that envisioned a
three-dimensional cyberworld where human-looking online avatars
exchange virtual documents by literally handing them to one
another. One lethal troublemaker hands out virtual notes laced with
viruses capable of wiping clean the recipient's brain functions,
literally leaving only TV-like ``snow'' on the mind's screen.
</P>
<P>
   We're a long way from viruses that actually directly affect
human health (unless you count the alleged addictive nature of
online conversation for some users). But the I Love You virus'
quick propagation across the planet showed how widespread our
connections with each other already are, and how vulnerable we can
be to electronic disruption on a wide scale.
</P>
<P>
   I received eight of the corrupted I Love You e-mails (and five
warnings not to open them), but given the current state of my
romantic endeavors, felt pretty sure none of my correspondents
could claim any such warm, much less identical, sentiments toward
me. So I didn't open any of them.
</P>
<P>
   That saved me some grief, because the problems started when
people opened the attachments. Lesson 1: Know who's sending you
something, and why, before you open any attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 2: There aren't many attachments you should ever open,
especially those with more unusual suffixes like .exe (for an
``executable'' file that can automatically run a mini-program when
opened) or .vbs (again, for a program written in the Visual Basic
language).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that means you'll miss some of the little pieces of
goofball comedy that float around the Net.
</P>
<P>
   But here's Lesson 3: If your friends truly love you, they'll
save everyone some time, bandwidth and headaches by sending you a
link to a site where such goofball stuff resides, instead of a big
fat attachment. Then you can decide whether to download and run the
piece more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, you'll help the site build up traffic, so it can get more
advertisers and outlast the little drabs of investment capital
financing its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 4 is that anti-virus programs can work, but are pretty
worthless in the first assault of a new virtual beast. The programs
have to be updated to spot the virus (which the big anti-virus
makers quickly did), or they can't catch it coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 5: Always backup the stuff you care about. What would be
a huge pain to replace if your computer's hard drive was wiped
clean by a virus? For me, it's the contact information and calendar
that run my life, and a few digital photos of my children.
Regularly drag copies of that information to a floppy disk or
online storage site (your Internet service provider probably gives
you a few megabytes of space, and companies such as X:drive
(www.xdrive.com) and i-drive (www.idrive.com) provide much more for
free.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 6 might be the subtlest, but most important of all. Some
online commentators pointed out, and National Public Radio satirist
Harry Shearer picked up on, how infrequently most news reports
mentioned that the virus only attacked users of a specific
operating system, Windows, and e-mail program, Outlook Express,
from a single company, Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   If you use a Macintosh or a mainframe, you were safe. If you use
Eudora or Netscape Communicator, you were safe.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just a ``computer virus'' that caused the mess, which
is how most news reports termed the problems. It was a Microsoft
Windows and Outlook Express virus that caused the mess.
</P>
<P>
   And because so many of us use those programs, the virus could
spread rapidly. To make a biological metaphor, the Internet is
suffering from a lack of diversity in its ecosphere. Just as any
species in the wild with a lack of genetic diversity can be wiped
out by a virus-borne disease, so, too, the Net was vulnerable
because too many people use the same programs.
</P>
<P>
   So ponder how much you want to be like everyone else the next
time you choose a computer, or operating system, or e-mail client.
Standards have their place, goodness knows, in this fractured
computing world. But there's a lesson here for the virtual world:
diversify or (watch your hard drive) die. &QL;

INCREASE IN REFUGEES COULD WORSEN FOOD CRISIS IN ERITREA 
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea _ A few weeks ago, Abrehet Amdimeskel was simply
a student, who happened to be in English class when the war with
Ethiopia came to her town in southern Eritrea. Now, at 14, she is
the head of her uprooted household, caring for her grandmother and
four younger siblings in a small tent in a huge refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   As towns like hers emptied out, she lost track of her parents
and two other siblings, and can only hope they found their way to
some other camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want peace,'' she said in a camp of about 37,000 refugees
in the town of Dadu, 30 miles northwest of the capital, Asmara.
``We want this to stop. We don't know anything about this war.''
She started to cry but would not let herself.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days Ethiopia and Eritrea seem finally to have
made progress toward ending their two-year war. But relief
officials say it is far from certain that the hundreds of thousands
of people displaced in the last three weeks of intense fighting
will go home anytime soon. Ethiopia on Wednesday declared the war
over, but there is no cease-fire yet and many people, relief
officials say, will simply be too afraid to return. Complicating
the problem is the worry that this refugee crisis could make the
food shortages in Eritrea, which are already bad, far worse. Most
of the refugees are from the southwest, the Gash Barka region,
which produces two-thirds of the nation's grain, according to the
U.N. World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonal rains _ and thus the main planting season _ are
expected to start in the next two weeks. If the displaced cannot
get home to plant, said Bruce Orina, a spokesman here for the
International Committee of the Red Cross, ``We are talking about
potentially a grim situation as food security is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, war and drought have reduced the Gash Barka region's
harvest by 90 percent, the World Food Program estimates, and
770,000 people faced food shortages even before this latest round
of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other area in Eritrea that can fill that gap,''
said Lindsey Davies, a spokeswoman for the agency here in Asmara.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the United Nations began airlifting tons of food for
the short-term, and other relief groups are scrambling to provide
essentials like blankets, tents, cooking pots and clean water. All
are in short supply, relief officials say, though it is possible
the needs will evaporate if peace talks in Algeria produce a final
cease-fire and everyone goes home.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What has become clearer in the last few days, though, is just
how many people were uprooted from their homes after Ethiopia
launched a major offensive on May 12, pushing through the trenches
along the nations' disputed border and into the places where people
actually live.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, thousands of Eritreans have been moving
along the roads, particularly along the border areas south of
Asmara, flowing north to escape fierce fighting with almost nothing
in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enemy was shelling with heavy artillery,'' said Negisti
Tesfu, 35, a mother of six who fled from her home near Adi Quala
five days before to a camp in Dbarwa, some 12 miles south of
Asmara. ``There were air bombardments. So I was forced to leave.''
She said at least one child was killed, a 5-year-old boy, along
with six cows and two donkeys. She said her home was demolished.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the Eritrean government estimated that about 550,000
people were displaced _ a number that Ethiopia said was propaganda
aimed at building sympathy abroad. That would have meant that more
than 1 in 10 people were displaced in a nation of 3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Davies of the World Food Program said that her agency now
believed that the estimate was probably correct, based on checking
the population figures and a rough count of a dozen or so informal
encampments stretching from the Sudanese border east to the city of
Keren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying it's plausible but it could go up or down''
depending on the fighting, she said. ``We have to constantly assess
and verify the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The estimates include an unknown number of the 330,000 Eritreans
already displaced by the war in the last two years. That in an odd
way has been fortunate, because the World Food Program already had
20,000 tons of wheat in the country that is now feeding a much
larger number of people.
</P>
<P>
   Relief officials say the suffering has also been lessened by the
extraordinary organization of the Eritrean government in getting
people out of the war zones quickly. Tens of thousands of people
were moved by government buses and trucks into camps. Entire
villages have been relocated to the camps, complete with their
local administrators and, sometimes, their shops.
</P>
<P>
   But life is still very hard. Thousands of people who settled
along the Gash River in the west have to contend with infestations
of scorpions and snakes. Hospitals in the evacuated regions are
closed, so there is a shortage of medical care. Relief officials
worry that if people do not leave before the rains, the camps will
be flooded and it will difficult to transport supplies over muddy
and waterlogged roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I would like to live in my house,'' said Habte
Tefere, 80, from a village that was shelled near the Adi Quala.
``But I couldn't. So I had to come here.''

SPREAD OF DISEASE TRACED TO MANY CAUSES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Mass., Netherlands, Ireland, Minn.)  By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Parents who shun vaccines, patients who demand
antibiotics for every sniffle, farmers who use penicillin to fatten
their cows and people who wash with anti-bacterial soaps are all
contributing to the spread of disease and the emergence of
dangerous, drug-resistant germs, researchers said Thursday at a
press briefing on infectious diseases held by the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, infectious disease is the leading cause of death. In
the United States, it is the third-leading cause, after heart
disease and cancer, and deaths from infection increased from 1980
through 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A speaker at the meeting also warned that the health care system
in the United States was not prepared for a bioterrorist attack, in
which hundreds or thousands of people might flood hospitals,
needing treatment for diseases like anthrax, plague or smallpox,
which most doctors in this country have never even seen.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce G. Gellin, executive director of the National Network
for Immunization Information at Vanderbilt University School of
Medicine in Nashville, said unfounded theories ostensibly linking
vaccines to disorders like diabetes and autism were needlessly
alarming parents and making some reluctant to vaccinate their
children.
</P>
<P>
   When a child falls ill shortly after being vaccinated, even
though it is almost certainly a coincidence, it is human nature for
parents to suspect the vaccine, and Gellin acknowledged that their
stories make powerful, frightening anecdotes. But he said there was
no evidence that any vaccine could cause autism or diabetes. Asked
to comment on recent congressional hearings about the possibility,
he said, ``passion overtook science.''
</P>
<P>
   Gellin warned that even a small drop in the vaccination rate
could lead to a resurgence of diseases like measles and whooping
cough, both of which can be severe and even fatal. But young
parents today may not take the threat seriously because they
themselves were vaccinated and have no memory of how severe those
diseases can be. Even chickenpox, which many people consider minor,
leads to 15,000 hospitalizations and 100 deaths a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Declines in the vaccination rate have led to measles epidemics
this year in the Netherlands, with more than 3,000 cases, and in
Dublin, with more than 700. Several deaths have occurred in each
country.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, Dr. Stuart Levy, director of the Center for
Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts University in
Boston, said anti-bacterial soaps and sprays, popular for washing
hands and spritzing kitchen counters, may actually encourage the
growth of ever-hardier, drug-resistant germs.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said consumers should buy only products without
anti-bacterials, and manufacturers should leave out the
anti-bacterials and go back to making plain, old-fashioned soap and
detergent.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said he had made his concerns known to manufacturers. Some
seemed to take him seriously, he said, but others, he suspected,
``wish people like me would just go away.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the problem with anti-bacterials was a simple matter of
``survival of the fittest.'' Rather than killing all bacteria, the
products destroy only the weakest, leaving stronger ones to survive
and multiply. If people acted like surgeons and scrubbed for 10
minutes or left the spray on their kitchen counters for a half
hour, the chemicals might actually kill more germs, he said. But
nobody does that.
</P>
<P>
   His research has shown that bacteria resistant to
anti-bacterials are also resistant to some antibiotics used to
treat infections in people, and so, he said, widespread use of the
products may be contributing to the rise in infections that are
difficult or impossible to treat.
</P>
<P>
   Overuse of antibiotics is also a factor in the development of
resistance, Levy said, citing patients who pressure doctors for
antibiotics that are not needed and farmers who use the drugs as
pesticides on fruit trees and growth promoters in livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Hughes, director of the National Center for Infectious
Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
attributed the rise in death rates from infectious disease partly
to lax monitoring, because of the mistaken belief that such
diseases had been largely wiped out in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes also warned that the world had truly become a global
village, and that the United States must pay more attention to
diseases elsewhere and ``expect the unexpected,'' meaning outbreaks
of illnesses that have not occurred here before. The outbreak of
West Nile encephalitis in the New York area last year was an
example, he said, noting that the disease had previously been
reported only in Europe, Western Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Osterholm, chairman of a private company, Infection
Control Advisory Network, in Eden Prairie, Minn., said terrorists
could easily obtain infectious organisms and the means to grow and
disseminate them. For instance, Osterholm said, crop-dusting
airplanes can be bought over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Osterholm predicted that some sort of germ attack was bound to
occur, but, he said, the United States was not prepared. He said
stockpiles of drugs and vaccines were needed, along with plans and
systems for quickly diagnosing diseases and treating huge numbers
of victims.

   INVESTMENT-FRAUD (Undated) _ Federal and state authorities
announced a combined fight Thursday against a fraudulent fixed-rate
investment that they say bilks thousands of Americans, particularly
older people, out of hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The
scheme involves promissory notes, which are investments that
typically involve a loan to a company in exchange for a fixed
return. Officials estimated that more than 3,000 American investors
were victims of promissory note fraud last year alone. By Jayson

   INVESTMENT-FRAUD (Undated) _ Federal and state authorities
announced a combined fight Thursday against a fraudulent fixed-rate
investment that they say bilks thousands of Americans, particularly
older people, out of hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The
scheme involves promissory notes, which are investments that
typically involve a loan to a company in exchange for a fixed
return. Officials estimated that more than 3,000 American investors
were victims of promissory note fraud last year alone. By Jayson

   TV-SURVIVORS (Undated) _ Last summer, ABC's ``Who Wants to Be A
Millionaire'' turned the television world on its head by defying
every expectation and seizing huge audiences, eventually
catapulting ABC to overall network ratings leadership. Now a new
CBS series, about a group of people forced to live together in
primitive circumstances on an island off Borneo, has had a
similarly stunning start, and television executives are already
wondering whether it can do for CBS what ``Millionaire'' did for
ABC. By Bill Carter.

   AUTO-SALES (Detroit) _ Auto sales dropped 2 percent last month
from May of last year, the first year-over-year drop since summer
1998. Dismal results at DaimlerChrysler and General Motors
accounted for the decline. Other manufacturers posted record sales,
leaving it unclear whether a long-expected sales decline had begun.

   BANKRUPTCY-NORRIS-COLUMN (Undated) _ The market for
million-dollar homes in Florida and Texas has long been stimulated
by the fact that such houses appeal to one particular class of
wealthy people: those who are about to file for bankruptcy. Now
Congress is about to increase the appeal of such homes to rich
people who may not face imminent bankruptcy, but see it as a
possibility if they lose a big lawsuit.

   Veterans.com: A just-launched site, in this Memorial Day week,
dedicated to the men and women who have served in our Armed
Forces. &QL; 
Where: www.veterans.com &QL; 
What's cool: The eyewitness accounts by vets of their experiences
in war and peace are often fascinating. And, unlike listening to
war stories, you can read as much or as little as you like before
clicking onto something else. &QL; 
Features: It's sponsored by the History Channel, a cable TV outlet
that sprinkles in links to its own programming (which is, perhaps
unsurprisingly, heavily oriented toward coverage of great
conflagrations of the past). There's a lot of interesting stuff,
like a veterans' locator service, links to unit reunions around the
country, a resource list, online store, ``Dirty Little Secrets of
the Vietnam War,'' and ``Veteran of the Month.'' The site is less
than a week old, and will need to fill in more to be truly great,
but holds promise as more veterans connect with it and each other. &QL; 
You'll like this if: you've already heard all the old war stories
down at the VFW Hall 3,000 times. &QL;

JUSTICE FOR ALL THE ELIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez is back in the spotlight, thanks to Thursday's
federal appeals court ruling that immigration officials can deny
the boy an asylum hearing. Elian must now remain in the United
States for 14 days to give his Miami relatives a chance to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives should set aside their pain and passion and let
the boy go home with his father as soon as possible. But Elian will
have graced the United States if part of his legacy is to stir
debate on the issue of justice for all children.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Elian saga there has been little public outcry
for the millions of other children caught in comparable battles.
``We have to focus attention on every little kid, to create
permanence in their lives,'' says Shay Bilchik, head of the Child
Welfare League of America.
</P>
<P>
   The league is trying to set a new standard for judging a child's
well-being. Dropping juvenile crime rates, for example, are good,
but a more telling yardstick is the number of children being
victimized by peers, parents, or others. If these numbers also
start falling, then celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Every child's case is different. It is difficult to assess
individual needs, make custody decisions, and support a child
moving from one setting to another.
</P>
<P>
   One useful step was taken two years ago, when Congress passed
the Adoption and Safe Families Act. The bill was meant to save
children from long waits in foster care, requiring shorter stays
and increased adoptions. Still missing, however, are resources to
help parents who risk losing their children. Bilchik estimates that
while 67 percent of parents with children in foster care have
substance-abuse problems, fewer than a third get the services that
could help them kick their addictions _ or reveal that they are
unfit parents.
</P>
<P>
   A bill proposed by Maine's Republican Senator Olympia Snowe
would invest $1.9 billion over five years in substance-abuse
prevention and intervention for needy families identified by child
welfare agencies. The money would give parents a fighting chance to
stabilize their lives and keep their children.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag is high. These children typically don't have
media-savvy relatives who appear on CNN to demand justice from
President Clinton. Current events, however, should remind
legislators that society _ when it wants to _ can go to great
lengths for children.

 &HT;    U.N. peacekeepers rebuilding, Anan says
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Early last month, as United Nations peacekeeping
troops in Sierra Leone were yielding their weapons and vehicles to
the country's rebel soldiers _ and being taken hostage, in some
cases _ observers around the world began to say that U.N.
peacekeeping was breathing its last.
</P>
<P>
   After failed missions in the 1990s in Somalia and Rwanda, surely
the idea of peacekeeping, at least in Africa, was dead. An upcoming
mission in Congo, it seemed, would be aborted for lack of political
will.
</P>
<P>
   But U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in Atlanta for the 11th
annual World Report Conference, said Thursday that the experience
of Sierra Leone carries an entirely different message: The United
Nations has learned from its mistakes and peacekeeping in Africa is
very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope the message that has come out of Sierra Leone is
a very strong one,'' he said. ``In Somalia, we withdrew when we got
into difficulty. In Sierra Leone, the member states are sending in
additional troops _ India, Jordan, Bangladesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than allowing Sierra Leone's rebels to intimidate them,
the U.N. member states have shown resolve, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has also learned, he said, to enter countries
in the future with well-trained, well-armed troops carrying heavier
and more menacing equipment. ``Sometimes you need to show force in
order not to use it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking questions on live TV from an array of international
journalists, Annan argued that it is wrong, when wars erupt, to
blame the people who were trying to keep the peace. That, he said,
tends to absolve the killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to questions of peace and war, the greater part
of the responsibility falls on the leaders and the peoples in the
region,'' said Annan, who is Ghanaian. ``I don't think we in Africa
_ and as an African, I can say this _ can keep fighting each other
and then stand up and ask, `Where is the U.N.? Where is the
international community?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It is time for Africa to accept that it must solve its
differences through political rather than military means, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the United Nations can only be as effective as its
member states make it. With no troops of its own, the United
Nations in essence rents soldiers from willing countries at the
rate of $1,000 per soldier per month. Currently, the United Nations
owes hundreds of millions of dollars to countries that have
contributed peacekeeping troops _ a debt that Annan said can only
be paid if member states pay the body what they owe.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations can be effective when the will is there, the
secretary general said _ as was demonstrated by British
intervention last month in Sierra Leone and by Australian
willingness to lead the mission in East Timor last year.
</P>
<P>
   But when the will is lacking, he said, peacekeepers will arrive
late and be less effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations is your government and mine,'' he said.
``The United Nations is you and me. The United Nations can be as
effective as the governments want it to be.''

AUTO SALES DIP IN MAY, A POSSIBLE EFFECT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Auto sales dropped 2 percent last month from May of
last year, the first year-over-year drop since the summer of 1998.
Dismal results at DaimlerChrysler and General Motors entirely
accounted for the decline as other manufacturers posted record
sales, leaving it unclear whether a long-expected sales decline had
begun.
</P>
<P>
   Only one in five buyers of new family vehicles pays cash; the
rest rely on loans or leases, for which the monthly payments vary
with interest rates. As a result, the auto industry is usually one
of the first to feel the effects when the Federal Reserve starts
pushing up interest rates, as it has done in recent months. Many
economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, have long
watched for weak auto sales as an early indicator that the American
economy might be slowing.
</P>
<P>
   But if auto sales fell because of a slowing economy, many
automakers would be expected to post lower sales figures. Instead,
Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi announced increases in
sales, with Toyota and Mitsubishi reporting their best months ever.
Industry experts suggested this meant that the overall decline in
sales in May was linked at least as much to specific problems at
DaimlerChrysler and GM as to the pace of economic growth in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   While the 2-percent decline in sales last month was the first
since August, 1998, when a strike crippled GM, sales were still
very strong last month by historical standards. Ward's Auto
Infobank, a market data service in Southfield, Mich., calculated
that the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales last month was
17.1 million vehicles. That put last month's sales above the
average pace for last year, the industry's best ever, with 17
million vehicles sold.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's sales plunged 16.8 percent last month after
the company tried to reduce its rebates and other discounts in May.
The company announced on Wednesday that it was increasing its
rebates and eliminating most low-rate auto loans, as part of a new
sales incentives campaign intended to match the more generous
discounts offered by its main rivals, GM and the Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   May of 1999 was also the best month ever for DaimlerChrysler.
``That is a tough benchmark,'' James Holden, the president of
DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   GM's sales fell 5.8 percent, as the world's largest automaker
struggled to stay ahead of Ford in total sales. Paul Ballew, GM's
executive director of market analysis, attributed GM's drop to
shortfalls in three specific segments of the auto market, rather
than an overall weakening of the market in response to the Federal
Reserve's six increases in short-term interest rates or rising gas
prices.
</P>
<P>
   GM's luxury car sales suffered as Cadillac ran short of the new
DeVille sedan, for which GM is still ramping up production after
redesigning the vehicle, Ballew said. The overall pickup truck
market weakened in May, while Korean automakers continued to expand
their share of the small car market, which GM once dominated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can declare May some watershed of industry
moderation'' in the pace of sales, Ballew said in a telephone
conference call with reporters this afternoon, adding that GM still
expected sales to slow somewhat later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Haig Stoddard, the manager of industry analysis at Ward's,
was more concerned about the industry's short-term health. ``We're
definitely heading at least into a stop in the growth we've had,''
he said. ``But June should be a good month because now we've got
all this excess inventory they've got to get rid of.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford's sales crept up 1.4 percent, which still allowed the
company to claim that it had just enjoyed its best May ever.
Toyota's sales inched up 2.7 percent to break a record set last
year. Honda's sales rose 3.6 percent, Nissan's increased 11.5
percent and Mitsubishi's were up 31.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The most recently introduced models sold best, the latest sign
that American shoppers are becoming more conscious of the latest
styles when it comes to cars. William Kirrane, Nissan's vice
president and general manager of Nissan brand cars, said that his
company's Sentra small car and Xterra sport utility vehicle were
the most recently introduced models and had sold especially briskly
even without incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new products have really done well for us,'' Kirrane said.

ALTERNATE SELVES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our ghost selves, the ones that flicker and writhe like wobbly
TV screens, are strewn across the floors and walls of the Museum of
Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   Some whine. Some curse. Some shout, `Hey, you!' at startled
passersby. Some lie flattened and immobilized under chairs and
sofas. Some babble under their electronic ``breath'' in loopy
non-sequiturs, like Hollywood street people or alien abductees,
conversing with the secret voices that haunt their splintered
souls.
</P>
<P>
   Lumped together, these spooky little mannequins with
video-animated faces create an eerie din as you step gingerly
through MOCA's exhibition titled ``Introjection: Tony Oursler
Mid-Career Survey 1976-1999.'' The more you try to tune them out,
the more incessantly they penetrate your consciousness, like a
barking dog on a windless night.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Oursler has been tracking these voices and the mental
states they represent for most of his adult life, since his student
days at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia a
quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout that time, he has explored many different ways of
capturing the rambling look and sound of the human mind in
conscious and unconscious action: in paintings, video performances,
elaborate multi-media installations and, most identifiably, in a
growing series of ``talking'' effigies with videotaped faces and
explosive, passive-aggressive personalities.
</P>
<P>
   These anxious Mini-Me's are surrogates, of course, for humanity.
Like old-fashioned ventriloquist's dummies, they give voice to the
pent-up anxieties of their flesh and blood masters, anxieties that
for Oursler signify the overwhelming impact of a mass-media culture
that suffuses and shapes our very being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Introjection,'' the psychological term in the exhibition's
title, refers to the way our personalities unconsciously absorb the
tics and traits of the people and the world around us. Oursler sees
the modern mind as a big sponge, indiscriminately soaking up
snatches of passing conversations, pop jingles and TV soap opera
plotlines, along with more toxic substances like government lies
and a host of free-floating, Hollywood-induced emotional
pathologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mind is always shifting soundtracks,'' says Oursler,
speaking by phone in friendly, low-key cadences from his New York
City studio. ``You might be listening to a song, thinking about a
conversation you had with a friend of yours, and also trying to
write a grocery list. The human mind is capable of all these
incredible kind of combination of things.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, we are what we watch and hear. And what we watch
and hear these days is as likely to control us as we _ our
channel-zapping illusions of omnipotence notwithstanding _ are
likely to control it.
</P>
<P>
   At 42, Oursler is still, to an extent, creating what he terms
``anti-Hollywood art,'' wedding serious intent with tongue-in-cheek
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that he's against the mediums of film and television,
per se. Rather, Oursler believes mainstream commercial
manifestations, i.e. studio movies and network television, have
barely scratched the surface potential of the moving image and its
narrative forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in my 20s, I felt very much that people missed the
point in terms of representing consciousness in the moving image,''
he says, ``that, in fact, they weren't even close,'' with the
conventional cinematic progression of ``close-up, medium-shot,
long-shot. That was just not it. And I was trying to think about
the way that I thought, personally, what people really did with
their eyes, how people saw, how they shifted between memory and
being present.'''
</P>
<P>
   Practically from the first time he picked up a video camera,
Oursler sensed a new way of accessing the surreal strangeness of
life in the TV age, of taking the ghost out of the boob tube and
the cineplex projector.
</P>
<P>
   If, 100 years ago, the motion picture camera became an instant
stand-in for the outward-looking human eye, Oursler believed
videotape _ fluid, intimate and ever-mutable _ had become a smeary
mirror of our messy internal condition.
</P>
<P>
   He also found that video's origins as an amateurish and
spontaneous form of image-making gave it an interactive quality
lacking in big-budget entertainment beamed to passive audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it (video) was a way of just getting into this space
that I'd been peering into for my entire life, but I had never been
able to imagine any access to,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in upstate Nyack, across the Hudson River from New York
City, Oursler grew up in a Roman Catholic family with long literary
and artistic roots. His paternal grandparents were authors and
screenwriters, a great-aunt taught art, and Oursler's father was a
former Reader's Digest editor.
</P>
<P>
   Attending Cal Arts happened serendipitously. Though he knew
almost nothing at the time about the newly minted arts school,
Oursler found its then-remote physical location to be a boon.
</P>
<P>
   Though there were the usual '70s collegiate distractions _ sex,
drugs, ``a lot of naked-by-the-pool'' _ the atmosphere at Cal Arts
was serious and experimental. The faculty included performance
artist Laurie Anderson and Conceptual art godfather John
Baldessari; composer John Cage was an artist-in-residence.
</P>
<P>
   Though Oursler now lives and works in New York, his years spent
in Los Angeles, the world's entertainment capital, clearly marked
his artistic growth. His work is both a critique of mass-culture
technologies and an attempt to go beyond them by fabricating a new
visual grammar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to understand the existing language,
because I think there's a lot of amazing, evolutionary things
happening, both visually, sonically, and having to do with language
and how they all kind of mix together,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since he first began making art, Oursler's public-access TV
aesthetic has evolved into something slicker, but no less funny or
troubling. Without losing its sense of spontaneous urgency, his
work has exchanged crude cardboard props and low-res imagery in
video installations like ``Son of Oil'' (1982) for sophisticated
multi- channel video, and experiments in newfangled digital
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its cutting-edge immediacy, Oursler's output evinces
his strong interest in, and working knowledge of, the moral and
conceptual issues that have obsessed and bedeviled Western art for
eons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Optics,'' a 1999 mixed-media installation with video
projection, utilizes an old-fashioned camera obscura, miniature
glass devils attached to various light sources (blacklight,
floodlight), and projections of a tiny human figure tumbling
through space to suggest the eternal struggle between light and
dark, good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   The chillingly beautiful installation ``Aperture'' (1998), also
in MOCA's show, arranges small, gray plaster statues (a skull, a
gargoyle, cupids, kissing lovers) in a hypnotic tableau of dead
icons. An LCD video projector, mounted on a tripod, casts the
flickering shape of a scurrying cockroach across this grotesque
``still life,'' symbolically resurrecting its zombified components.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a concoction likely to capture the top Nielsen rating
anytime soon. But it could hearten those who believe visual
techno-culture's best days still lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see (on commercial TV) is what you can expect from
something that has to communicate to like 10 million people at
once,'' Oursler summarizes. ``It has to be something that's fairly,
I wouldn't even say dumbed-down, but it's got to be within a
certain kind of niche. And that's not what art-making is all
about.''

COMMENTARY: A MONTH TO REMEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I tell you, it's good to have May over with.
</P>
<P>
   There was something apocalyptic going on in May, a
post-millennial twitch. The pope spilled the third secret of
Fatima. The National Rifle Association (led by Charlton Heston, the
star of many, many movies about dyspeptic males fending off the end
of the world) announced plans to open a theme restaurant on Times
Square. And that enormous forest fire in New Mexico _ all right, we
have enormous forest fires all the time, but very few set
deliberately by the national government for our own good. (How far,
by the way, is Los Alamos from Roswell?)
</P>
<P>
   Here in New York, Rudy Giuliani mutated into a variation on
Barney the Dinosaur, a fluffy critter who prefers dinner with his
new squeeze to a press conference announcing a big police bust.
We've been a little edgy around him ever since, wondering if he's
actually the same person. ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' pods
may be at work here, or one of those ``X-Files'' aliens who looks
like your best friend, but spouts green acid when he's poked. The
city is disoriented. New York has had fighting mayors and crooked
mayors, and the one before this one was extremely polite. But Love
Mayor sounds so '90s, so _ Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio became the new, post-Giuliani Republican Senate
candidate. Lazio, a Republican congressman from Long Island,
appeared to have popped out of the ground from nowhere, but
actually he's been dying for the nomination all along, and spent
most of the spring desperately waving his arms in crowd scenes,
looking available. The split lip he collected when he took a header
during a Memorial Day parade worked well for him, being as close as
a young 21st-century politician can come to a war wound. Besides,
it gave the Republican convention this week something to talk about
besides Lazio's two great thundering qualifications:
</P>
<P>
   A) From here.
</P>
<P>
   B) Not unhinged.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback is Lazio's strong resemblance to those unnamed
``Star Trek'' crewmen who get included on every expedition so the
mutants will have somebody to incinerate. And there was something a
little eerie, not to say unappetizing, about his promise to the
people of Buffalo that he would ``be here so often I'm going to be
sweating Buffalo wings.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those of us who spent our formative years in pre-Vatican
II parochial schools, the story of the month was still the Lady of
Fatima letter. For kids who went to school on split shifts in
trailers, we spent a lot of valuable class time speculating about
the exact nature of the secret the Blessed Virgin was supposed to
have passed on to the pope via a trio of Portuguese shepherd
children in 1917. Most people believed it simply revealed the date
of the end of the world. In my particular neighborhood, the word
was out that Pope Pius XII had opened the letter, burst into tears
and cried ``Oh Canada, poor Canada.'' We found this somewhat
comforting, since we were in Ohio at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it was hard to escape the evidence that the final
days were upon us, what with the air raid drills, the bomb shelters
and a set of nuns who could always come up with a prophecy that
made it seem extremely unlikely that anybody was going to be around
for summer vacation. Our parents had moved to the suburbs so we
could grow up in perfect safety, then sent us off to schools where
the faculty assured us we were doomed. It was a rich culture,
actually, and we probably have it to thank for the fact that these
days, on television and in the movies, any character who moves into
a gated community with a good security system is guaranteed to get
eaten by werewolves.
</P>
<P>
   The actual secret of Fatima had to be a letdown for those who
were expecting a timetable for Armageddon. The Vatican says the
letter revealed the assassination attempt on the pope in 1981,
although it seems to be couched in that really flexible,
one-size-fits-all prose used by all truly successful
future-forecasters. We appear to have gone through a lot of angst
for nothing but the fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm ready for a stretch of utter predictability.
That's why it was so reassuring on Wednesday night when the only
woman over 35 on the ``Survivor'' series was the first person to
get thrown off the island.

&HT;     HINDU FINDS GRADUATION PRAYER OFFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDs: SUBS 6thgraf, ``It was, to add Salinas' age; pickup:
``About)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By J. MICHAEL PARKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Gracious heavenly Father,'' ``in your name'' and ``amen'' _
expressions taken for granted among Christians at prayer _
sometimes seem grating to non-Christians when uttered at public
events.
</P>
<P>
   Those words angered a group of Hindu families attending a
graduation ceremony at a San Antonio high school last weekend,
although the school's principal is satisfied the prayers fit legal
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime this month, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to
clarify when and how prayer may be included in public school
events, when it announces a decision in a case challenging
student-led prayer at high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruled against such prayers in a case
originating in the Santa Fe School District in Galveston County,
Texas, but differentiated between games and graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, Alex Salinas, who attended Madison High School's
commencement last Saturday, said the invocation and benediction
clearly were sectarian and insensitive to non-Christians in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Christian denominational prayer rather than a generic
prayer,'' said Salinas, 49, who said he has been a practicing Hindu
since he was 19. His daughter, Anandi Leela Deveki Salinas, was
among the graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 10-to-12 Hindu families went out to eat at an Indian
restaurant Saturday after the Madison graduation ceremony, and
everybody was talking about it,'' Salinas said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hadn't thought much about it during the invocation,
but when similar wording was repeated in the benediction at the end
of the ceremony, he found it offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no warning that it was a Christian prayer. We were
all required to stand and participate. It was very offensive,
especially because there have been many Hindu temples burned by
Christians in various parts of the world,'' Salinas said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed the offense was unintentional but could
reflect a subtle influence by Christian conservatives on school
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for blood. I'm just looking for an admission
by school officials that what they did was wrong,'' Salinas said.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Principal Bobby Smith said the prayers were written and
delivered by students. He said he had read both of them and
believed they were appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can appreciate Mr. Salinas' convictions, and I respect them
wholeheartedly. We're not in the business of imposing religion on
anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he apologized privately to Salinas, but Salinas said
he wanted a public apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't feel like we did anything wrong, but I
apologized to him and his family for any feeling they have that we
offended them,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   However the Supreme Court rules in the Santa Fe case, Smith said
he would abide by it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A ruling by the high court could help set clearer boundaries for
when prayers are appropriate, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 Texas case, Jones vs. Clear Creek School District, a
federal appeals court found public school graduation prayers
constitutional if they are ``nonsectarian'' and
``nonproselytizing.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans on Tuesday, a panel of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court
of Appeals dismissed a lawsuit against the Aledo (Texas) School
District on allegations it infringed on her right to present a
prayer. Katherine Hackleman Furley sued the district in May after a
school district attorney deleted parts of a prayer she had written
for graduation day.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Boston, assistant director of communications for Americans
United for Separation of Church and State, said he expects the high
court's decision to clear up confusion over prayers at graduation
ceremonies and other school-sponsored gatherings, not just athletic
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clear Creek decision was nonsensical. As a practical
matter, there's no such thing as a nonsectarian prayer. Hinduism is
a polytheistic religion, so to a Hindu, any prayer to one God is
sectarian,'' Boston said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rao Pemmeraju, a former president of the Hindu Temple of San
Antonio, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Hindu faith, there is only one God, but God can have
many manifestations and many names. We believe we're all children
of God, and we don't believe Hinduism is the only way to salvation.
God is in you and me and everyone,'' Pemmeraju said.
</P>
<P>
   He said most Hindus wouldn't have been offended by the Madison
student's prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Many have tried to water down prayers in an effort to find an
inoffensive compromise, but there is no such thing, Boston said.
</P>
<P>
   His own group has suggested those who want a religious component
to graduation ceremonies could organize a private baccalaureate
ceremony at a church.

rules _ on the second day of a 10-day auction, long before
speculation that the painting might be by the renowned painter

PAT, PREDICTABLE `HARLAN'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below; `tonight' refers to Sun., June 4) 
Our rating: 2 stars. 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Harlan County War'' is an earnest civics lesson with a moment
or two of drama. Holly Hunter stars as Ruby, the wife of an
impoverished Kentucky mineworker (the film is set in the '70s) who
becomes an impassioned voice for a beleaguered union trying to get
a toehold against the monolithic company that exploits its ravaged
employees.
</P>
<P>
   While Warren (Stellan Skarsgard), the putative union
representative, broods and smokes, Ruby comes up with all the ideas
most effective in battling the mine operators. Warren doesn't even
cogently explain to the cracker mineworkers why the schemes will
sway public empathy, which forces Ruby's husband, Silas (Ted
Levine), into unmotivated bouts of moodiness in which he turns
against his forward-thinking wife.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter nails the regional accent to such an extent that you
might be hard-pressed to understand what she's saying a lot of the
time. Her stature as an Oscar-winning leading lady works against
her here, as her turn becomes all about her accent and mannerisms
and looking just a smidgen more glamorous than the hardscrabble
folks surrounding her _ it's not quite as bad as Jodie Foster in
``Nell,'' but it's close.
</P>
<P>
   Such black-and-white issue development (owners &QC;
</P>
<P>
   bad; workers &QC;
</P>
<P>
   good) may in fact be historically accurate, but it doesn't help
the movie's dramatic thrust. When gunplay finally figures in, it
feels like a bald attempt to rouse viewers from their stupor.
Documentarian Barbara Koppel's Oscar winner ``Harlan County,
U.S.A.,'' which inspired this telefilm, essayed this struggle far
more compellingly and convincingly. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
The show: ``Harlan County War.'' &QL; 
What: Drama about the unionization of a Kentucky coal mine. &QL; 
The stars: Holly Hunter, Stellan Skarsgard, Ted Levine. &QL;

<P>
   VOLOGDA, Russia _ Don't look now, says Viktor Petukhov, but that
Russian economy the world wrote off as a basket case two years ago
is roaring back to life.
</P>
<P>
   He is certainly right about the roaring part.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a peeling salmon-colored stucco building near the center
of this otherwise quiet town, Petukhov, the director of the Vologda
Textile Enterprise, stood one recent day and surveyed the
ear-splitting success he has wrought. Around him, 100 mechanical
looms clack-clacked in deafening unison, spitting miles of linen
onto spools as big as car axles.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead, hissing water jets spewed a dust-eating mist that hung
through the vast room like cigar smoke in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has to be clean! There are cleaning ladies all
around!'' Petukhov shouted. ``If there is any dirt, it will affect
the quality of the product!''
</P>
<P>
   Later, over Turkish coffee in his office, he said linen sales
leapt by 50 percent last year and would grow another third or so
this year. And this from a firm that was bankrupt and rudderless
just four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's growth everywhere,'' he said. ``All we need now is
stability and some government understanding of the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Russia's not-quite-open secret: the crash of 1998, the
meltdown that wiped out Russia's middle class and turned the
Kremlin into a global deadbeat, is over.
</P>
<P>
   Its devastating aftereffects _ a sharply devalued ruble; the
disappearance of imported goods; a government cut off from
addictive foreign loans _ turned out to be fuel for an economy that
had simply run out of gas. A landscape littered with bankruptcies
two years ago now sprouts hundreds of Vologda Textiles.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether that comeback is real and gaining
strength, or will run out of steam.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin casts it as real, if shaky, and the numbers look
promising. Industrial production through April was 10.3 percent
greater than in the same period of 1999. Russian exports jumped 50
percent. The average worker's salary _ a meager $73 per month _
nevertheless was up 7 percent in March over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Companies and the government have begun to pay workers the
months and even years of back wages they are owed. Inflation this
year is expected to be a third of the 1999 rate. Investment in new
equipment and buildings is rising for the first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Most promising, Russia's budget now runs a primary surplus _
that is, it has money left after domestic spending to pay some of
its foreign debt. In Washington in May, President Vladimir Putin's
chief economic adviser told President Clinton that the Kremlin no
longer needs to secure new foreign loans just to pay its old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Putin now announces the good news personally, as in April when
he disclosed a higher-than-expected increase in economic growth in
the first quarter. ``By our Russian standards of recent times,'' he
boasted, ``this is not just stable and good. This is enormous
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautions, and experts agree, that it cannot last absent basic
economic reforms. He already has proposed wholesale changes in
taxes, including a flat income tax and corporate tax cuts. He
promises to announce equally sweeping changes in June. If they
become law, his advisers say, Russia's economy should grow by
roughly 5 percent a year _ and inflation should fall steadily _ as
far as the eye can see.
</P>
<P>
   But other top government forecasters are less cocksure. They
agree that Russia's economy is reaping the economic windfall of the
1998 crisis. The problem, they say, is that the windfall has now
been more or less exploited _ and there is little to take its
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second part of this year, the positive influences will
mostly be over,'' said Alexander Frenkel, the chief macroeconomics
forecaster at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Economics Institute.
``And the influence of negative factors _ low investment; a foreign
payments crisis; a low standard of living _ may significantly
influence economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Eduard F. Baranov, the first deputy chief of the government's
Economic Research Center, says Russia's boomlet has been confined
mostly to raw-materials exports and light industries like
food-processing and textiles. Major industries have mostly been
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's Vologda Textiles, he said, ``are like little plants
that give us hope. The more we have, the better our chances.'' But
they are not the architects of basic reform that the economy needs.
``We still have the mentality of the old Soviet plan, when we
didn't have to think about sales or quality or lowering expenses,''
he said. ``We have to rebuild our organization at the molecular
level. And it's going to take a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the bears say, the glowing statistics look a lot
different when Russia's performance is compared to the months
before the August 1998 crash instead of the depressed months after
it. Investment so far this year is surely greater than last, they
allow. But it still is only 92 percent of what was registered
during the earlier part of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Workers' real income is substantially higher than a year ago.
But it remains barely 77 percent of what it was in 1998, and that
translates into a lower standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wages haven't returned yet to their pre-crisis level,''
Baranov said. ``And while salaries have increased, they have risen
at a lower rate than prices.''
</P>
<P>
   A Russia that poor is hard put to generate enough domestic
demand to make the economy grow. The statistics bear that out,
Frenkel says: exports are driving the recovery, accounting for more
than $8 of every $10 of growth in the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Russian exports have boomed because the fallen ruble has made
them exceptionally cheap. But most are raw materials like timber,
chemicals and especially high-priced oil that are going to a world
whose appetite for commodities is increasingly sated.
</P>
<P>
   Exporting consumer goods is a non-starter; most remain too
shoddy or poorly marketed to sell abroad. Some of those same goods
have prospered at home because of another crisis-borne opportunity:
the chance to fill the gaps created on store shelves after the
ruble's crash made foreign products too expensive for most people.
</P>
<P>
   But those gaps have been largely closed. To keep growing,
companies now must attract new buyers _ no easy task in a nation
whose products are not ready for export and whose citizens are too
poor to buy anyway. In fact, exports have slowed this year, and
industrial output fell in April. So did the measure of business
managers' confidence in the future.
</P>
<P>
   All that seems at odds with the brimming orders at Vologda
Textile and its kin. But in more than a few ways, Vologda Textile
epitomizes the economy's two-steps-forward, one-back quality. Like
the rest of Russia, this place has come a long way in the last few
years, yet it still has miles to go.

<P>
   The more meticulously Al Gore articulates his message, the
better he scores with voters on issues high on their agenda _
health care, education and Social Security _ but the less they like
him. Why do so many voters wish they could take the Al Gore out of
Al Gore's positions?
</P>
<P>
   He tries too hard to be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Perfection is a serious flaw for a modern politician. Gore has
suffered from it all his life. In his senior yearbook, his prep
school classmates at St. Albans called him ``frighteningly good at
many things,'' but his habitual perfectionism didn't make people
like him; rather, it provoked the meanspiritedness of envy. Behind
his back some classmates called him ``Ozymandias,'' after the king
in the Shelley poem who cries, ``Look on my works, ye mighty, and
despair!''
</P>
<P>
   The ur-attribute of a successful politician is charm. People
look first for a candidate they like, and it is easier to like a
candidate who needs to be loved _ who can't wait to get to the next
fund-raiser and who sticks around, like President Clinton, until
chairs are being upturned on the banquet tables, until every pair
of eyes has been looked into as if at a new best friend.
</P>
<P>
   But Al Gore doesn't need to be loved. He needs to be right.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he a polymath who makes the rest of us feel like
slackers; he lacks glaring flaws: no dark past, no drunken parent
or dubious paternity, no private demons, no cheating at Harvard, no
bad-boy brother or left-wing wife; alas, not even a Gennifer. How
is the poor man to compete in the Politics of Personal Biography!
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's goody-goodiness deprives him of the messy
imperfections that allow voters to get past their envy of the
famous and powerful. Unlike Clinton, who stole the show at a recent
fund-raiser by mocking his own aging in office _ ``I was always the
youngest person who did everything. Now ... I'm just kind of an
old, gray-haired redneck'' _ the vice president has scarcely aged
in his seven White House years. No love handles or shoe-polish hair
color.
</P>
<P>
   He is fanatic about preserving a near-perfect physique. On the
day in 1976 when he learned a congressional seat was unexpectedly
coming vacant, Gore immediately dropped to the floor and started
doing push-ups. Today he does crunches on Air Force Two. His
perfect abs are a silent rebuke to all those boomer men who have
graduated beyond size 36 belts.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is ridiculed for his slow, deliberate speaking style.
Why does he plait each sentence as if he were teaching macrame to
kindergartners? Does he have to enunciate every consonant? Must he
use Tidewater Gentleman grammar at truck stops?
</P>
<P>
   Probably, yes. There is a plausible reason that Al Gore speaks
the way he does. Unlike George W., he does not have patrician
roots. His father was born in a place called Possum Hollow, in a
home without running water or electricity, surrounded by folks who
spoke Tennessee hillbilly. Albert Gore Sr. had to commute to
Nashville to take night classes in law. He disciplined himself to
speak with formal precision, and he raised his boy to be a more
perfect version of himself, sending him to St. Albans for polish.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Senator Gore Sr. boasted to me: ``Al's grammar is as
near perfect in extemporaneous speeches as you can come by. You can
just see the commas falling in.''
</P>
<P>
   The American public does not easily forgive overt
intellectualism. And while he wasn't a spectacular student, Al Gore
likes nothing better than immersing himself in a complex subject
like arms control or global warming. You can just see his neurons
branching.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gets away with being brainy by sounding folksy and never
making voters feel stupid. George W. Bush doesn't try to improve on
his father's malapropisms, doesn't read books _ and is proud of
being nonintellectual. But he gets his ideas across as fast as
Instant Messaging, and in a caffeine-high, dumbed-down America
that's what counts.
</P>
<P>
   Another intangible Gore trait was described by a voter in a
recent New York Times/CNN poll. ``Al Gore acts as if he's not sure
what he's thinking, as if he doesn't have a mind of his own,'' said
Vera Jeane, a nurse from Bay City, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Doing what is wanted has made Al Gore a dream vice president.
When he found out what Clinton wanted him to do to get them
re-elected, he shook the tambourine from the White House to a
Buddhist temple. It took him months to find the words to separate
himself from his boss' personal dishonor. And when he finally did
strike a position starkly different from Clinton's, on Elian
Gonzalez, he read the country's wishes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The more advisers and polls he consults, the less able Al Gore
is to listen to his own convictions. Whether he is scared of losing
and failing to live up to his father's dream, or scared of winning
because the dream is not his own, Al Gore does not convey
confidence or passion as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Won't somebody tell him he doesn't have to be Ozymandias?
Americans don't want a king, but they might like an authentic Al
Gore.

<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez is another step closer to taking his son
Elian home to Cuba, thanks to Thursday's 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruling, and Americans who have been caught up in the drama
of a divided family may be feeling happy for him. But for those of
us who try to help refugees fleeing from oppression and
mistreatment in their home countries, this case is not so easy to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   There was, indeed, a victory for refugee children: the judges
unambiguously affirmed that children have the right to apply for
asylum in the United States. That is enormously significant, since
as Elian's case dramatically illustrates, not every child who lands
on our shores arrives with an intact nuclear family able to speak
for him in unison. The lower court ruling, which held that U.S. law
was silent about the right of children to apply for asylum, had
threatened to undermine the important principle that children, even
on their own, have a right to ask for refuge here.
</P>
<P>
   But what good is that legal right if the rules by which it must
be exercised restrict it out of existence? This is where Thursday's
appeals court decision went down the same wrong path as the lower
court, chiefly by putting too much faith in the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The judges declined to intervene in the workings of the INS _
ceding its right under separation of powers to carry out
immigration law _ even though much of the decision is devoted to
outlining ways in which the INS policy ``worries'' the court: Elian
was not interviewed, and no consideration was given to the regime
under which he would live in Cuba, or to his father's belated
appearance in the United States to retrieve his son.
</P>
<P>
   The result in this case may or may not be right, but clearly
there will be other cases where the lack of fair procedures will
harm children with genuine asylum claims.
</P>
<P>
   What about a teen-age West African girl fleeing her father's
command that she be genitally mutilated? What about a 17-year-old
boy who might be killed at home for wishing to marry out of his
faith?
</P>
<P>
   Will courts in the future, looking to this case as a precedent,
leave it to the INS to decide whether to accept their applications,
if their parents object?
</P>
<P>
   The court made clear Thursday that children have a right to
apply for asylum; it failed to ensure that the INS procedures for
exercising that right will be fair.

 VOLOGDA, Russia: to go.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 38 years after its founding in 1953, Vologda Textile was a
worry-free place. Its 5,000 workers had state-guaranteed jobs. The
bottom line was no concern: the state bought the output, too. In
its heyday, the factory churned out 22 million square meters of
linen _ 8.5 square miles _ a year.
</P>
<P>
   But when communism ended in 1991, Vologda Textile followed the
rest of Russian industry into a black hole. The government hastily
privatized the company. Among the harebrained schemes its new
managers chased was a switch from making textiles to making jeeps.
By the mid-'90s, the company was bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Vologda's regional government finally intervened, and in 1998 it
dispatched Petukhov, a dour furniture-factory manager with an
all-business attitude, to clean up the mess. A mess it was, too.
Workers had gone unpaid for three years. With a crippled factory as
the buyer for their product, farmers had stopped growing flax, and
cultivation had plummeted from 200,000 acres in the early '90s to a
paltry 6,000 acres in 1998. Exports were a fantasy: the ancient
looms produced linen that was only 100-centimeters wide for a world
market that only bought cloth 150 centimeters wide.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Vologda Textile had some advantages. For one, Russia
was posed to prosper in the world textile business, if it could
only control costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, the textile industry is shutting down,'' Petukhov
said. ``Labor costs are very expensive in Europe, and fabrics
produced in Europe are very expensive. Since we're all in a single
economy now, the centers of textile production have been moving
east to Russia, Ukraine and other places.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the region's government was already pushing the sorts of
economic reforms that Putin is pressing on the federal parliament.
The region's new governor, Vyacheslav Y. Pozgalev, exempted
businesses from all taxes provided that they poured the savings
back into their companies. He loaned money to flax farmers and
equipment to see them through the fiscal dry spell between planting
and harvest. And he gave Vologda Textile a break on electricity
prices and a hefty order of linen to get it back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that clothing is one of life's essentials. ``When
people's income fell after the crash, lots of them became poor,''
Frankel observed. ``And when you're poor, all you can afford is
food and clothes.'' The crash of '98 solved Vologda Textile's
competitiveness woes: almost overnight, the ruble's plunge made its
linen four times cheaper to foreign buyers. Ordinary Russians
bought, too, because they had to. Nationally, textile production
shot up 20 percent in 1999, even as other industries struggled
after the fiscal collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that might have helped had the factory not
bootstrapped itself into profitability. The management slashed the
workforce to 1,300, ending the featherbedding that was a staple of
Soviet factory life. The government shut the monolithic trade
agency that marketed textiles abroad, so Petukhov began hawking his
wares, and building relationships, at trade shows in Milan, Paris
and New York.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As in most Russian industry, new equipment was too expensive. So
over a year, workers rebuilt 400 looms to produce 150-centimeter
fabric and fired up a foundry to make hard-to-get spare parts.
</P>
<P>
   Linen-making is bewilderingly complex, entailing 80 operations
from flax to cloth, and plates on the big looms and thread-making
machines reveal service dates stretching back as far as the 1970s.
That is consistent with the rest of Russia, where machinery is on
the average over 16 years old, twice what it was in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As the result of all the changes Vologda Textile will sell 6
million meters of linen this year _ well below historic totals, but
enough to make a profit. Next year, the goal is 8 million meters.
</P>
<P>
   Exports have rocketed to 80 percent of sales, with Italy and the
United States the primary customers. Petukhov also has paid off
back wages. That helped workers, who make between 31 cents and 46
cents an hour, or $50 to $70 a month, for mind-numbing and
unhealthy work. ``American workers would never work for such
wages,'' Petukhov grumbled.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the assembly line, 37-year-old Tatyana Naidyonova, an apron
covering her Harley-Davidson tee-shirt, paused from cleaning a
machine with kerosene and agreed. ``It's not much money,'' she
said. ``But where else can you get any more?'' Raises will have to
wait until the plant can sell more and better linen.
</P>
<P>
   For that, Petukhov is eyeing a new production line for batik,
and a bleaching line that will accept 150-centimeter linen without
bunching it up and causing streaks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pozgalev, the governor, says private investors, this time with
experience, could buy the factory by year's end. His eventual goal,
and Petukhov's, is to move from a supplier of basic cloth to a
producer of more profitable dyed and refined fabrics _ and
eventually to make and export clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only to solve the problem of the quality of our
material and little by little increase the volume,'' Petukhov said.
``What's needed is that in Russia we produce as much as possible,
and buy as little as possible abroad.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That is a long way away. The factory still faces basic problems
and Soviet mindsets at every turn. One example: linen production is
severely crimped by the supply of local flax, which is in turn
limited by the state's utter failure to replace Soviet-style
collective farming and put in place sound management. So Vologda
Textile has been forced to buy higher-priced flax from Belgium,
France and the Netherlands, which is slapped with a 15 percent
customs duty. That raises Vologda Textile's costs, and lowers
sales.
</P>
<P>
   The factory also has to navigate the Gordian customs office,
which inexplicably follows the factory's processing of imported
flax into cloth even after the duty is paid and the reedy plant is
made into thread.
</P>
<P>
   The factory is peppered with tags on various machines reserving
them exclusively for imported flax under customs supervision. Asked
why, Petukhov said dryly: ``We have a bureaucracy in this country.
You probably have one in America, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem of using imported flax may be solved soon; local
flax production should jump by two-thirds, to 25,000 acres, next
year.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Vologda Textile must import some 40 percent of
its raw material from Europe. That lifts costs. But Petukhov savors
the irony. ``For once,'' he says, ``we're importing our raw
materials from the West, instead of the other way around.'' &QL;

AUTHORITIES TARGET PROMISSORY NOTE SCAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ariz., Fla., Calif., Mich.)   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal and state authorities announced a combined fight
Thursday against a fraudulent fixed-rate investment that they say
bilks thousands of Americans, particularly older investors, out of
hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   The schemes involve promissory notes, which are investments that
typically involve a loan to a company in exchange for a fixed
return. Officials estimated that more than 3,000 American investors
were victims of promissory note schemes last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and 28 attorneys general
said they planned to dedicate more resources to the investigation
and prosecution of these cases. So far, the cases have garnered
little attention and have been hampered by the difficulty of
proving that many participants were knowingly involved in the
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These promissory note scams have cost investors tens of
millions of dollars,'' said Brad Skolnik, the president of the
North American Association of Securities Administrators, an
investors' group, and the Indiana securities commissioner. Working
together, the states and the SEC can leverage their resources to
prevent the perpetrators of the schemes from eluding regulators by
moving from state to state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC announced that it had recently filed 13 enforcement
actions against 38 individuals and 22 companies accused of
defrauding investors of more than $300 million. State regulators
have also filed a spate of cases in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some business leaders have quietly objected to the initiative,
reported Thursday in USA Today, because they fear it may scare
people away from legitimate promissory note investments.
</P>
<P>
   In most promissory note schemes, bogus companies enlist
insurance agents or brokers, who sometimes don't know they are
taking part in a fraudulent scheme, to persuade clients to make
large investments that guarantee high returns, law enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The investors are generally given notes that insure the returns
through offshore insurance companies. But in most cases the issuers
have no insurance, collateral or other ways to guarantee payment.
The swindlers often focus on the affluent and elderly, which has
led to a high number of cases in states like California, Florida,
New York and Arizona, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain demographic that people go after, and older
Americans are often more trusting,'' said Myles Edwards, senior
adviser for industry compliance and enforcement matters at the
North American Association of Securities Administrators,
``especially when it is someone they have dealt with before, like
an insurance agent. And the problem is growing.''
</P>
<P>
   The particularly insidious element of the promissory note
schemes, the authorities say, is that the elderly are often singled
out by people with whom they have done business in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent example, regulators in Michigan brought charges
earlier this year against the IRM Corp., accusing it of bilking
2,435 people of more than $82 million through fraudulent promissory
note investments in real estate and limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, prosecutors working for Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer filed a civil suit Thursday in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan against two insurance agents in Kingston, N.Y., Frank
Fucilo, 68, and Tiber Tomshaw, 52.
</P>
<P>
   The suit accuses them of swindling 69 New Yorkers, most of them
elderly, out of more than $3.8 million in a promissory note scheme
that included making investments in petroleum, entertainment,
technology and transportation companies. Fucilo's lawyer declined
to comment, and Tomshaw's lawyer did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   James McNerlin, 68, a retired Kingston businessman, said he lost
$103,000 after Fucilo, who had helped him with his retirement
account and other investments, persuaded him to invest in the Red
Bank Petroleum Co., of Dallas. The company went bankrupt, and the
insurance that backed the promissory notes proved not to exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never expect this to happen to anyone, especially when you
have dealt with the person before and he gives you a promissory
note that says you can't lose anything,'' McNerlin said Thursday.
``You really feel embarrassed. Who wants to say that you lost
$300,000 at the click of a finger? I am not the only one; there are
a lot of people getting scammed like this.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Spitzer called the case an example of ``the worst
kind of scam'' that ``preyed on people who had placed their trust
in them through their insurance dealings.'' Spitzer pledged to
increase efforts to go after such criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The New York case highlights some of the difficulties that law
enforcement officials have had in prosecuting promissory note
schemes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomshaw and Fucilo, are both longtime insurance agents in
Kingston, which is about 80 miles north of New York City. They
offered clients a chance to invest in several start-up companies
and claimed a ``risk-free, guaranteed return of 10.5 percent'' on
their money within nine months, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the victims cashed out life insurance policies,
retirement savings and college education funds for their children,
which all offered much lower returns. Fucilo and Tomshaw collected
commissions totaling $366,000 from Saferate Financial Services
Inc., the California company that enlisted the two men, according
to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say they have so far been unable to bring criminal
charges against Fucilo and Tomshaw because of the difficulty in
proving the two men knew about the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to prove that they knew what they were doing was a
basic scheme to defraud,'' one official said. ``We have to prove
that they knew that everything they said was untrue, that the
investment was bad and that the money was not really insured.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the same reasons make it difficult for the
attorney general's office to file criminal charges against Saferate
or any of the other companies involved.
</P>
<P>
   In the civil suit, Fucilo and Tomshaw are both accused of fraud,
failure to register as brokers and making unsuitable investment
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said he would like to recover the $366,000 that Tomshaw
and Fucilo received, as well as the rest of the money that went to
Saferate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work vigorously to trace the proceeds and recover
some of the millions of dollars that were lost,'' Spitzer said.
``We want to stop people from preying on people whom they have
developed a relationship of trust with.''

 &HT;    AOL's Case looks forward to merger
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ America Online Chairman Steve Case said a recently
announced management shuffle following AOL's pending merger with
Time Warner will allow him to work with one of his ``heroes,'' Ted
Turner, to map the media giant's future.
</P>
<P>
   Both Case and Turner, Time Warner's vice chairman and currently
head of its Turner cable TV empire, took pains Thursday to counter
news reports that Turner was unhappy with the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Case said he and Turner will be ``joined at the hip'' and will
be responsible for exploring future technological and business
opportunities after the merger, which will combine businesses
ranging from the Atlanta Hawks to CNN to Time magazine to AOL's
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted and I will be freed to think strategically about where the
next opportunities will be,'' he said Thursday at the a luncheon
speech before hundreds of CNN correspondents and other guests at
its annual CNN World Report Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, Ted has been one of my heroes,'' he said,
adding that he was ``enthralled'' when he heard Turner speak in the
late 1970s. He said Turner's tenacity in launching the
around-the-clock CNN news channel inspired him during his own
efforts to keep AOL going.
</P>
<P>
   But recent news reports have said Turner complained about a
reorganization plan announced last month in which Turner will no
longer head the Time Warner division that includes CNN and other
units he brought into the company in a 1995 merger.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin and AOL
President Robert Pittman said Turner, who will remain vice
chairman, will have a bigger role in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The merger goes to a shareholder vote of both companies on June
23, but must also win approval from government regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Turner told journalists after the luncheon that he was ``happy
as a clam.''
</P>
<P>
   He batted aside questions about his role in the company and his
plans after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't even merged yet. It's business as usual. But
obviously, I'm happy. I'm happy as a clam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his daily routine won't change much. ``I'm going to have
my bowl of Wheaties every morning,'' he joked before ducking into a
men's room, with several journalists following.
</P>
<P>
   ``And guess what?'' he added a few minutes later. ``I'm even
happier now.''

roughly triple the size of Tokyo itself. Lavish clubhouses included
expensive artwork from masters like Chagall and Monet and solid
gold fixtures. Bankers and promoters were financing memberships _
for up to $200,000 each _ as investments that they predicted would
take off like a well-hit tee shot. But the golf club investment
craze ran into trouble when Japan's economic bubble burst 10 years
ago. Now, at least 1,700 of the country's golf courses are bankrupt
or in financial trouble. And the lenders who financed the courses
and the individual memberships are desperately trying to contain
one of the the economy's biggest problems. By Howard W. French.

 &HT;    Roundup of TV hightlights for the week

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News ServiceFriday
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  New York Yankees at Atlanta Braves (7:35 p.m. on TBS) _ The
first of a three-game interleague series is a rematch of last
October's World Series.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Twenty Years of Stories: This is CNN'' (9 p.m. on CNN) _
Larry King hosts part two of the news network's retrospective,
which covers the second decade. Of course, with the Yankees-Braves
game airing opposite, this isn't exactly going to bang the Nielsen
gong here in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Saved By the Bell'' (10 a.m. on NBC) _ I believe it was
Homer Simpson who once said, ``Oh, that Screech! He cracks me up!''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Passport to Paris'' (8 p.m. on the Family Channel) _
Whatever happened to the Olsen twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley,
formerly of ``Full House''? They're on the Family Channel in a new
movie, headed to Paris, and getting boyfriends. Obviously, the
apocalypse draws nigh.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Harlan County War'' (8 p.m. on Showtime) _ Conyers' own
Holly Hunter stars in this new movie, based on the same true events
covered in the 1976 documentary ``Harlan County U.S.A.'' With a
rural Kentucky accent that's almost impenetrable at times, Hunter
plays the wife of a coal miner who gets involved in unionizing the
mines.
</P>
<P>
   Movies
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Singin' in the Rain' (10 p.m. Friday on Turner Classic
Movies) _ Movie about one actress (Debbie Reynolds) who dubs her
voice for another (Jean Hagen). And of course, there's Gene Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``My Fair Lady'' (Noon Sunday on American Movie Classics) _
Movie in which one singer (Marni Nixon) dubbed her voice for
another (Audrey Hepburn). And of course, there's Rex Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   Best Bet
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Tony Awards'' (9 p.m. Sunday on CBS)
</P>
<P>
   Of the traditional big four TV awards shows (Oscar, Emmy,
Grammy, Tony), the Tonys generally have the best production
numbers, and why shouldn't they? While the others usually throw
together kitsch and rehearse a couple of times, the Tonys, honoring
Broadway theater, use the best production numbers from the best
shows, performed by the pros who do it eight times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, as usual, the hot competition is in the musical revival
category, where ``The Music Man'' (represented by ``76
Trombones''), ``Kiss Me Kate'' (``Too Darn Hot'') and ``Jesus
Christ Superstar'' (``Superstar,'' ``Gethsemane'') are competing.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell returns as host, and presenters (all of whom
have done at least some theater work in their careers) include
Kathie Lee Gifford, Kelsey Grammer, Bernadette Peters, Carol
Burnett, Nathan Lane and Susan Lucci.
</P>
<P>
   And if you want a total Tony wallow, WGTV airs an hour of lesser
awards from 8-9 p.m. before CBS takes over.
</P>
<P>
   Second-Best Bet
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sex and the City'' (9 p.m. Sunday on HBO)
</P>
<P>
   The four single women whose lives are chronicled in HBO's series
``Sex and the City'' are as shallow as a stack of Waffle House hash
browns. And yet they remain perversely fascinating (as well as
fascinatingly perverse).
</P>
<P>
   It could be the great clothes they're always wearing. It could
be the great bedroom romps they're always having. But mostly, it's
the writing. Without writers providing them with bons mots (i.e.,
if they were real), these gals would hardly be worth the bother of
ignoring.
</P>
<P>
   Back for a third season of 18 episodes starting Sunday, ``S&AMP;C''
stars Sarah Jessica Parker as sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw, and
her three friends: sleep-around Samantha (Kim Cattrall), cynic
Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and idealist Charlotte (Kristin Davis).
</P>
<P>
   In the first two episodes, Carrie is wooed and won by an older
politican who turns out to have a very kinky fantasy that'll make
you go ``Eeeeewww.'' Typical ``S&AMP;C'' fare, but there's some
substance as well, as the women ponder the power of old fairy tales
and wonder whether they just want a strong man to rescue them.

 &HT;    Ex-publicist is living other side of the story
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Jane Heller was a New York publicist who promoted
such authors as Stephen King and Mary Higgins Clark on their way to
the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never once said, `I wish I could do what you're doing,'''
Heller said in a telephone interview this week. ``Then I got
promoted to vice president and the job wasn't as much fun. So I
quit.''
</P>
<P>
   She free-lanced for a while for Waldenbooks and then she got an
idea for a humorous novel about the stock market. Published in
1994, ``Cha Cha Cha'' was bought by the Literary Guild and optioned
for a television movie. Suddenly the woman who had helped publicize
other authors had her own publicist.
</P>
<P>
   Six years and six novels later, the 50-year-old Stuart, Fla.,
author has become a sort of queen of beach books. Julia Roberts'
movie company, Shoelace Productions, has bought the rights to her
sixth novel, ``Sis Boom Bah,'' and USA Today touted Heller's
latest, ``Name Dropping'' (St. Martin's, $24.95), as a great summer
read.
</P>
<P>
   Set in New York, ``Name Dropping'' is the comic tale of a
preschool teacher whose life is turned upside down when a glamorous
celebrity magazine writer with the same name moves into her
apartment building. Suddenly the teacher begins getting flowers and
invitations to gala parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my books, I write about ordinary women who get
themselves into and out of trouble and discover a new
self-confidence. They're all my alter egos.''
</P>
<P>
   As for being labeled a beach book author, Heller considers it a
compliment. ``I read serious fiction that tackles serious themes,
but I think there's also a place for old-fashioned, escapist
fiction. People need to laugh and people need to relax. If I can do
that for people, I feel pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller will sign books at 7 p.m. Monday at Chapter 11 bookstore
at Northlake (2100 Henderson Mill Road, 770-414-9288).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Book lovers looking for an out-of-print or

stored electronically in a digital library, can be printed
immediately and sent to Amazon.com for shipment. The books can be
delivered in a traditional printed format or as eBooks.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning Source president Ed Marino says the list of titles in
the digital library is growing at an average of 250 per week. ``As
Lightning Source's selection continues to grow,'' he said,
``Amazon.com will be able to offer additional hard-to-find titles

 &HT;    Prosecutors say Lewis directed cover-up
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Moments after his stretch limo sped away from where
two young men who lay mortally wounded on a Buckhead street,
prosecutors say, Ray Lewis began a concerted cover-up to escape
blame.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, he ordered members of his party to keep their
mouths shut. Later, he had evidence destroyed and lied to police,
prosecutors contend.
</P>
<P>
   While prosecutors have elicited scant evidence that Lewis
actually assaulted anyone, they are trying to convince jurors that
the star NFL linebacker had a guilty state of mind in the hours
after the killings.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis' attorneys contend there are other reasons behind his
incriminating behavior. And, in this case, Lewis cannot be
convicted of lying to police or obstructing justice because he is
charged only with the more serious crimes of murder, felony murder
and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence does tend to lend itself to an argument of a
consciousness of guilt, that is, Mr. Lewis engaged in the cover-up
because he was involved to some degree,'' former federal prosecutor
Buddy Parker said. ``It would be very important evidence if there
was an additional charge it could apply to, but they don't have
that in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, District Attorney Paul Howard presented Lewis'
statement to police the morning after the stabbings, during which
he lied by saying he couldn't identify most of the limo passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' lead defense attorney, Ed Garland, has conceded that his
client was ``not truthful'' to police. But Garland contends Lewis
was not concealing his guilt. Instead, Lewis ``panicked,'' fearing
the damaging publicity could jeopardize his NFL career, Garland
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony, Lewis did more than lie to police:
</P>
<P>
   As his limo left the crime scene, Lewis turned to his companions
and commanded, ``Keep your mouth shut and don't say nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   After he was seen huddling with his girlfriend Jessica Robertson
in his Georgian Terrace hotel room later thatmorning, Robertson
drove away and stopped behind a fast food restaurant where a fellow
limo passenger dumped a white hotel laundry bag into a Dumpster.
Prosecutors say the bag contained Lewis' bloodstained suit.
</P>
<P>
   A photo of Lewis' entourage, which would have helped police
identify the limo passengers, was destroyed. Limo passenger Evelyn
Sparks said the photo was taken from her purse by Robertson. ``She
said she burned it,'' Sparks testified.
</P>
<P>
   Co-defendant Reginald Oakley was seen wearing an oversize
sweatsuit hours after the slayings, not the outfit he wore Super
Bowl night. Prosecutors will say he got the sweatsuit from Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Jack Martin said the jury will have to sort out
which argument _ the prosecution's or the defense _ is more
believable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem for Lewis is, this type of evidence puts pressure
on him to take the stand to explain his actions,'' Martin said.
``This may be the prosecution's strategy, because their only hope
for conviction may be that the jury doesn't believe Mr. Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lewis is acquitted, Fulton prosecutors may not be able, under
the law, to indict him for a cover-up. ``You get only one bite at
charging somebody in a case like this,'' said DeKalb District
Attorney J. Tom Morgan. ``They needed to put all their eggs in one
basket.''

 &HT;    The latest generation of romance novels goes beyond the
bodice-ripper formula, reflecting real life
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Barbara Cartland died recently, it marked the end of an era
of ``no sex, please'' romance novels.
</P>
<P>
   But the romance genre had been in the midst of a revolution long
before the British author's demise.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Fabio? The blond-tressed hunk whose bare chest was
featured on the covers of hundreds of bodice-ripper novels several
years ago now makes his living pushing margarine.
</P>
<P>
   Today's romance readers _ an impressive group that buys 54
percent of the paperback fiction published _ have changed with the
times. Yes, some covers still show partially clad dashing rogues,
but most are more tasteful, with sweeping, floral illustrations.
And the swashbuckling pirates are just as likely to be found in the
nursery changing diapers.
</P>
<P>
   These are not your mother's romance novels.
</P>
<P>
   Plots that once focused on trembling virgins waiting to be
rescued by Prince Charming now feature strong, independent women
dealing with corporate infighting, office romances, adoption,
single motherhood and family life.
</P>
<P>
   Today's heroines are about as helpless as Scarlett O'Hara, says
Nora Roberts, who has penned 134 novels since 1981, racking up
sales of more than 106 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to write about someone who is sitting around
mooning at the window saying, `Someday my prince will come.' That's
not what the American woman believes or wants to read,'' she says.
``This is the woman who has her own life and is fulfilled within
herself, but who wants to find a man who is right for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic story line is the same, though. Girl meets boy,
conflict keeps them apart, and in the end they all live happily
ever after.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's romances,'' Roberts adds, ``the reader will see
more of the hero's point of view, his internal thoughts, than they
did in the '70s and early '80s. Back then, it was written all from
the heroine's point of view. Now it's 50-50, or even more from the
male point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who cut her teeth on romance novels, has added suspense
to her plots and become a best-selling hardback novelist. Others,
including Georgia writer Deborah Smith, have followed the same
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bigger books tend to mix romance, family drama and maybe
a dash of suspense or mystery,'' says Smith, the author of ``Blue
Willow'' and ``A Place to Call Home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Home, family, middle-class values, love and commitment have
always formed the core of the romance novel,'' Smith says.
``Despite shifts in styles and attitudes, tweaking the details,
updating the approach, at heart the books remain a celebration of
those ideals and society's attitude toward them at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the formula, apparently it's exactly what women want. A
1999 study commissioned by the Romance Writers of America showed
that 37.9 million women had read at least one romance novel in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Romance novels began as cheap paperbacks after World War II,
featuring heroines who were nurses, secretaries or teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fell in love with their bosses or other powerful male
figures,'' says Marietta writer Sandra Chastain. ``Women were still
seen as figures who remained in the home throughout the '50s and
'60s. The success of the romance novel may have come about because
the readers longed to escape, longed for excitement and adventure.
The romances during that time featured women who were pretty
passive.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's movement of the '60s and '70s brought more sex to
the novels, along with plots that had the heroine being swept away
by the hero. By the '80s, the women characters played a more active
role and lived more adventurous lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Chastain says, women have traveled the
world, become corporate directors who are wealthy and in a position
to choose their lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's another change taking place. Author Jennifer Blake
sees a new generation of readers ``who have seen liberation,
enjoyed it, but find it commonplace.'' These women now want home
and family and traditional values of the kind their grandmothers
knew back in the 1940s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``That accounts for the abundance of books with marriage, babies
and cowboys on the covers and as subjects,'' says Chastain, one of
the founders of the Georgia Romance Writers group. ``We're back to
John Wayne, Mom and apple pie. Women go `home' again, searching for
their roots and looking for the boy next door.''
</P>
<P>
   That, incidentally, is the plot for Roberts' recent best seller
``Carolina Moon.'' The heroine returns to her hometown in South
Carolina to open a shop and try to solve the murder of a childhood
friend. Of course, in the process she falls in love with her dead
friend's brother.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes are affecting romance novels as well: among them,
the disappearance of publishers and the emergence of e-books.
Subgenres have sprung up as well. BET Arabesque and Genesis are
publishing African-American romances; Steeple Hill, Multnomah and
Barbour are focusing on inspirational novels; and Kensington has
just released a line of Latin American romances written in Spanish
and English in the same volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes have been positive for women of color,'' says
Carmen Green (``Endless Love,'' ``Sister, Sister''). ``In 1994,
Kensington started the Arabesque line of books written by and
targeted to the African-American female audience. What they
discovered is that women between the ages of 18 and 80 loved these
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Although predominantly read by black women, the stories are
inclusive of every race. The types of plots that are hot right now,
Green says, are stories that depict families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a series starting with `Silken Love' and `Keeping
Secrets,' featuring the Crawford family. I never planned a third
story, but because of the positive response, I've written `Endless
Love,' the final story about the family.''
</P>
<P>
   African-American relationships are essentially no different from
white relationships, she adds. The characters typically have to
overcome some type of obstacle to achieve their goal. There are a
few subtle differences, though, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can identify with common situations like
blue-light-in-the-basement parties, barbecue in the yard on the
Fourth of July, banding together, breaking apart or remembering the
deep emotions at Grandma's funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the online bookstores emerged,'' says author Stephanie
Bond, ``readers were at the mercy of shrinking shelf space
dominated by a handful of best-selling authors. ... But now romance
readers, who are notoriously voracious, go online to find more of
what they like, to make new discoveries and to share their likes
and dislikes in chat forums. Since many romance authors have their
own Web sites, the reader feels more connected to the writer and
the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, meanwhile, has been signed as one of the first authors to
be published in Time Warner's eBook program through its iPublish
division. The 50,000-word book ``Alice at Heart'' will be produced
solely in digital format. No publishing date has been set, but the
story revolves around a young woman who learns she has an island
legacy including three aging half-sisters who claim to be mermaids.
</P>
<P>
   Harlequin Books, the world's largest publisher of women's
fiction, has turned to the Internet (www.eHarlequin.com) to foster
more interest in the genre. The Web site offers information about
all things romantic, including a book that is serialized each week.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, MightyWords (www.mightywords.com) launched two new
e-romance series, ``The Lipstick Chronicles'' and ``Seven Deadly
Sins'' ($2.50 per installment).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lipstick Chronicles'' _ described as a cross between
``Ally McBeal'' and ``Sex and the City'' _ is the story of five
feisty women who run Allheart.com, an online greeting card company
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven Deadly Sins'' features 28 installments of four short
romances dealing, of course, with each sin. Romance writers
contributing are Mary Jo Putney, Jennifer Blake, Stella Cameron and
Justine Dare.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what format is used to tell the stories, however, one
thing remains the same, Chastain says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In pure romance, the one requirement for women who read and
write romance is that there has to be an uplifting or happy
ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Don O'Briant writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    Dirt racing to hit Bristol
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dirt-track stock-car racing is set to run what is expected to be
its breakthrough event this weekend at Bristol Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete surface used during Winston Cup and Busch Grand
National series races has been covered with 18 inches of clay, and
the Woodstock-based Hav-A-Tampa Dirt Racing Series is set to run
races tonight and Saturday. The World of Outlaws sprint car series
will be at Bristol on June 9-10.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Estes, who is promoting the races at Bristol, grew up
watching stock cars at the now-defunct Peach Bowl in Atlanta and at
Dixie Speedway in Woodstock, where stock cars still race on dirt
every Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The HAT series race at Bristol is much like the first NASCAR
Winston Cup race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Estes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a breakthrough event,'' he said. ``There are drivers who
have always dreamed of running at Bristol, but their career paths
took them somewhere other than the Winston Cup circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 drivers already have told series officials that
they are planning to try to earn one of the 30 starting positions.
</P>
<P>
   The races also will be a chance for dirt-racing fans to
experience the amenities of a first-class speedway. And a chance
for people who normally watch NASCAR races from air-conditioned
suites to see a dirt race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be 5,000 people in the suites this weekend, and
many of them have never seen a dirt race,'' Estes said.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway officials are expecting as many as 30,000 spectators.
However, the number won't approach a sellout, because Bristol can
accommodate more than 150,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the response has been more than Estes and others
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We way underestimated the potential of these dirt races,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, The Dirt Track at Lowe's Motor Speedway, a
half-mile dirt oval adjacent to the superspeedway, opened to a
capacity crowd for its first race, a World of Outlaws sprint-car
race.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12,000 people attended a preliminary feature Thursday,
and more than 19,000 packed in to see Friday's main event.
</P>
<P>
   Estes said the HAT series and the World of Outlaws are drawing
well because they put on a good show. And their top drivers, such
as Scott Bloomquist and Sammy Swindell, have name recognition among
race fans in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``They run side by side, they do a lot of passing, and they
don't mind bumping into each other,'' Estes said. ``And for a $35
ticket, fans can see preliminary races, six heats, a last-chance
race and the feature race.''
</P>
<P>
   Swindell tested at Bristol last week and ran a lap at 141.088
mph in his sprint car, and Bloomquist's Late Model went 121.443
mph. Winston Cup driver Steve Park holds the record for stock cars
at 126.370 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomquist, a veteran driver and the all-time HAT win leader,
was in awe of the track after his test run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fast, demanding race track,'' he said, ``for both
man and machine.''

 &HT;    `What injustice! What injustice!'
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The news hit hard in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   It came to Northwest Second Street from a yellow-and-black radio
tuned to WAQI-AM (710), a Cuban station called Radio Mambi. Dozens
of people were huddled around the radio in front of the house where
Elian Gonzalez lived for six months when the announcer delivered
the blow from Atlanta at 11:03 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a decision against the lawyers of the family of Elian
Gonzalez. . . `` he said in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   A young man cursed. Lips quivered. You could hear gasps from the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen found Elian on an inner tube off Fort Lauderdale last
Thanksgiving. His mother drowned trying to bring him here from
Cuba. Elian's Miami relatives want the government to give him
political asylum, but his father wants to take him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   When three judges of the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in
Atlanta announced their decision Thursday that Elian, 6, is too
young to apply for asylum, it unleashed emotions here.
</P>
<P>
   ``What injustice! What injustice!'' cried Norma Bayez, a
58-year-old Cuban-American.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of about 100 people in the street in front of the
house where Elian used to live, there to protest the government's
handling of the case. At least one woman at the house Thursday was
overcome by heat and emotion_or perhaps a combination of the two.
An ambulance took her away.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported no arrests or violence in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Astengo, an unemployed security guard who came here from
Cuba in 1979, shouted and cut the air with his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't trust no more in the government because they're a
bunch of traitors! Now we don't trust the justice system of this
country!'' he said. ``I lost my hope about this country. I thought
this was the best country in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Miami's powerful Cuban community urged calm.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader of the Democracia Movement, said he
expected demonstrations beyond the shouting and sign-waving that
defined Northwest Second Street immediately before and after word
spread of the decision in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' he said. ``There are cases in which
the voice of a child should be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he and other Cuban-American leaders were talking about a
flotilla that would sail toward Cuba, stopping just short of its
territorial waters, as a symbolic escort for Elian should the
courts determine that his father can take him back to the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is about freedom and about giving people the
opportunity to live in freedom, and we haven't done that with Elian
Gonzalez,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Bill Schwartz, spokesman for the Miami Police Department,
said officers planned to keep a low profile but were ready for any
unrest that might erupt. He said no cops were working overtime
Thursday, but some plainclothes officers were keeping riot gear
within reach, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intelligence tells us we won't need them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Basulto, founder of the anti-Castro group Brothers to the
Rescue, spent several hours answering reporters' questions. He was
walking towards a radio reporter in the shade when Astengo, the
27-year-old former security guard, raced up and draped his right
arm on Basulto's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senor Basulto! Tenemos que hacer algo!'' he said. ``Mr.
Basulto! We have to do something!''
</P>
<P>
   Just what could be done, though, was not clear. Basulto said the
lawyers would make the next move, perhaps an appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court. The demonstrators, meanwhile, tried to comfort each
other as they lingered for hours in front of the house. Elian's
relatives no longer live there, but it has become a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 signs hang from a chain-link fence out front. One shows
Elian nailed to a cross and asks the world not to crucify him.
Several demonstrators wore T-shirts that each showed the photo of a
federal agent forcibly retrieving Elian during an April 22 raid in
the house. The red block letters above and below the picture varied
from shirt to shirt, from ``Federal Child Abuse'' to ``The First
Infamous Crime of the New Millenium'' to ``Elian_Miami is With
You.''
</P>
<P>
   People in the protest shirts tried to encourage each other all
afternoon. Many see it as far more than a custody fight. They see
it instead as a struggle against the communist system that Fidel
Castro imposed on Cuba in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   One woman reproached another who could not seem to stop crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what Fidel wants _ to see us crying,'' she implored.
``We need to be strong and show him that we're better than he is.''

conservatives are promoting adoption as an alternative to abortion.
But the Supreme Court this week let stand an Oregon law that gives
adults adopted as children the right to see their original birth
certificates, whether their birth parents agree or not. This is
unfair to mothers who gave up their unwanted babies counting on
having their privacy protected. The fear of being confronted later
by an abandoned child may discourage adoptions. By MARIANNE MEANS.

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ Senate approval of the
House-passed China trade bill should put relations with Beijing on
a more even and productive course than they have been in recent
years. A look at the history of U.S.-China encounters over the last
three decades shows that ironically old foes can become new
friends. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (Already filed.)

WHEN NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say goodbye to the Sports Illustrated cover jinx.
</P>
<P>
   It's been replaced by Anna Kournikova, the new SI cover minx.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers to the magazine who opened their mailboxes this week
might have thought there was a sequel to the swimsuit edition.
Nope. Just Anna, showing us what the phrase ``bedroom eyes'' means
as she clutches a pillow in a shoulderless blouse framed by her
ravishing mane of blonde hair on the June 5 issue.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   If the tennis tart made the magazine's cover every week, who'd
complain?
</P>
<P>
   You'd be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get second-guessed on our covers 45 out of 52 weeks,
especially when there's a feature cover,'' SI managing editor Bill
Colson said Thursday morning as the issue began to make local
newsstand vendors reconsider whether ID checks were needed to sell
this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone always thinks there's a news event more important than
whatever feature we have,'' Colson added.
</P>
<P>
   Such as this week, with the NBA conference finals, the NHL
Stanley Cup Finals and the Indianapolis 500 all colliding over
Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also the French Open, which Kournikova was competing
in. Until Thursday, when she lost her second-round match.
</P>
<P>
   Not that SI expected her to win. That's the point of the story.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what intrigued preeminent sports journalist Frank
Deford to pitch the piece to Colson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jezebel of Sweat,'' Deford calls her in the story. ``At a
time when we are all supposed to be so gender-enlightened, when
pretty isn't supposed to matter anymore in the workplace,
especially in such a meritocratic domain as sports . . . here is
what Kournikova proves about Homo sapiens, male division, circa
2000: Skin-deep still counts.''
</P>
<P>
   How true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bona fide story, so why not put it on the cover when
there's a little lull (in the sports world)?'' asked Colson. ``We
obviously wanted to do it in a tasteful way, in a fun, journalistic
way. Why now? The playoffs in basketball and hockey go on for
months. We could put them on the cover every week. We had a
basketball cover last week and will probably have one next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just different. We hardly ever do a cover like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Except every February when some women in (name an exotic locale)
do work on their Victoria's Secret resume.
</P>
<P>
   Which gave Colson a thought about Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she'll do the swimsuit issue next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   __ More titillation: Under the headline ``Sweetness: Fox Media
Star Lisa Guerrero has the Hottest Moves in the Business'' is Sport
magazine's idea of a feature on the L.A. TV journalist in its June
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and by the way, there's a picture of Sweet Lisa with her
hair pulled up, laying out on a blue leather couch in some kind of
black get-up that has the author of the story, Darryl Howerton,
tripping all over his media credential.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the interview, it wasn't like his tongue was hanging
out,'' said Guerrero, in Detroit this week working on FX's
``Toughman'' competition show. ``I thought the story and picture
was very nice and flattering. That's who I am. I don't get hung up
on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should care more about (my image in that light), but
it's just fun and sports. It's not as if I'm some hardcore news
journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   As she was trying to be with Hugh Downs for Fox's live tomb
excavation special from Egypt two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very fine line,'' continued Guerrero, who next week
will shoot a magazine cover for Women's World Weekly (a fitness
publication) and Oye (an Hispanic men's publication). ``From a
programming and magazine standpoint, you need someone attractive to
sell. Hopefully, I'm not crossing that line.''
</P>
<P>
   __ A classy 20 years: As Cable News Network celebrates two
decades of operation this week _ it went on the air June 1, 1980 _
``Sports Tonight,'' which started with Fred Hickman and Nick
Charles, deserves recognition for its commitment to journalism in a
cable sports field fighting for viewer attention.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's sports division, which has produced such talent as Keith
Olbermann, Dan Patrick, Hannah Storm, Dan Hicks and Van Earl
Wright, finds itself under the watch of Jim Walton. He began at CNN
as a news journalist in '81, switched to sports as a tape editor in
'83 and vaulted to executive producer in '85 after his work for the
network on coverage of the '84 Los Angeles Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early days of CNN were a time when there was not enough
resources to do what we wanted to do,'' Walton said. ``It was
nonunion, so we all did everything. And we learned from a great
person in Bill MacPhail (hired by Ted Turner to run the operation
after his days at CBS Sports).''
</P>
<P>
   As ESPN and Fox have developed their own wacky ways of
presenting sports, CNN remains a reliable alternative, available in
many forms. Aside from the 24-hour CNN-SI channel, the ``Sports
Tonight'' hosted by Hickman and Vince Cellini is the news show's
main sports element. Then there's the 20- and 50-minute updates on
CNN Headline News and an affiliate feed service that provides many
local TV stations (including all in L.A.) video highlight packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot depends on what you want,'' admits Walton. ``Some go
after the laugh or the fancy graphics, and some go after substance.
That's just society. Different people like different things.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   __ Joe McDonnell's year-and-a-half disappearance from regular
sports talk ends Sunday night with a KABC-AM (790) show from 9 p.m.
to 1 a.m. _ the same time slot he used to have great success with
years ago on KFI-AM (640). ``That's what's so appealing _ it'll be
just like the old days,'' said McDonnell, who'll continue doing
sports updates for all-news KFWB-AM (980) during weekday afternoon
drive-time. Another old twist to this gig: Columnist Doug
Krikorian, who worked with McDonnell at the old KMPC when it was an
all-sports station on 710-AM a few years back, rejoins his
partner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ CBS NFL analyst Sam Wyche, who was supposed to do work on The
Nashville Network's coverage of Arena Football League games this
season, will have surgery next month to have vocal cords repaired.
They were mistakenly severed during an operation in March when
noncancerous lymph nodes were removed from his lungs. ``It's been a
nightmare,'' Wyche told the Cincinnati Post. ``My one-word opinion
of it is, it's been a nightmare. But it's all done now.'' &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Zero tolerance for any more Bobby Knight media interviews.
Outside of Roy Firestone actually admitting during Tuesday's ESPN
egg-toss that he never saw the original CNN-SI video of The General
choking former player Neil Reed, of Knight hand-picking seven
reporters to talk to before the TV show (henceforth known as the
``Sympathetic Seven''), and then seeing the picture over the wire
services of Knight thanking ESPN stage manager Gail Green during a

</P>
<P>
   __ The fifth season of HBO's ``Arli$$'' somehow begins Sunday.
By episode two, you'll probably be hoping that the cast of ``The
Sopranos'' rubs out Robert Wuhl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Why stop at allowing ABC Sports chief Howard Katz to waive
the green flag and officially start the Indianapolis 500? That
wasn't a ceremonial gesture _ it was the real deal. He screws up
and there's the chance of a 33-car pileup. You gotta believe NBC
Sports czar Dick Ebersol would love to toss up the opening tip for
the NBA Finals next week. But he can't. He shouldn't. Neither
should Katz, nor ABC, take advantage of their rights-fee clout by
becoming more than innocent bystanders.

CELERA GENOMICS ANNOUNCES MAJOR PROGRESS IN DECODING MOUSE GENOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the outcome of the race to decode the human genome expected
to be declared sometime this month, one of the two competitors said
Thursday that it had made progress in an important follow-up race,
decoding the genome of the mouse, which is expected to be critical
to interpreting the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Celera Genomics, said that in the last two months
it had sequenced, or determined the order of, more than a billion
units of DNA from the mouse genome. Celera's rival, a public
consortium of academic centers in the United States, Europe and
Japan, has sequenced only 85 million DNA units of the mouse genome.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists believe the mouse genome will be essential to
interpreting the human genome. Although the two species diverged
about 100 million years ago, their genomes are about the same size,
3 billion units of DNA, and most human genes have counterparts in
the mouse genome, recognizable because of the similarity of their
DNA sequences.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest general method for identifying all the human genes
may be simply to lay the mouse and human genomes side by side and
to look for regions where the strings of DNA units are similar. The
DNA units in genes will have mostly stayed the same in mouse and
human, whereas the 97 percent of the genome that does not code for
genes will have diverged over the course of evolution, biologists
expect.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the mouse genome should help identify the role of human
genes, most of which are largely unknown. A researcher with a
mystery human gene can locate the counterpart mouse gene on the
mouse genome, create a strain of mouse that lacks the gene and
figure out what it is the mouse can no longer do.
</P>
<P>
   Celera Genomics, a subsidiary of PE Corp., will need to sequence
a further 2 billion units of DNA, an additional four months' work,
to cover the mouse genome once over.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's president, Dr. J. Craig Venter, said that he would draw
the DNA from three strains of mice, to study the natural variation
of the mouse genome, and that he would assemble a ``humanized mouse
genome,'' one in which the mouse genes were arranged in the same
order as their counterparts on the human genome instead of in the
natural mouse order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sequence will be enormously useful,'' said Dr. Peter
Mombaerts, a mouse geneticist at Rockefeller University, because
genes can be targeted by reading off their DNA sequence from a
database.
</P>
<P>
   Celera said its mouse genome will be available only to
subscribers to its database. The company's main business plan is to
sell genomic data, but its problem is that the public consortium
makes all its genomic data available free. With the mouse genome,
however, Celera will be able to offer human-mouse searches
exclusively, at least until the consortium catches up on the mouse
front.
</P>
<P>
   Venter said that after the mouse he was considering decoding the
genomes of the dog, the rat or the chimpanzee, depending on his
clients' interests.
</P>
<P>
   Mouse tissue was provided to Celera by the Jackson Laboratory of
Bar Harbor, Maine, a leading mouse colony. The laboratory's
director, Dr. Kenneth Paigen, said mice were a better vehicle for
gene analysis than people because mouse tissues can be analyzed in
a fresher state and the cells' perishable gene transcripts captured
more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to combine the mouse with the human genome will be
a big plus,'' Paigen said.

SOMETIMES, CHANGE CAN BE GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When companies _ or conferences _ redesign
their logos, it's similar to rearranging the deck chairs on the
Titanic. If the symbol that has made you famous needs changing,
then maybe you're not ... famous.
</P>
<P>
   Well, TCU's future league home has redesigned its logo.
Conference USA recently unveiled a new look. But before Frog fans
start panicking and thinking that they're joining a conference
headed down Failure Freeway, know this: C-USA's new brand is an
improvement over the original and indicates that the league is
moving forward aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Still in its infancy, what C-USA lacks is the instant
identification that leagues such as the SEC, ACC, Big 10 and Big 12
have. From its inception five years ago, Conference USA has been,
well, a bit bulky. What the league is trying to move toward is the
kind of ``Oh, yeah'' recognition that other leagues have.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, we want this logo to become our `Swoosh,' ''
C-USA commissioner Mike Slive said.
</P>
<P>
   Swoosh as in Nike's swoosh brand, the second-most recognizable
symbol in sports, right behind the dollar sign. Money, income,
brand recognition, a corporate ``mark,'' marketing,
cross-licensing. Those are all terms associated with big-time
college sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we have become a more concentrated corporate
partnership program,'' Slive said. ``This gave us a linchpin to
move in a lot of different directions. We're moving into the second
phase of the conference's life. One of our strategic goals was to
enhance the name, reputation and recognition of the league. This
gives it a kick start.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, C-USA presidents ordered a new logo be developed.
Conference officials won't say how much the project cost, but it
was not a shoestring operation. SME Power Branding of New York
helped design and develop the new logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show the conference was progressive and unified;
we think the new logo shows that,'' said John McNamara, C-USA
associate commissioner for marketing and corporate development.
``With the expansion, adding TCU and East Carolina, the timing was
perfect to do something new. The original logo was fine, but it was
outdated.''
</P>
<P>
   What's unusual about C-USA's new logo is that it's the Swiss
Army knife of collegiate brands. It has three levels _ a formal
logo that includes the name Conference USA, a more informal one
with C-USA (which will be used on uniforms, courts and fields) and
a third logo that can be used with member school's logos and with
corporate partners. No other conference has one that is as
versatile.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the original logo featured 12 stars, one for each of the
original members. The new one has one star.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some symbolism there,'' Slive said. ``That reinforces
the strength of the conference and the unity of our member
schools.''  &LR; subheds:Briefly C-USA's athletic directors have agreed
to basketball divisional setups to accommodate new members TCU and
East Carolina in 2001-2002. East Carolina probably would be added
to the American Division, with TCU being placed in the National
(which currently includes South Florida, Alabama-Birmingham,
Memphis, Houston, Southern Miss and Tulane). The league's
presidents are expected to vote on the AD's recommendations this
month or in August.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's Roy Firestone, the main interviewer of Indiana coach Bob
Knight during his invitation-only media spin session this week,
didn't do much to change Knight's less-than-respectful view of
journalists. The key piece of evidence against Knight has been the
videotape of Knight with his hand on Neil Reed's neck. Firestone
admitted he had not seen the 2.3 seconds of video. With that
admission, there was no credibility to the one-hour interview.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech nearly won the national championship in football
last season and is now reaping the benefits. A record 23,000 season
tickets have been sold and a $22 million, 12,000-seat expansion of
Lane Stadium is being planned. And CBS has picked the Hokies for
four national telecasts, the maximum number under its contract with
the Big East Conference.

TEXAS COUNTING ON TALENTED PITCHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Penn State catcher Joe Puliafico took some pains this week to
assure everyone that, while the Nittany Lions may be from a faraway
land, they have dutifully kept abreast of developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we know about Texas' pitching?'' he said. ``Well,
let's be honest _ we know a lot. Those guys are all over /Baseball
America''. We've read about them, and they're very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   /Baseball America'' thanks you for the plug, Joe. And while
you're admiring the literary profiles of D.J. Jones, Beau Hale and
Charlie Thames, here's a name you haven't seen for a few months:
</P>
<P>
   Phil Seibel.
</P>
<P>
   Around the environs of Disch-Falk Field, where Texas (44-19)
will host Penn State (45-17) at 7 p.m. tonight in the opener of
abest-of-three Super Regional, Seibel's timely return has been
tantamount to a knock on the door from the prodigal son. And he
could be the final piece of the puzzle that sends the Longhorns to
the College World Series for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He was there at the beginning of the season, when Texas pitching
seemed truly brilliant and the Longhorns rose to a No. 2 national
ranking. Having handed his 1999 closer role over to Thames, Seibel
had a 4-1 record and a 1.99 earned-run average as the Sunday
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Then on March 5, he threw a pitch against Missouri and strained
a ligament in his elbow. Rehabilitation took 2 1/2 months.
</P>
<P>
   He next pitched in the Big 12 Tournament, drawing an
experimental start and throwing 60 pitches in a game Texas
eventually lost. Then, with the Longhorns facing elimination at the
regional Sunday in Tempe, Ariz., Seibel took the mound against
Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he stuck around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   In 6 1/3 innings, he allowed five hits, three runs _ one earned
_ walked two and struck out six. With relief help from Thames, he
picked up the victory, lowered his ERA, and vaulted the Longhorns
into a championship game against the Sun Devils, which Texas won,
9-7.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful left-hander who normally throws in the 90s, Seibel
said he ``probably isn't 100 percent yet, but this is close enough;
I'll take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw everything ... fastball, slider, changeup ... and they
all worked and there was no pain. Actually, my elbow feels fine, I
just don't feel totally right with some other stuff. I feel I'm
still missing a little zip from the layoff, and I think I was in
the upper 80s. But I had good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   During the latter part of the season, life without Seibel took a
toll on the Longhorns, who developed a debilitating habit of losing
the Sunday game in every key series. With Seibel rejoining the
rotation, coach Augie Garrido will be back in the position of
putting a strong arm on the mound in every situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Tempe, the whole pitching staff was awesome, and Phil's
return just highlighted it,'' Garrido said. ``D.J. got us off to a
good start, and the best-pitched game of the tournament may have
been the one Beau Hale lost. Plus we got a complete-game win from
Ray Clark, the first of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil gives us that extra option we haven't had for two months.
In fact, the guy who seems to be struggling right now is Charlie.
I'm thinking about maybe giving him a start, just to change the
pattern, because he's putting a lot of pressure on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we seem to have also gotten our offense back, and we're
even hitting home runs. I think there's a little extra bounce in
our step right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Seibel, a junior from Cypress, Calif., was also putting pressure
on himself, and he figures that was a big part of the rehab
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason it took so long,'' he said, ``is because
for about the first month, I kept trying to work in the bullpen and
force the injury to go away. I kept thinking maybe I could start a
game and pitch out of it. But it just kept getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   He had his arm examined at the Jobe Clinic in California and
they prescribed a completely different rehab plan: total rest. For
the next month, he didn't pick up a baseball until throwing against
Sam Houston State two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound funny, but I think I got well when I stopped
caring about it so much. In Tempe, I had fun. I was relaxed and
just throwing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll stick with that.''

GORE PLEDGES TO INCREASE FEDERAL SPENDING FOR CANCER RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA, Ga. _ Invoking World War II and the race to the moon,
Vice President Al Gore pledged on Thursday to double federal
spending on cancer research and to make ``a flood'' of new cancer
treatments and tests available to all Americans who need them.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech brimming with soaring oratory and buoyant optimism,
Gore described the nation as standing on the brink of medical
breakthroughs fueled by genetic research, and called on the federal
government to use its resources to turn those discoveries into
preventing and curing the most fatal cancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am entrusted with the presidency, I will work with you to
put the same energy and priority into fighting cancer that we would
put into preventing a war that could take 500,000 American lives
every year,'' Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, told more than
600 people at Emory University Medical School. ``The stakes are
that great. We can win this war.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech offered a vivid example of the recent tactical shift
by Gore away from attacking his likely Republican rival, Gov.
George W. Bush, and toward outlining his own vision in strikingly
upbeat terms.
</P>
<P>
   All this week, Gore, who has been criticized by some Democrats
as appearing overly harsh on the campaign trail, has brought a
softer, more personal, even intimate touch to his events.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gore and an Army friend described their experiences
in Vietnam. On Tuesday, he and his wife, Tipper, who has been
treated for depression, appeared together at a mental health forum.
And on Thursday, Gore referred to the death of his sister, Nancy,
from lung cancer and brought along her husband, Frank Hunger, to
talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At Emory on Thursday, Gore outlined a multi-point plan for
battling cancer, portions of which he had discussed before. He
called for doubling, to $9 billion, the amount the federal
government will spend over the next five years on cancer research.
He advocated legislation to make clinical trials available to more
adults and to require Medicare to pay for more cancer-screening
tests. And he vowed to make changes to the Food and Drug
Administration that would speed the approval of new cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The address was short on policy details but long on sweeping
phrases and historical analogies meant to inspire his audience. For
example, Gore cited President John F. Kennedy's vow to put a man on
the moon 40 years ago as a precedent for his own ambitious goal: to
end all deaths from colon, breast and prostate cancer by the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say it is impossible to find the answer to many forms of
cancer,'' Gore said. ``I don't agree. One hundred years ago they
said the same thing about smallpox. And 60 years ago they said the
same thing about polio. They were wrong then. The pioneers and
activists such as all of you convince me that the naysayers are
wrong again now.''
</P>
<P>
   He also likened the mapping of the human genome, the template
for genetic traits, to the Allies' breaking Nazi Germany's military
code in World War II. The genome map, which is nearing completion,
is widely expected to hasten the development of new drugs and
screening tests for serious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the verge of cracking another enemy secret code,''
Gore said. ``This enemy kills more Americans every single year than
all the Americans who died throughout the entirety of World War II.
When we intercept the messages that cancer sends secretly coded
from cell to cell, we are going to turn the tide. We will gain the
ability to decisively win the war against cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president reiterated his support for having the Food
and Drug Administration regulate tobacco to prevent cigarette
companies from selling ``deadly products'' to adolescents. Teen
smoking, he said, was ``the number one preventable form of death
and disease in America today.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the 1996 Democratic National Convention, Gore gave a now
famous speech in which he described with searing detail the death
of his older sister, Nancy, from lung cancer in 1984. The address,
meant to highlight the Clinton administration's war on smoking,
brought tears to some convention-goers eyes. But it also prompted
critics to suggest that Gore had exploited a painful family chapter
for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gore obliquely referred to his sister's death
without mentioning her. But he tried to show that her illness had
changed him, giving him an emotional bond with cancer victims and
infusing him with a passion to see the disease cured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know from my own family's experience what cancer can do to a
family,'' he said. ``Many of us here have made sense of a loss by
rededicating ourselves to the hope of a cure for other's loved
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The event also started on an tearful note as the man who
introduced Gore, Patrick Kardian, repeatedly choked up as he
described his own battle with Hodgkins Disease. At one point, Gore
wrapped an arm around Kardian and whispered in his ear, ``You're
doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposals outlined by Mr. Gore were the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Speeding up the process for having Medicare, the government
health care program for the elderly and disabled, pay for new
diagnostic tests for cancer. Under Gore's plan, a panel of medical
experts would make recommendations on new tests worthy of Medicare
coverage. If Congress did not act on a recommendation within 60
days, Medicare would automatically begin paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing by fivefold the number of patients participating in
cancer clinical trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.
Gore asserts that survival rates for children with cancer have
risen sharply because most of those children participate in
clinical tests. But less than 3 percent of adults with cancer
participate in clinical tests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Passing legislation that would prohibit discrimination based
on a person's genetic makeup. Gore argued that few people would
undergo genetic tests that could pinpoint the potential for cancer
if they feared losing their jobs or health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extending Medicaid coverage to people who are diagnosed with
certain cancers, including breast and cervical, through federal
screening programs, but lack health insurance.

BILL TO BAN WOMEN FROM PRAYING AT WESTERN WALL IS BACKED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a move that shows the strains between religious
and secular Jews in Israel, ultra-Orthodox parliamentarians have
won initial support for a bill setting a seven-year jail term for
women who wear prayer shawls and read from Torah scrolls at the
Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, the first of three, sparked outrage Thursday from
women's rights activists and liberal parliamentarians, who warned
that such a bill undermines Israel's democracy and undercuts
women's rights. While unlikely to become law, the bill puts further
strain on Prime Minister Ehud Barak's unwieldy governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is fundamentalist in its essence and truly
frightening,'' said Naomi Chazan, a parliamentarian from the
liberal Meretz party, which is part of the governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do everything to prevent Israel from turning into an
Afghanistan or Iran,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, supported by the three religious parties in Barak's
governing coalition, was introduced Wednesday in response to last
week's Supreme Court decision giving a women's prayer group the
right to pray at the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City. It
passed 32-26 in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
   The court decision had been condemned by Israeli Orthodox
rabbis, most of whom do not believe that Jewish religious law
allows women to do certain things normally reserved for men, such
as donning a prayer shawl while praying or reading aloud from Torah
scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   The bill seeks to block the Supreme Court's ruling by banning
women from holding religious ceremonies near the Wall, which is
already split into men's and women's sections.
</P>
<P>
   The bill states, ``No religious ceremony will be held in the
women's section of the Wall, which includes reading from Torah
scrolls, Shofar blowing, wearing prayer shawls or tefillin.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer for the Women of the Wall, which filed its first
court petition 11 years ago, said that for now, the bill pending in
parliament did not free the government from following the ruling of
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The three judges gave the government six months to come up with
a way to allow the Women of the Wall, which is composed of
Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Jews, to pray at the Western
Wall. ``That decision is binding, there is no court order
suspending the enforcement of that decision, therefore the
government must comply with it,'' said lawyer Jonathan Misheiker.
</P>
<P>
   The view of what women can and cannot do in religious services
is one that differs among Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, where state and religion are not separate, all Jews
fall under the purview of the Orthodox rabbis, who control
marriage, divorce, and conversion.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past few years, non-Orthodox Jews have struggled to
break the Orthodox religious monopoly, setting off bitter political
and court battles over whether Orthodox rabbis should be allowed to
define Judaism for all Jews.

   SEC to give Atlanta two more championship games
</P>
<P>
   By Tony Barnhart
</P>
<P>
   C.2000, Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DESTIN, Fla. _ Trying to shore up its position in the Atlanta
market, the Southeastern Conference will award the 2004 and 2005
men's basketball tournaments to the Georgia Dome today.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001SEC basketball tournament will be in Nashville, with the
2002 event back in Atlanta, which also will host the Final Four
that season. The 2003 tournament will be at the Super Dome in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC presidents will make the decision official with their
vote today, when the conference's annual spring meetings close.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic Coast Conference has shown signs that it wants its
tournament to have a stronger presence in the Atlanta market. In
March the ACC tournament will return to Atlanta for the first time
since 1989. The ACC is expected to award another tournament to the
Georgia Dome, for either 2009 or 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan's new deal
</P>
<P>
   Florida basketball coach Billy Donovan, who led the Gators to
the Final Four in only his fourth season, has been rewarded with a
five-year, $6 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan's annual salary of $1.2 million ties him with Kentucky's
Tubby Smith as the highest-paid basketball coach in the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Steve Spurrier is college football's highest-paid
coach at $2 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   Six-hour rule
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is contemplating a rule that would require football
players to pass a minimum of six hours in the fall quarter in order
to be eligible for a bowl game. The rule would apply to all sports,
but the focus is on football.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior football players who think they are going to be high
draft choices quit going to class in their final season. Then they
leave school to prepare for a professional career.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Florida already has a rule that applies to all
schools in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Some athletics directors agree with the idea in principle but
are concerned the rule might put the SEC at a disadvantage in bowl
games against teams that don't have to adhere to such a rule. They
think the rule should be passed at the NCAA level.
</P>
<P>
   Deuce loose in Costa Rica
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi running back Deuce McAllister, a Heisman Trophy
candidate, has spent the past three weeks in Costa Rica picking up
some extra credits in Spanish. McAllister is living with a local
family, going to class in the morning, and working out in the
afternoon. He will pick up six hours of Spanish, which will put him
closer to his goal of graduating in December.
</P>
<P>
   Coach David Cutcliffe says he is trying to stay calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I was worried, because they've had some problems over
there,'' Cutcliffe said.
</P>
<P>
   Two American students were killed in Costa Rica earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   McAllister told Cutcliffe to look on the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least, he thought it would get me away from agents,''
McAllister told the Memphis Commercial Appeal.
</P>
<P>
   McAllister is scheduled to return to Oxford, Miss., today.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is expected to announce today that its members will
share a record $73 million in revenues from televised football and
basketball. Last year, the 12 schools shared $68.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC championship football game, Dec. 2 at the Georgia Dome,
already is a sellout. The only tickets now available are the 15,900
that will go to each of the two participating teams.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC presidents will discuss a change in the transfer rule.
Only football and basketball players who transfer from SEC schools
have to sit out a year. The new rule would make athletes in all
sports sit out a year.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's football opener at UCLA will be televised on ABC, with
a kickoff of 3:30 p.m. It will be Alabama's first game in
Pasadena's Rose Bowl since Jan. 1, 1946, when the Crimson Tide beat
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have started for the television rights to the SEC
football championship game. ABC has held the rights since the game
started in 1992. The contract ends this year.

   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Donald Trump has mortgaged Mar-a-Lago for
nearly $25 million, Palm Beach County property records show.
</P>
<P>
   Trump took out two loans on the 118-room estate on April 26 _
one for $19,883,870 and one for $5 million _ with Union Labor Life
Insurance Co. of Washington. The loans are payable over 10 years,
Trump said.
</P>
<P>
   Mar-a-Lago has an assessed value of $22.2 million, property
records show. Trump paid $10 million for the former Marjorie
Merriweather Post estate and its furnishings in 1995, and another
$2 million for a beach parcel. Union Labor handled Mar-a-Lago's
original $10 million mortgage in 1995, company Vice President
Herbert Kolben said. He declined to discuss terms of the new loans.
</P>
<P>
   Trump almost had the original mortgage paid off. Before these
new loans, his mortgage was down to $116,130, said Joy Hearn, Palm
Beach County's senior property appraiser. Mortgage records show he
can borrow up to $50 million on the 17-acre property, now a private
club, in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper and magazine reports have said Trump needed the money
to help pay a $26 million debt to the financially strapped Trump
Hotels &AMP; Resorts, the casino company he took public to help him pay
off creditors. He borrowed that $26 million to pay a personal loan
to Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette, the New York investment bank, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Trump on Thursday denied he took additional Mar-a-Lago financing
to pay his casino loan, which was due May 15. He said he paid that
off a week early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mar-a-Lago has always been mortgaged,'' Trump said. ``I've
always had financing in varying amounts, from $25 million to
nothing. ... It's good for tax purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Mar-a-Lago loans don't mean he's in financial
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best year I've ever had in business,'' he said.
``Manhattan real estate has gone up even more than Florida has.''

CARRIERS BATTLE TO CORNER BOSTON BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hub airports _ where one airline dominates and flies
nonstop to dozens, if not hundreds, of cities _ are common.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston, the so-called Hub of the Universe, is reaping the
benefits of not being the hub for any airline.
</P>
<P>
   The city's lucrative mix of business and leisure passengers,
combined with a significant population base and robust economy,
have the airlines battling in a high-stakes game to become the
dominant carrier in a place where location _ the Northeast corner
of the country _ makes it impossible to have traditional
hub-and-spoke operations.
</P>
<P>
   For passengers, the fierce competition is bringing cutting-edge
services, new terminal facilities, and fare wars as airlines pour
money into Logan International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Logan, John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, and
Los Angeles International Airport are the only large US airports
where four airlines have at least 10 percent of the market. Nowhere
is the market as fragmented as in Boston, where 11 percentage
points separates number one from number four.
</P>
<P>
   While paid-in-advance fares out of Providence are lower than in
Boston _ because of the presence of no-frills Southwest Airlines _
fares from Logan are still more competitive than they would be in a
city where one airline dominates, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the corporations we deal with benefit'' from the
competition, said Jim Carter, regional director of sales for
American Airlines. ``They are seeing very aggressive program
proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's demographics _ its size and the mix of business and
leisure travelers _ make it too attractive for airlines to ignore
or to let their competitors walk away with the market.
</P>
<P>
   About nine out of every 10 passengers at Logan use Boston as
their origin or destination, a staggering figure in the airline
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Logan ranks second only to Orlando, which has 94
percent of its passengers starting or ending their journeys in that
Florida vacation destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is one of the few major markets in the US today that
does not have clear carrier leadership,'' said Doug Blisset, vice
president of network analysis for Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, you have four carriers with equal revenue in
Boston. The size of the market is so significant that if you can
build a `top of the mind' or `carrier of choice' presence, the
benefits are significant _ and the profit base is potentially very
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed merger of United Airlines and US Airways shrinks
that number to three, the competition will still be fierce. And
what would become the number two and number three carriers _ Delta
and American, respectively _ are not about to give up the quest for
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Both have announced major terminal projects worth more than $600
million combined. Delta alone plans to spend about $350 million in
private funds to build a new Terminal A, which will make it the
only airline in Boston with its own terminal.
</P>
<P>
   And long before Terminal A is complete, Delta passengers will be
able to check in at the central parking garage and obtain boarding
passes there. Airline officials say it is all part of an effort to
make the Atlanta-based carrier foremost in the minds of New
Englanders.
</P>
<P>
   Leo F. Mullin, Delta's president, chairman, and chief executive,
has made ``winning in the Northeast and the North Atlantic'' major
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the Northeast, the cornerstones are New York
and Boston,'' Mullin said in an interview shortly before the recent
United-US Airways merger announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both of those cities, we have 22 or 23 percent of the
market share. We have weaponry in Boston: the main line, the
shuttle, Delta Express and Comair, and our international alliance
with Air France. With our Terminal A expansion, we have the
intention of service to London, Paris, Rome, Dublin, and
Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is a crucial element in terms of winning in the
Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta also plans to woo customers with upgraded service. It is
wiring Terminal A for a local area network that will extend to the
parking garage, allowing for remote check-in for passengers who
want to avoid lines inside the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are reluctant to say much about the plan, which is at
least a year away from being put into service. But Rick Danner,
Delta's regional director of customer service, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are leaving Boston, we want you to think of driving
to the (parking garage's) fourth floor to check in with Delta. Once
you are there, it will be the start of a whole new experience for
airline check-in.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta is also continuing to expand its schedule in Boston and
will begin twice-daily nonstop service to Los Angeles on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   United recently increased the number of nonstops to LAX to five
daily. American also offers frequent nonstop service to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think three strong carriers in that market is a good
thing,'' said American's Carter. ``Competing against United and
Delta helps us be that much better when you are competing against
world class airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   More competition also means lower fares.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has announced an introductory round-trip fare to Los
Angeles of about $350, less than half the cost of the lowest fare
avialable for the last weekend in June. All the airlines matched
Delta's fare, beginning in July.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger with US Airways goes through without major impact
on the route structure in Boston, United will be the largest
airline at Logan, with more than 30 percent of the market. But the
airline will have logistical issues as it consolidates operations,
because United is expanding in Terminal C, while US Airways has
more gates in Terminal B, where it is also expanding.
</P>
<P>
   United's city manager, Diane Bergan, said the airline's
long-term strategy is to grow internationally and domestically from
Boston, no matter which terminal it operates from.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just completed one year of service to London with a perfect
reliability record,'' she said. ``The strong competition in Boston
provides significant choices for consumers and makes Boston very
attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   United also is slated to bring its Chariots _ mobile check-in
stations that can be moved to where there are long lines _ to
Boston. They're due by the end of this year or early in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   And American Airlines this year announced a major expansion of
its facilities in Terminal B. The carrier will add about 300,000
square feet of terminal space, letting it bring the Boeing 777
jumbo jet to Boston without having to shut down an adjacent gate
because of the plane's wingspan.
</P>
<P>
   An American spokeswoman vowed that ``we will be competitive'' in
Boston. ``It is a very important city to us, by virtue of our $270
million expansion effort.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also significant benefits to the Massachusetts Port
Authoirty, which owns and operates Logan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines recognize that they need to spend money to
attract passengers, and you would not have that if we were
dominated by one airline,'' said Virginia Buckingham, the
authority's executive director and CEO. ``It makes it easier for
Massport to leverage private investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham said Massport may be able to use the United-US
Airways deal to free up terminal space for other airlines. ``Right
now, we have no place to put them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, high demand for space and limited supply have let
Massport begin innovative lease arrangements, whereby the authority
can demand that an airline turn over its gates if they are not used
frequently enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the option of stepping in and pulling some gates back
to get them up to the average,'' said Thomas J. Kinton Jr.,
Massport's aviation director. ``Over time, we expect the average
usage to go up, which will keep pressure on airlines to fly out of
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Massport can also order an airline to sublease a gate to a
competitor, which prevents airlines from being locked out of
Boston, Kinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we are not dominated by one airline, we can stay in
the driver's seat,'' Buckingham said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time, which Tito Puente could make throb, pulsate,
swivel, shake, exultate and finally, in the pounding rhythms of
mambo, cross over from the Barrio in Harlem to the Palladium in
midtown Manhattan and onto the airways of America, caught up with
the legendary band leader and percussionist late Wednesday night,
when he died at age 77.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered complications after open heart surgery at New York
University Medical Center, his manager, Eddie Rodriguez, said.
</P>
<P>
   The man known as El Rey, The king, who put Mambo on the map _
and who came to be nearly as much a symbol of New York City as
Yankee Stadium _ had been scheduled to perform at a benefit
Wednesday evening at Christie's Auction House.
</P>
<P>
   The most important Latin musician of the last half century and a
key figure in the fusion of Latin music with jazz, Puente was an
ebullient performer who often mugged and laughed as he whapped away
on his timbales.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else have I got to sell?'' he said a few months ago when
asked about this style. ``I'm not Ricky Martin, to wave my hips
around and show my belly button. I don't have a girl in front of
the band singing. I need the people to see I'm having a good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Known to the youngest of his fans as the man who wrote Carlos
Santana's hit ``Oye Como Va,''or perhaps from the 1992 movie ``The
Mambo Kings,'' in which he played himself, Puente had a career that
spanned five decades.
</P>
<P>
   There were few jazz stars from the be-bop era and beyond who did
not find him a compatible playing companion, and he was a staple of
the old Salsa Meets Jazz series at the Village Gate nightclub in
Manhattan and the JVC Jazz Festival, where he often stole the show
from more conventional jazz players.
</P>
<P>
   While many jazz groups added jazz sounds to Latin rhythms,
Puente liked to add a Latin rhythm section to a straight jazz
arrangement. A fine show-man, he was not beyond gimmicks like
recording Dave Brubeck's ``Take Five'' in four-four time. He was
also tireless ; even in recent years he worked between 200 and 300
performance a year.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Puente at the beginning of his career, bringing Latin
music to a new audience at the Palladium on Broadway at 53d Street,
that made many grow nostalgic Thursday at the news of Puente's
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave us all a life,'' said Robert Farris Thompson, a
professor at Yale University, where Puente had been awarded a Chubb
Fellowship earlier this year, ``And by us I mean not only Puerto
Ricans, but mainland blacks, huge numbers of Italian and Jews. We
all loved him. There were guys my age who were envious they weren't
at the Moulin Rouge in the days of Toulouse-Lautrec; who weren't at
Minton's in the days of the birth of bop. I was secure in the
knowledge that I had been there on the birth of New York mambo.''
</P>
<P>
   Puente's personal life was not tame. During World War II, on
leave, he married a longtime girlfriend, Mirta Sanchez. In 1947,
they had a son, Ronald. The marriage ended in divorce. Today, both
live in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, Puente had a long time relationship with Ida
Carlini, a dancer, now living in Miami, who says she met Puente at
The Palladium as a girl of 15. (``An Abby Lane type, gorgeous,''
one Palladium regular recalls.) Their son, Richard Anthony Puente,
was born in 1953. He became a musician.
</P>
<P>
   There followed a 30-year relationship with Puente's wife, the
former Margaret Acencio, with whom Puente had a son, Tito Puente,
Jr., a musician, and a daughter, Audrey Puente, a television
weather forecaster in New York. He and his wife were married,
Puente told the New York Times, ``four or five years'' ago, with
their 28-year-old son and 30-year-old daughter serving as their
parents' best man and best woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not taken a vacation in my whole life,'' Puente said in
that conversation, four months ago. ``Let me ask you a question:
Have you ever known a musician to take a vacation? You know when
you're on vacation? When the phone don't ring.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A musician who often said that he was ``born in rhythm,'',
Ernest Anthony Puente was born on April 20, 1923, at Harlem
Hospital and grew up on 110th Street, off Madison Avenue, in the
neighborhood then known as Spanish Harlem, or the Barrio. Both his
parents were immigrants from Puerto Rico; his father worked in a
razor blade factory; there was a younger sister and a younger
brother. Life was not easy: Tito's father, Puente said in an
interview in The New York Times last April, was a gambler, his
brother died at 4, in a fall from the fire escape.
</P>
<P>
   The young Tito was a drummer from the time he could remember,
drumming so loudly and so often, on the kitchen table, with pots
and pans, that the neighbors beseeched his mother to get her son
music lessons. She did, though to get the 25 cents a lesson she
needed, she had to go through her husband's pockets for money when
he was asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Tito studied piano, then drums, then timbales _ a rack-mounted
setup of drums, cowbell, woodblock and other percussion
instruments, which provide crisp upper-register rhythms for Latin
bands. He also toyed with the idea of becoming a dancer, performing
in the neighborhood with his sister, Anna, before either was in
their teens. They performed ballroom, acrobatic, tap, heavily
influence by the dance idols of the day, Fred Astaire and Gene
Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   But the music took precedence. Tito's big break came in the
'40s, when the United States entered the war. The drummer from the
Machito Orchestra, one of the first bands to fuse jazz and Latin
music, was drafted, and Tito took his place. At 13, Tito was a
professional. A few years later, Tito dropped out of high school;
the band, he would say years later, would provide schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Puente served in the Navy during World War II. He served in nine
battles, later receiving a presidential commendation.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Puente studied at the Juilliard School of Music
under the G.I. Bill. But the school's emphasis on classical music
made him restless. In 1948, he started his own band, the Piccadilly
Boys. Later, saying he did not want a band the name of which could
be confused with something on the menu ( picadillo is a meat and
potato hash), he changed the name to the Tito Puente Orchestra. His
early distinctive touch, putting percussion in front, happened by
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pretty boys were always in front, the percussion always in
the back,'' Puente said in an interview with The Toronto Star.
``But the frontman needed to get their rhythm cues from the
percussion and someone suggested putting the rhythm in front
instead. Now everyone does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Puente's first hit, Abaniquito, came one year later. By the
early '50s, the band had become the Tito Puente Orchestra and was
packing them in at New York's Palladium. Mambo was king and Tito
Puente was king of mambo, recording dance favorites such as
``Barbarabatiri.'' ``El Rey del Timbai'', and ``Mambo Gallego.'' In
the late '50s, Puente was fusing cha-cha _ the hot Latin cross-over
dance of the Catskills _ with big band compositions.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, Puente began to collaborate with other New York
musicians, including Celia Cruz, who would become the Queen of
Latin Music to his King, with trombonist Buddy Morrow, with Woody
Herman. In 1963 he recorded ``Oye Como Va'' which 12 years later
would be a hit song for Carlos Santana, and still later, a running
joke with Puente, who often publicly thanked Santana for his
royalties. In 1968, Puente had his own television show, on Hispanic
television, ``The World of Tito Puente.''
</P>
<P>
   The '70s were a down time for Puente.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a boogaloo era, and there were some other
non-musical fads, and he had to do things to keep up with the Jones
that were not so good for his records,'' said Johnny Rodriguez,
Puente's long time road manager. But in the '80s, and particularly
in the '90s, he was coming back. He recorded with jazz musicians
Phil Woods, George Shearing, James Moody, Dave Valentin, Hilton
Ruiz and Terry Gibbs; he and his band often performed with symphony
orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   He also became a sort of symbol of the New York Puerto Rican
identity, marching prominently in Puerto Rican parades. In 1995,
Puente opened a popular 250-seat restaurant on City Island, the
maritime enclave just across from the Bronx. It featured a
Caribbean-Hispanic menu with Puerto Rican specialties and, of
course, Latin jazz.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, President Clinton recalled his remarks
when he gave Puente the National Medal of Arts in 1997. ``Just
hearing Tito Puente's name makes you want to get up and dance,''
Clinton said then.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar Hijuelos novel, ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of
Love,'' which became a film in 1992, ``The Mambo Kings,'', offered
sweet vindication. In that story two Cuban brothers move to New
York in the '50s and form a mambo band; Puente is portrayed as the
king, the center of the mambo universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought playing in those place, writing that music,
experiencing it all, that there would be a movie of it,'' Puente
said in The Times. ``It's a place and time that has really been
overlooked. So this now comes out and I feel good about it. This
will help get out music around the world.''

ANDRE AGASSI OUSTED FROM FRENCH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In an earlier time, a king of France named Louis XVI was
rather harshly removed from his title _ with a guillotine at the
Place de la Concorde. That was 1793.
</P>
<P>
   The blow was a little softer _ but maybe as painful _ for King
Andre I of the House of Agassi on Thursday. It was delivered by a
Slovak commoner called Kucera, who separated Andre from his French
crown with a gut-strung blade, a tennis racket wielded with utmost
sharpness and severity as the assembled public gasped.
</P>
<P>
   Andre would have been better off at the Place de la Concorde, a
broad plaza of merriment from which the guillotine has been removed
and handsome fountains now play while a gigantic Ferris wheel
spins. But surely the suddenly ex-ruler of these red courts felt
soaked, his head spinning, as he trudged away from Stade Roland
Garros, beaten by strapping 6-foot-2-inch Karol Kucera, 2-6, 7-5,
6-1, 6-0, in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The second round? Pretty early for a major tournament to fall
apart. But late in the afternoon, as the sun finally made other
than a fleeting appearance at this French Open, this day was marked
as Black Thursday. Both the king and queen of tennis, in the pop
view anyway _ Agassi and Anna Kournikova _ were gone. Dispatched
from the scene as certainly as Louis XVI and his roommate, Marie
Antoinette.
</P>
<P>
   Thud. Thud. What a devastating pair of falls.
</P>
<P>
   You see, preceding Andre to the scrap heap was Anna, the goddess
of camera pointers and marketers, the resident of such diverse
magazine covers as Forbes and currently Sports Illustrated. It was
downhill from the start as No. 35 Sylvia Plischke, from a skiing
mecca, Innsbruck, Austria, schussed past her, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova, the Russian who turns 19 in five days, may win ogles
and endorsement contracts _ never titles. Agassi, having sprung
from the same Nick Bollettieri nursery in Bradenton, Fla., is quite
a different character, a champion of all-time quality _ although he
can show a similar prima dona temperament. Unlike Louis XVI, Andre
I could run away and hide as he did Thursday, unwilling to discuss
his debacle. He thus incurred a $10,000 fine, the sort of chump
change he hands out to footmen.
</P>
<P>
   As Kucera said, ``Andre's got the match in his hands in the
second set, but I was lucky to get back. Then I got into it, and
the match was open. I got confident, started to hit. But my name is
still a little bit small.''
</P>
<P>
   Not altogether. A dangerous guy though ranked No. 60, Kucera two
years ago beat Pete Sampras in the quarters at the Australian and
Agassi in the fourth round at the US Open. He incurred an
astounding loss to Paradorn Srichaphan, the pride of Thailand, at
the Australian in January, but has been slowly pulling himself
together since.
</P>
<P>
   Did it all turn on the big name's big toe? Andre and his
entourage of girlfriend Steffi Graf, coach Brad Gilbert, and
trainer Gil Reyes, rearranged their lengthening faces and vanished
so fast that the unanswered question will soon become stale.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it was all Andre up to 6-2, 5-4, as he went to the
baseline to serve for a two-set lead. He had also been up a break
earlier in the set, but seemed a touch complacent _ cavalier and
overly sure?
</P>
<P>
   He didn't press hard enough to nail down a two-set lead _ and
the unraveling began, during which he won one _ that's one _ more
game, and lost the last 11, from 1-1 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, the saga of the big toe. At 1-4 to the rear in the
third set, Agassi called an injury timeout. Trainer Per Bastholt
appeared to treat a blister on the lead piggie of the king's right
foot and shave a callous that was pressuring the blister. Andre
made grim faces, but returned to battle, seeming unimpaired. But
something was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Kucera could smell it, and let loose with self-assured, booming
groundies. Clearly Andre was no longer the champ, and it was only a
matter of minutes, and the 12 points he could scrape together,
before it became official.
</P>
<P>
   The king was dead, and 15,166 unbelieving subjects groaned, then
applauded as he waved goodbye. Two other defending champs had been
cut off in the second round (Andres Gimeno by Guillermo Vilas in
1973; Guga Kuerten by Marat Safin in 1998), but none was marched
off shackled in a bagel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen out there that you need to get by,'' Andre had
mused as the tourney began. They happened; he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he graced Court Central was the occasion of
Andre's 1999 coronation. The throng hailed him boisterously for his
revival from two sets deep, behind Andrei Medvedev, to ascend the
throne and become merely the fifth in history to have worn all four
major crowns.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was evicted in the first round along with Todd Martin,
Andre in the second. Jim Courier and MaliVai Washington are looking
for rest homes. The male American Iron Age is rusting, with only
the little king of 1989, Michael Chang, still standing here, if
unsteadily.
</P>
<P>
   Kings can hurt, too, but, all in all, Andre I's treatment in
Paris was somewhat better than Louis XVI's.

NASDAQ SURGES TO 5.3 PERCENT GAIN 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks roared ahead Thursday, propelling
the Nasdaq composite index to its seventh-best gain in percentage
terms, up 5.3 percent. That performance followed Tuesday's record
7.9 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
   The index surged 181.59 points, to 3,582.50, and cut the
Nasdaq's losses on the year to nearly 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's downturn, investors became re-enthused
Thursday as the economic news of the day suggested that the economy
was slowing markedly from the breakneck pace that had led the
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates six times since last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to see the impact'' of the slow-acting but
powerful antiinflation medicine being used by Alan Greenspan, the
Fed's chairman, said Frank Cappiello of McCullough, Andrews &AMP;
Cappiello in Baltimore. ``We sense that he's gotten near the end of
raising rates. And if that's the case, then these tech stocks are
woefully underpriced.''
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor 500 stocks also posted a gain, up 28.21
points, or 2 percent, to 1,448.81, while the Dow Jones industrial
average climbed 129.97 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,652.20.
</P>
<P>
   News of slackened industrial costs and construction spending
still left many analysts unpersuaded that rate increases are near
an end and that this spring's stock slide is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm skeptical,'' said Byron R. Wien, chief U.S. strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He said the economic slowing was from a
``very feverish'' pace, suggesting that more Fed tightening might
be needed, and that in any event corporate earnings growth was
probably on the wane. ``I would certainly have a defensive
position'' toward stocks, Wien advised.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Robert M. Balentine, chief executive of the
investment counselors Balentine &AMP; Co., took a similar view. ``We're
simply seeing some bounce off the lows,'' he said. ``We would use
the rally to raise cash for better buying opportunities ahead
rather than think the worst is behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the skeptics cited continued subdued trading volume as
evidence that the rally lacked enthusiasm, there had been a clear
improvement lately in the proportion of stocks moving higher.
Thursday, 2,061 New York Stock Exchange issues advanced while 927
declined, and new 52-week highs nearly doubled new lows, 68 to 35.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio was even better for the S&AMP;P 500, where 353 stocks rose
while 131 declined and 16 were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Several Nasdaq issues posted double-digit gains, with the
heavily weighted Cisco Systems, up 4, to 60 15/16, having the
biggest impact.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, up 14 1/16, to 134\, after a meeting that
impressed security analysts, accounted for nearly two-thirds of the
Dow's rise. Intel climbed 5, to 129 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Although the market for initial public offerings has been
severely chilled of late, ONI Systems, a fiber optics company,
attracted huge demand for 8 million shares it offered late Tuesday
at 25. The stock started trading Thursday at 75, climbed as high as
86 and finished at 82 9/16.

GLENN HOPEFUL ON CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHPEE, Mass. _ On a blissful spring day at Willowbend Country
Club, Terry Glenn, playing the part of celebrity golfer _clad in
yellow-striped polo shirt and straw hat _ said his contract
situation will not get the best of him or his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Though preferring to sign a new deal, Glenn, who has two years
remaining on a six-year pact, said he won't be a holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hold out, but I feel I would be doing my teammates a
bad deal,'' Glenn said. ``They want to win as much as I want to
win. I feel Drew (Bledsoe) basically came in with me because when I
came in we clicked and we started winning. So he's on the same
wavelength. I'd be doing them an injustice to hold out.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn watched as Marvin Harrison (4 years, $24 million) and
Keyshawn Johnson (8 years, $56 million) signed huge deals with
Indianapolis and Tampa Bay, respectively. Both are Pro Bowlers, a
select club that Glenn joined last season, but when Glenn asked for
a new deal after the season, the Patriots told him to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will earn $2.4 million this year and about the same next
year, but compared with the $6 million-plus Harrison and Johnson
will earn, Glenn, who is not even the highest-paid receiver on his
own team, appears well behind his 1996 first-round classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have no choice, then I have no choice,'' said Glenn. ``If
I have a choice, then I wouldn't want to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has been a part of most of the offseason conditioning
program, but recently returned to his home in Columbus to work out
at Ohio State with his former strength coach, Dave Kennedy. He has
spent time working directly with Bledsoe and remains excited about
the prospects of the new offense under offensive coodinator Charlie
Weis, who has gone back to the system (with a few new wrinkles) in
which Glenn thrived (90 receptions in 1996).
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt ever since I heard (Bill) Belichick and Weis got the
job, I gave my friends a high-five because it's what I wanted,''
said Glenn. ``We went to a Super Bowl with that offense. There are
a couple of other things we need to put into the offense, but we're
looking good.''
</P>
<P>
   With Ben Coates gone, it appears Glenn will have to carry even
more of the burden, which he embraces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited every year as far as getting ready with my
teammates,'' he said. ``I would love to go back to the Pro Bowl,
but I'm going to set my sights on more team goals. I'd rather go to
the Super Bowl than the Pro Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas doesn't volunteer
</P>
<P>
   Henry Thomas surfaced at Thursday's tournament after skipping
the team's ``voluntary'' minicamp Tuesday and Wednesday. He was the
only veteran not in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he didn't attend because ``it's voluntary.'' Thomas
thinks after 13 years he should be cut some slack, and that may be
the case. The Patriots need Thomas's leadership, not to mention his
ability as a defensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas spent the offseason working out in Houston. He will take
part in Friday's mandatory minicamp, which runs through the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't call Belichick, Thomas said: ``Why should I?
So it's disrespectful not to call? I didn't mean it to be
disrespectful. I wanted to be home with my family in Houston
because that's where I live.''

FLEXIBILITY ON NATURE IS NEEDED, BUSH SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAND HARBOR NATIONAL PARK, Nev. _ Gov. George W. Bush criticized
the Clinton-Gore administration on Thursday for an approach to land
conservation that he said involved too much federal muscle and too
little local flexibility. Instead, he proposed using federal
resources and incentives to coax state governments and private
citizens into greater conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Against a carefully chosen backdrop of snow-crowned mountains,
gargantuan pine trees and the astonishingly blue waters of Lake
Tahoe, the Texas governor presented his plan as an illustration of
what he said was his deep commitment to preserving natural
splendors like the one he was visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed spending a modest amount of money, calling for an
additional $2.3 billion in federal spending on conservation efforts
over the next five years. But he emphasized that much of that money
would be channeled to local governments or used for programs that
would encourage private landowners and private groups to take a
more aggressive stewardship of the land and water around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a national consensus about the importance of
conservation, but critical problems arise when leaders reject
partnership, when they rely solely on the power of Washington and
the regulations and penalties and dictation from afar,'' Bush told
scores of local residents who gathered here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' he said, ``this is exactly what we have seen
for the last seven years. We've seen millions of acres of land
declared off limits and designated as national monuments just like
that, with no real public involvement, no regard for the people
affected by these decrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the proposal he made on Thursday would help remedy
that. It called for an increase in the annual allocation of money
for the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund to $900 million
from its current level of $500 million. That represented an
additional investment of $2 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would set aside half of that money for state and local
conservation efforts. Bush also proposed tax incentives for private
landowners to sell their property to conservation groups and
estimated that the lost federal revenue from the measure would be
about $300 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's speech followed, by only three days, a major address
on conservation by Vice President Al Gore, in which Gore promised
to prohibit logging and road building on 43 million acres of
undeveloped national forests. It was a pledge that went beyond the
currently stated intentions of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not mention or criticize that proposal specifically,
but his remarks suggested that he would be much more reluctant than
Gore to use federal power to declare wilderness areas off limits
without the support and cooperation of the people who used and
lived near them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech on Thursday was his second this year on
environmental issues, which the Gore campaign sees as one of the
governor's prime vulnerabilities. By several important measures of
environmental health, Texas ranks near or at the bottom of the 50
states, although Bush's aides say the situation has been improving
steadily over the five years that he has been governor.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Bush's remarks on Thursday, several environmental
advocates expressed concern that his approach would be too
permissive and hands-off and that the results would be the
endangering of pristine land and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people want a clean and safe environment, and it
sounds like George Bush said today he would not use the tools
available to give it to them,'' said Dan Weiss, the political
director of the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, rejected
Bush's implicit portrayal of the vice president as someone without
concern for local sentiments when it came to protecting land and
water, and said Gore believed strongly in working with local
residents on conservation efforts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With his proposal on Thursday, Bush was doing more than simply
asserting concern about conservation. He was again casting the
November presidential election as a contest between the view that
Washington has the best solutions and the belief that people
outside of Washington do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow,'' Bush said, ``the mentality of Washington is: `We
know better. We know better than the citizens of this great state.
Let us think on behalf of the citizens,' goes the thinking. It's
time to have new thinking in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   As an illustration of that thinking, Bush said he wanted to
devote $50 million annually from the land conservation fund to
provide matching funds for states that develop programs to give
private landowners assistance for conservation efforts.

BLAZERS HAVE TALENT IN RESERVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ The All-NBA teams came out this week. The
Lakers had a first-team selection (Shaquille O'Neal) and a
second-teamer (Kobe Bryant). The Blazers, who were the second-best
team in the NBA this season, have one of the 50 greatest players of
all time in Scottie Pippen, more than a few All-Star Game
performers, and yet placed no one in the top 25.
</P>
<P>
   All season long, the Blazers have touted their depth more than
their individual stars. It helped them win games, if not accolades
for their players. And it helped send this whacky Western
Conference final series back here for a sixth game Friday night
against the Lakers at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In the first five games, the vaunted Portland bench was getting
outplayed by such luminaries as Rick Fox, Derek Fisher, and Robert
Horry. The Lakers grabbed a 3-1 lead with two insulting wins here
in Games 3 and 4. It got so bad in Game 4 that Trail Blazers coach
Mike Dunleavy kept Detlef Schrempf on the pine for the full 48 and
used backup point guard Greg Anthony for just four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blazers' dense pack was back in business for Game 5
Tuesday at the Staples Center. Schrempf was exhumed and played 27
valuable minutes, collecting a game-high six assists. Brian Grant,
who has been sacrificing his body to play out of position as a
backup center most of this series, was heroic in 23 minutes. No one
moped about not playing (Schrempf, Anthony) or having to play out
of position against a behemoth (Grant).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called professionalism,'' Dunleavy said. ``When you put
the time in and prepare yourself and when you're called and you
step up and do the job. We're fortunate to have guys who do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Blazer Ball, as it was conceived by general manager Bob
Whitsitt (with a big assist from owner Paul Allen's bankroll)
before the season started and was developed as the season
progressed. To an already imposing mix, Whitsitt added Schrempf,
Pippen, and Steve Smith and Portland chased the Lakers for the
first four months of the season before falling off. They're still
chasing them, but they also are still alive, to the surprise of
many after the Memorial Day weekend performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a situation where we had the veteran guys who were
focused on winning a championship, so we knew we could cut their
minutes and develop the young guys along the way,'' Whitsitt said
Thursday. ``We thought we'd have a real professional team and have
great chemistry, which we've had. But this is a tough league. You
really don't know what you get until you get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant has been the embodiment of team sacrifice, especially in
this series. With the arrival of Pippen, he quickly went from
starter to reserve. That was an adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   And with Portland's still mind-boggling decision not to activate
Joe Kleine (in favor of the never-used and never-will-be-used Gary
Grant), that has meant the undersized Brian Grant has had to go
eye-to-sternum with O'Neal when Arvydas Sabonis gets into foul
trouble, which is always.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take a page from Charlie Ward's book and Detlef
Schrempf's book. I'm a bench player this year,'' Grant said. ``I've
had to get used to being a bench player. Here, towards the end, you
just realize that you have to be ready, no matter when you go in.
It would have been very easy for me to get upset that I didn't go
in the whole first quarter and for half the second. But I just
stayed positive, went out there, and was able to hit some big shots
and give the team a lift.''
</P>
<P>
   So many times, it's the ``other guys'' who help determine the
outcome of a series. The Blazers are more than willing to let Ron
Harper, A.C. Green, or the aforementioned reserves beat them. They
even gave the usually reliable Glen Rice some easy looks in Game 5
and lived to tell about it.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen led the charge in Game 5 and hopes to do the same Friday
night. Bryant, who missed practice Thursday because of a sprained
right foot, is hoping to bounce back from a disastrous performance
and already is feeling the heat of Phil Jackson's deftly probing
needle. Bryant usually bounces back.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers will again rely on their reserves to tip the
balance. That's the way it has been and that's the way it will
continue to be.

`SURVIVOR' RATINGS GIVE ANOTHER BOOST TO VOYEURISTIC TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Ratings graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last summer, ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' turned the
television world on its head by defying every expectation and
seizing huge audiences, eventually catapulting ABC to overall
network ratings leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new summer series, about a group of people forced to live
together in primitive circumstances on an island off Borneo, has
gotten off to a similarly stunning start, and television executives
are already wondering whether it can do the same thing for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor,'' CBS's experiment in mixing ``Lord of the Flies,''
with ``Gilligan's Island'' and ``Treasure Island,'' came out of the
gate roaring Wednesday night, pulling in 15.5 million viewers, a
figure that dwarfed any show CBS has used on a Wednesday night in
two years _ during the regular TV season, never mind the summer. In
a reverse for CBS, the network with the oldest audience, the show
drew a surprising number of young viewers, providing a glimpse of
the marketing clout of a combined CBS and Viacom Inc., with its
youth oriented radio and cable stations, like MTV and VH-1.
</P>
<P>
   The early success could be due to that promotional push. Even
CBS executives will not predict how well the ratings will hold up.
But the initial success is likely to intensify the market for
programs that record real people doing real-life things. Indeed,
networks were said to be lining up Thursday to acquire the rights
to similar televoyeur shows, including one set on a bus, one set in
a futuristic house supposedly on another planet, and one in which
an actor tries to sabotage his teammates in a series of contests.
</P>
<P>
   CBS itself is set to capitalize immediately with the debut next
month of ``Big Brother,'' possibly the most elaborate effort in the
movement toward voyeuristic shows, in which 10 people spend three
months together in a house, with their every movement recorded live
on camera.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The initial ratings for ``Survivor,'' huge by summer standards,
can only feed the trend. The show proved to be more than
competitive with ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' which ABC
scheduled at the last minute to try to hold down the audience for
``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC did edge `'Survivor'' in one respect; it attracted more
overall, viewers, 16.8 million viewers. But ``Survivor's'' most
noticeable feat was the number of young viewers it brought in to
CBS. ``Survivor'' not only beat ``Millionaire'' in every category
of young viewers, from teen-agers through adults between the ages
of 18 and 49, and 25 and 54; it also managed to triple CBS's
average prime-time audience among viewers between the ages of 18
and 34.
</P>
<P>
   That achievement shocked a number of CBS's competitors. An
executive with one competing network said, ``Those are simply
incredible numbers for CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, called the
ratings ``a great corporate victory,'' saying ``We had people doing
interviews everywhere, on radio on VH-1 on MTV,''
</P>
<P>
   The show stirred so much interest that Moonves decided to
schedule a repeat broadcast of the first episode, Saturday night at
10.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of the 13 scheduled ``Survivor'' episodes, two
teams of eight people each, carefully cast to include a wide range
of ages, ethnic groups and personalities, were thrown together on
the island of Pulau Tiga, where they had to do everything from
build latrines to forage for food to create a fire.
</P>
<P>
   They were also bitten by bugs, harassed by rats (which viewers
have been promised they will later see these folks eat for dinner),
and challenged by a raft-racing task with the reward of some
waterproof matches. The losing team had to vote one person off the
island. (Each show ends with someone's ignominious departure.)
</P>
<P>
   Because she fell and cost her team a victory in the raft race, a
62-year-old woman named Sonja was the first victim of the show's
Darwinian ethos.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Survivor's'' instant ascent to event status provided
some solace for Sonja, who was interviewed all over television
Thursday, from CBS's own ``Early Show'' (which, every Thursday for
the next 13 weeks, has first claim on everyone bounced from the
island), to MSNBC, Fox News, and even ``The Daily Show'' on Comedy
Central.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as busy as Sonja Thursday was Ben Silverman, an agent
with the William Morris Agency, who spent four years in Europe, and
was an early advocate of the European reality shows, whose formats
are now making their way into the United States. Silverman had a
hand in bringing ``Millionaire'' to ABC and was involved in the
heated negotiations for ``Big Brother,'' in which CBS outbid ABC by
putting up a reported $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratings for `Survivor' have put the networks into
overdrive for other formats,'' Silverman said. ``Right now CBS and
ABC are the most involved.'' He said he expected several shows he
represents to be sold shortly.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   These include ``The Bus,'' which examines ordinary people on a
bus tour and ``The Mole,'' the one in which an actor
surreptitiously plays havoc with contestants in a series of scenic
challenges like bungee jumps.
</P>
<P>
   Another show sets up a house as though it in on some outer-space
colony in a distant future. Silverman said he also represents
several other shows in the genre that he could not yet reveal.
</P>
<P>
   What all the shows have in common, beyond their initial success
in European countries, from Great Britain to Holland to Belgium, is
their use of real people interacting on camera. Most of the shows
also have extensive Internet components, where fans can follow the
progress of the contestants even when the show is not on the air.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   How real these ``reality shows'' actually are has been
questioned, but Mark Burnett the executive producer of
``Survivor,'' said Thursday: ``It is exactly real. I refuse for any
reason to manipulate what really happens. These people are on
camera, and they say what they say, but I'm not going to manipulate
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The rats, he said, are real and ever present on the island. The
snakes, he said, are real and truly dangerous, enough so that he
made sure that anyone bitten could be evacuated by helicopter to a
hospital within 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett argued that the events are in no way staged or re-edited
to build drama. Each show represents three days of taping on the
island. Each ends with one member voted out until a winner is
selected, and takes home the $1 million prize.
</P>
<P>
   But Burnett said he does edit the show to set up future plot
lines, as he did in the first episode, which showed a brief shot of
one contestant reading his Bible. ``We are setting that up, because
clearly religion does become a factor. Some people don't like being
preached to, particularly on an island where you can't get off.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said he was being cautious about the show's initial
ratings success. ``I don't want to declare victory after one
episode.'' But he acknowledged that ``the show has tremendous
economic upside.'' That upside cannot be exploited in the current
slate of shows, no matter how big the ratings get, because all of
them were sold out to eight full sponsors, which include Reebok,
Bud Lite beer and the U.S Army.
</P>
<P>
   But Moonves said, ``The advertisers saw those ratings and and
got phenomenally jacked.'' This was especially because of those
exceptional numbers among younger viewers.
</P>
<P>
   If that keeps up, CBS can expect to sell its commercials in
``Big Brother'' for even higher prices, as well as those for future
editions of ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   And there will almost certainly be future editions. Moonves said
he was not yet ready to start up the process of picking another
group of people to be isolated in another exotic locale, though the
mechanism is already in place to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said ``I don't think we'll go back to an island, but we
may go some place like Africa or the Andes or the Australian
outback.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The decision to order another ``Survivor'' adventure series may
not take much longer. ``We could have another `Survivor' ready by
January,'' Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   That would again parallel ``Millionaire,'' which ABC brought
back quickly after its summer success, installing it first as a two
week event in November, a rating sweep month.
</P>
<P>
   January is not a sweep month, but February is _ and the
``Survivor'' format calls for 13 weeks of shows. ``If it works well
in January, it will work well in February,'' Moonves said.

 &HT;    Miami reaction muted
 &HT;    By Alexandra Navarro Clifton and Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _Reaction to Thursday's federal apeals court ruling in the
Elian Gonzalez case spurred a small but vocal demonstration in
Miami's Little Havana neighborhood outside the small house where
Elian had stayed with his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people gathered outside the house to express their
anguish _ some falling to the ground sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   The fence around the house is still adorned with home-made
posters showing Elian with his mother, written diatribes against
Bill Clinton and Janet Reno, prayers and American and Cuban flags.
Small groups stood around portable radios listening to Cuban
commentators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought this could happen in this country,'' said Ana
Alfonso. ``Give the child an opportunity to speak. Children running
away from communism have always been welcomed here.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami police also gathered, waiting and watching at both ends of
the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect any trouble,'' Lt. Bill Schwartz said. ``We
are prepared to deal with any violence or unrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban activist Ramon Saul Sanchez said his group plans a
Flotilla to Communist Island in about three weeks. He said the
group would leave from Miami Marine Stadium and stop in
international waters 12 miles off the coast of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to bring awareness to the American people and the
international community that Cuba has been a divided country for
the last 40 years because of one man _ Fidel Castro,'' Saul Sanchez
said. ``We need to bring down those barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ana Bonnin was adjusting the yellow ribbons and flowers
supporters of the family have left on the fence in front of the
house. She has been outside the small home since January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very betrayed,'' Bonnin said. ``Where are the rights of
the mother who died for that child to be free?''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd _ small compared to the one that swelled to hundreds
the day federal marshals snatched the boy from the home April 22 _
directed their anger alternately to Clinton, Reno and the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a family issue, it is a humanitarian issue'' said
Everalso Buznejo, a Hialeah man who said his daughter drowned in
1992 trying to get to the United States in a homemade raft. ``This
child isn't being sent back to his father, he's being sent back to
the Cuban government.''
</P>
<P>
   A small number promised violence if the 6-year-old boy is sent
back to the communist nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hell with being peaceful _ we have been peaceful long
enough,'' said Daniel Jimenez, a 23-year-old unemployed dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans in West Palm Beach, who protested in large
numbers when Elian was seized by federal agents, took the latest
setback quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, the ruling was expected,'' said Jorge
Avellana, who helped organize past protests. ``It's not the end.
Now we will wait to see what the Supreme Court has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Cristobal Oviedo, an activist in the Cuban-American community in
West Palm Beach, said he's disappointed the Clinton administration
has not allowed the Miami relatives to visit Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court doesn't play games and I'll accept whatever the
court decides,'' he said. ``But Clinton is on the side of the
father and Castro.''

   Tito Puente recorded some 120 albums over more than 50 years.
Here is a selection of some of his best work, including his vital
dance music.
</P>
<P>

music at the highest possible level, with Santitos Colon singing.
</P>
<P>
   TOP PERCUSSION (RCA). A trip into Afro-Cuban religious and
secular music, using mostly percussion.
</P>
<P>
   MAMBORAMA (Tico). An instrumental album of mambos from 1959,
with Puente playing vibraphone and showing off some of his more
modern jazz arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   VAYA PUENTE (Tico). Tough dance music from 1962.
</P>
<P>
   TITO PUENTE SINGS THE EXCITING LA LUPE SWINGS (Tico). Rocking
early salsa with one of the better singers of the time.
</P>
<P>
   HOMENAJE A BENY (Tico). A three-CD set recorded in the late
1970s, featuring a series of salsa's best singers, including Celia
Cruz, Hector Lavoe and Adalberto Santiago performing the music of
Beny More.

dance album that reflects Puente's band-leading precision; it won a
Grammy.

TIME TO SILENCE JEALOUS PORTLAND FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; PORTLAND, Ore.  &UR; _ &LR;  To the team with the most composure will go
the Western Conference Finals crown. And if the Los AngelesLakers
can dispose of the Portland Trail Blazers tonight in six games,
well, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we can hear the reddish-black jackals now, howling about how
the Lakers were the ones whose stiff upper lip went slack Tuesday.
Staring at a gilded invitation to close out Portland on their home
court, the Lakers did blink, we'll (Gary) grant the Trail Blazers
that.
</P>
<P>
   Losing one's repose in a hail of turnovers and 3-pointers is one
thing. That's easily remedied. As Kobe Bryant commented in the wake
of the Lakers' 96-88 loss in Game 5: ``You just throw it out and
you just move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had a wide-open shot at the NBA Finals and clanked it
off the rim. Hey, even a pure shooter such as Glen Rice misses an
uncontested jumper every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers didn't lose their nerve, just their instinct. Instead
of acting reflexively, they found themselves ``just thinking about
the chance to go the finals after beating a good team,'' reserve
guard Derek Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing the Lakers knew, their muscles were tighter than the
Laker Girls' second skins.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some extra anxiety,'' Fisher conceded, ``some extra
tension that really hadn't been there in this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes in the lotus position, a few big Brahma breaths and
the Lakers will be fine. There's nothing wrong with them that a
couple of relaxation exercises can't fix.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers flexed their resilience, coming back from a
15-point loss in the series opener to win Game 2 and staving off
elimination in Game 5. In this case, the power to snap back is not
to be confused with strength of character.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson was being kind when he called the
Trail Blazers jackals after they woofed at the Lakers in the waning
moments of their 106-77 Game 2 win.
</P>
<P>
   If we were a jackal, we'd be indignant. Jackals, because they
feast on decaying flesh, have a bad smell. That much at least is
consistent with the whiff we've gotten from the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland players reek of crassness. They're not just fouling
Shaquille O'Neal on every possession, they're fouling the whole
competitive arena.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a killer instinct they've bared in this series. No,
what has been on display is the death of decency.
</P>
<P>
   With less than three minutes remaining in the second quarter of
Game 3 in Portland and the Trail Blazers ahead by nine points,
forward Rasheed Wallace blocked a shot by Ron Harper and started
taunting the Lakers' 14-year veteran. No surprise there; in
Wallace's world, the bait-and-switch is a basketball play, not a
sales technique.
</P>
<P>
   The shocker was Wallace chose to taunt Harper, a recovering
stutterer, about his speech impediment. That kind of meanness most
of us outgrow along with our Superheroes underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, 25, is old enough to know the difference between
trash-talking and talking trashy.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the bench is where the Trail Blazers are deep.
Nobody ever said anything about their emotional balance.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minute of Game 4, Scottie Pippen, who's supposed to
be blazing the trail for Portland, planted his elbow in the back of
John Salley's head. Pippen didn't draw a foul for his
unsportsmanlike act, though he later was fined $10,000 by the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen ought to have been suspended for Game 5; instead, he
emerged as its star, getting 22 points, seven rebounds, six steals,
four blocked shots and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Injustice won that game, but we're counting on justness
prevailing in the best-of-seven series. It'd be agreeably apropos
if the Lakers were to extinguish the Trail Blazers' season tonight
at the Rose Garden given that the fans here tend not to act any
more civilized than their favorite Portland players.
</P>
<P>
   They acknowledged the presence at the games last weekend of
actress-slash-director-slash Lakers fan Penny Marshall by booing
her lustily. They jeered a Jack Nicholson look-alike, then cheered
when he was made over to resemble a rabid Portland fan.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland fans really need to get over their Tinseltown envy.
It's not at all becoming.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers might have lost a little composure in Game 5, but
that's easily found. Somewhere along the way, the city of Portland
and its basketball stars seem to have replaced something that's
irretrievable: their class.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Five and a half years and 131 executions after
he took office, Gov. George W. Bush for the first time on Thursday
found a death penalty case in which he agreed that the condemned
convict was worthy of a 30-day stay.
</P>
<P>
   Working from out of state through an acting governor _ and in
the midst of a presidential campaign that has put a spotlight on
Texas' busiest-in-the-nation execution chamber _ Bush gave Ricky
Nolen McGinn 30 days to get the DNA testing that McGinn claims will
clear him in the 1993 rape and ax slaying of his 12-year-old
stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The reprieve was officially granted 18 minutes prior to McGinn's
scheduled 6 p.m. execution. It was ordered despite the U.S. Supreme
Court's Thursday refusal to delay the execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time DNA evidence, in the context of all the evidence, is
deemed to be relevant in the guilt or innocence of a person on
death row, we need to use it,'' Bush said on the presidential
campaign trail in Sacramento. ``I expect the court and all relevant
parties to act expeditiously to review the evidence and finally
determine his innocence or guilt as to the charge of rape.''
</P>
<P>
   In Huntsville, McGinn, suddenly a bit player in a presidential
campaign, said, ``Thank you for the chance. It came so close,''
according to prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they'll see what I've been telling them all these
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown County District Attorney Lee Haney, who prosecuted the
Brownwood case, on Thursday dropped his opposition to new DNA
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do what we can to cooperate,'' he said before
the reprieve was granted. ``We're respecting the governor's
decision if in fact it turns out to be his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday, when the decision was announced, Haney said, ``I
have mixed emotions about it from the standpoint of the family who
was sitting there in Huntsville waiting for this to happen,''
</P>
<P>
   The DNA testing can determine if McGinn is guilty of the rape, a
charge that is crucial to the case. Under Texas law, a death
penalty can only be ordered in a murder case that also involves
another crime, such as robbery, rape or kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   The reprieve was formally signed by Sen. Rodney Ellis,
D-Houston, serving as acting governor in the absence of Bush and
Lt. Gov. Rick Perry. Bush was campaigning Thursday in Nevada and
California. Perry is vacationing in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said he agreed with Bush that the 30-day reprieve was
necessary. He said Bush would have had time to return to the state
and issue a ruling if the two had differed.
</P>
<P>
   The reprieve proclamation signed by Ellis noted that he acted
``upon the advice and recommendation of'' Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout this process, I have been in close contact with the
governor's office and we agree that a reprieve is necessary in this
case,'' said Ellis, a death penalty supporter but longtime critic
of the way Texas provides attorneys to indigent defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth lawyer Richard Alley, representing McGinn, said the
late-breaking reprieve made for a ``pretty tense'' afternoon. He
said he expects all parties to work together to make sure the DNA
testing happens as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Though the reprieve expires after 30 days, state District Judge
Steven Ellis, whose previous recommendation for new DNA testing was
rejected Tuesday by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, retains
the authority to reset the execution date if more time is needed
for the tests.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time reprieve is the only action a Texas governor can
take without a recommendation from the Texas Board of Pardons and
Paroles. McGinn was granted the stay despite the fact that the
board voted 11-7 on Wednesday against it.
</P>
<P>
   The last 30-day reprieve was granted by then-Gov. Ann Richards
to Gary Graham in 1993, who maintained he was wrongfully convicted
in a Houston murder. Graham is still on death row.
</P>
<P>
   At McGinn's 1995 trial, which ended with jurors taking only 40
minutes to recommend the death sentence, three women testified they
had been sexually assaulted by McGinn. Brownwood law enforcement
officials say DNA evidence directly linked McGinn to the 1992
murder of a 19-year-old woman. That case was never prosecuted
because McGinn already was on death row.
</P>
<P>
   DNA evidence was admitted at the trial, but his lawyers now
believe more-advanced testing could clear him. On Wednesday, Bush
pardoned a Tyler man who had served 17 years in prison for a rape
that DNA testing now shows he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, executions have become so commonplace they draw little
attention. Since 1982, the state has killed 218 people, more than a
third of the executions carried out since the Supreme Court cleared
the way for the resumption of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huntsville executions have drawn closer scrutiny in
recent months as Bush sewed up the GOP presidential nomination and
questions arose about the possible innocence of death row inmates
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, Republican Gov. George Ryan placed a moratorium on
executions in January. In New Hampshire, lawmakers last week voted
to abolish the death penalty. The measure faces a promised veto
from Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his campaign, Bush has insisted he has no doubt about
the guilt of those executed since he took office. The governor has
commuted only one death sentence _ that of Henry Lee Lucas _
because Bush believed there was doubt about some of the evidence in
that Williamson County case.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic consultant Paul Begala, who worked for then-Gov. Bill
Clinton during his 1992 presidential campaign, said Thursday that
Bush's move could soften the ``emerging Bush image of a rather
callous approach to the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning Thursday in Atlanta, Vice President Al Gore, Bush's
November foe, declined to accuse Bush of playing politics with the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the facts of the Texas case, but I think that DNA
and DNA testing is a valuable new tool that can provide new
evidence in a lot of cases,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore did not attempt to politicize the McGinn case, Mike
Lawrence, associate director of the Public Policy Institute at
Southern Illinois University, said Bush's move could have some
impact on the White House race, especially among some voters who
have reservations about the Texas execution rate.

THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH ONLINE AUCTIONS: CIRCLES OF BIDDERS WORKING
TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., N.J., Colo.)   By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When eBay, the Internet auction company, suspended the seller
and voided the sale of a vivid abstract painting whose price shot
from 25 cents to $135,805 last month, his offense had nothing to do
with the authenticity of the painting or the story he invented to
go with the work.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the seller, Kenneth A. Walton, had entered a bid of
$4,500 on his own offering _ a practice known as shill bidding _ on
the second day of a 10-day auction, long before speculation that
the painting might be by the renowned artist Richard Diebenkorn
sent the price soaring.
</P>
<P>
   But a close analysis of that and other eBay art auctions reveals
that the flourishing cyberauction world faces a deeper, more
intransigent problem than lone self-bidders: the prospect of rings
of shill bidders, acting as partners. Walton, a Sacramento lawyer
who used at least five Internet names selling and buying on eBay,
appears to be just one of a circle of people who have engaged in
cross-bidding activities that may have influenced the outcome of
eBay auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the list of people who bid in the $135,805
auction, and with the help of upset eBay users, The New York Times
researched eBay's auction records and assembled a list of 33
Internet names that repeatedly bid on one another's offerings. The
participants also encouraged other bidders by posting glowing
testimonials to one another on eBay's vaunted feedback system, the
comment forum where people write about their experiences dealing
with other individuals on the site.
</P>
<P>
   This week, after using proprietary software called ``shill
hunter'' to review the list, eBay said it planned to warn two of
the names and noted that 13 of them _ including Walton's _ had been
suspended after the company's own investigations. EBay declined to
disclose why, citing privacy concerns. But that makes 15 user names
that have been disciplined in the wake of the canceled auction.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many rings are operating in the online auction
world _ or, for that matter, in the traditional auction world,
where the practice is generally considered illegal under business
codes and many state laws.
</P>
<P>
   But eBay critics contend that the company's screen is not fine
enough to detect all ring-bidding. The company acknowledged that it
reviewed bids made only in the last 30 days, which may not be long
enough to discern shillers who spread out their false bids. It also
conceded that those in the circle may have changed their bidding
patterns in recent weeks, lying low to avoid attracting attention
once Walton's auction began to make headlines on May 9.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, experts in the art world, academia and law enforcement
say, the fact that the circle surrounding Walton would not have
come to light without the media glare illustrates just how easy it
is for people acting in concert to fly beneath the devices eBay
uses to root out rigged bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for rings,'' said Robert Chesnut, eBay's associate
general counsel. ``We have detected rings. But there is a limit to
shill hunter. And there are things that look like shill bidding
that are not.'' EBay would not divulge how many people it has
expelled for shill bidding.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Every day the opportunity for shilling
grows. This year, sales in consumer-based online auctions in the
United States are expected to more than double, to $6.4 billion, up
from $3 billion in 1999, according to Jupiter Communications, a
research company. EBay's share of the market _ more than 90
percent, Jupiter says _ dwarfs that of Yahoo, Amazon and other
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   At last count eBay had 12.6 million registered users. On any
given day they place 1,000 bids a minute on the more than 4.5
million items up for sale. EBay, whose revenue is expected to
double this year, to $400 million, views the transactions on its
site as private: it does not vet the offerings or descriptions,
though it does try to remove outright frauds.
</P>
<P>
   Though eBay explicitly forbids shill bidding, company officials
say they recognize that there will always a few bad apples in a
community as large as the city of New York.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing in eBay's rules prevents a person from using more
than one Internet name. Nothing prevents friends from bidding on
one another's offerings, running up the price, so long as the bid
is sincere. Nothing prevents friends from posting nice comments
about one another. It was only on March 1 that eBay began requiring
those feedback comments to be related to actual transactions.
</P>
<P>
   While online auctions are thus ripe for manipulation, tracing
possible bidding collusion is extremely difficult. It involves
sifting through and cross-referencing dozens of bidding histories
and user feedback records, hours of work.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Joe Public,'' said Delores Gardner, a lawyer who
specializes in Internet fraud at the Federal Trade Commission.
``I'm not convinced that many people are sophisticated enough to
detect shill bidding. It takes a lot of work, and it's not the type
of work that a buyer should have to do.'' Most complaints to the
commission have been about shoddy merchandise or failure to deliver
the goods, not about bidding shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   EBay, citing cost considerations and storage capacity, removes
auction records from its site after 30 days, which makes detection
harder. And even while a bidding history is available, the bid list
discloses only the highest offer entered by each Internet name,
which sometimes masks the progress of bids. Walton's painting, for
example, drew 95 bids, but the bid history contains just 17 names,
and prices on it leap from $7,701, entered by
``animationconnection'' on May 4, to $135,505, entered by
``howdyhi'' on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happened in between is now a mystery, one that
provokes other questions about the bidding of people using Internet
names that include ``birdaroo,'' ``artpro,'' ``w.'' and Walton's
own ``golfpoorly,'' ``advice,'' ``grecescu'' and ``cheesesix.'' (He
has not disclosed his additional names.) Along with several others,
these names have regularly bid on one another's items but have
rarely placed the winning bid, and they have patted each other on
the back in feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 17 bidders on Walton's $135,805 painting, at least six _
in addition to Walton himself _ had bid on but not purchased the 36
other offerings he had placed for sale on eBay in the 30 days
before his now canceled sale.
</P>
<P>
   At least three of those six had already paid tribute to Walton
on his feedback page. And that tally does not include Walton, who
after buying a $2 CD from himself under a different Internet name
commented that he was charged less than expected for shipping and
called himself ``a really cool guy.''
</P>
<P>
   During 1999 and early this year, Walton wrote equally flattering
testimonials for five of the 17 bidders (four others plus himself).
And seven of the 17 bidders have received positive feedback from
several buyers and sellers who have links with Walton and with one
another in other recent eBay auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Some overlap is coincidental. It is in fact inevitable, because
buyers and sellers who are interested in one kind of item, like
paintings, will gravitate to those offerings, which are made again
and again by the same sellers. Some buyers prefer to do repeat
business with sellers simply because they know that those sellers
deliver.
</P>
<P>
   But if the extent of the overlap seems remarkable in this and
similar cases, eBay disagrees. ``Sometimes bidding just looks
suspicious,'' Chesnut said, ``especially in areas of collecting
that are narrow, where of course you'll be bidding in the same
area.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He recounted the tale of a judge the company bounced for
shilling who was indignant about the false accusation. ``I could
give you a half dozen other examples where we accused people of
shill bidding falsely, and they were outraged,'' he said. ``The
evidence was circumstantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the eyes of some bidders, online auctions, under the
current rules, are hoaxes waiting to happen. Walton's offering
simply brought to a head complaints many say they have already made
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay has created a monster that has grown beyond its capacity
to monitor and to police the misdeeds of some very simple kinds of
fraud out there,'' said Louis Richman, the financial editor of
Consumer Reports. Richman, who believes that shill bidding and
misrepresentation occur frequently online, said that his magazine
had no statistics about them but was designing a research project
to study online auctions systematically.
</P>
<P>
   When the stakes are small _ the average eBay sale is about $40 _
the harm may be minimal, certainly too small for prosecutors to
bother with. But a man who bid more than $126,000 on Walton's
abstract painting, and who said that after spending a week
researching Diebenkorn he had asked friends and relatives to chip
in another $125,000 if he needed it to win, feels lucky to have
escaped without mortgaging his life. (The painting's authenticity
remains unclear.)
</P>
<P>
   The man, a resident of the San Francisco Bay area who insisted
on anonymity because he feared retaliation from eBay devotees,
withdrew his bid after Walton refused to let him see the painting
in person.
</P>
<P>
   This bidder placed an offer of $126,200 at 2:30 a.m. on May 7,
about 42 hours before the bidding was to close. Then he went to
bed. ``By the time I got up, I had already been outbid,'' he said.
He bid a little more, but when ``howdyhi'' suddenly ``came out of
nowhere'' and upped the ante to $135,505 he decided he had to see
the painting before going higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howdyhi,'' whose real name is Mark Therrell and who lives in
Placerville, Calif., about 50 miles from Walton's home in
Sacramento, did not respond to an e-mail message and could not be
reached by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Among the early bidders in this auction were several whose names
regularly turn up, often in succession or nearly so, on other
offerings by a small circle of sellers.
</P>
<P>
   On May 2 Walton, using the name ``advice,'' put what he called
an ``outstanding estate oil _ Arabs on Horseback'' up for sale.
Among the bidders, 17 in all, were ``odona,'' ``astheworldturns,''
``artpro,'' ``1ackley'' and ``jgle,'' the last four in succession,
according to the posted bid history. Walton, using the name
``grecescu,'' also bid on the item, but that bid was canceled by
eBay on May 10, when the company suspended Walton for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   In April, 10 of 17 bidders _ including ``jgle,''
``astheworldturns,'' ``artpro,'' ``birdaroo,'' ``estate-queen'' and
``flipbackwards'' _ that seem to be in the circle bid on an exotic
genre painting put up for sale by ``w.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in April, ``astheworldturns,'' ``jgle,'' ``1ackley,''
``big-fat-mamba-jambas'' and ``cheesesix'' _ one of Walton's names
_ made offers in near succession on an ``abstract oil painting by
Hager'' put on the block by ``boyscoutsofamerica.'' They comprised
five of the 14 bidders for the painting.
</P>
<P>
   And in April, Therrell's sister, Alice Therrell, who also lives
in Placerville and uses the name ``pogdog(at)jps.net'' on eBay, put
up for sale a ``large oil painting by Califano _ his best!'' Among
the 16 bidders were ``astheworldturns,'' ``education1,''
``birdaroo,'' ``artpro'' and Walton, using the name ``grecescu.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those names, eBay has suspended ``education1,'' ``w.,''
``flipbackwards'' and Walton's names. It plans to warn
``boyscoutsofamerica'' as well as another name submitted to eBay by
The Times, ``docharpo.'' The others remain registered users in good
standing.
</P>
<P>
   Not every painting sold by ``advice,'' ``boyscoutsofamerica'' or
others who appear to be in the circle has attracted such
cross-bidding. But many do.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Sbar, a New Jersey doctor who uses the name ``docharpo,''
denied being part of any bidding ring. E-mail messages or phone
calls to the other Internet names were not returned. Walton's
answering machine said he was away this week, but in the past he
has said that all of his questioned bids were made on behalf of
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Greenleaf, an associate professor of marketing at the Stern
School of Business at New York University who has researched the
traditional auction process, said that there were two good clues to
indicate that someone is shill bidding for a friend: ``if the only
time he bids is when some one person is selling and if the
underbidders are very geographically close.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the information eBay users provide for other eBay
users, many in this circle of repeated interacters live in northern
California or Colorado.

 &HT;    ATTN EDS.: Runs with ELIAN-RULING-COX
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Following are excerpts from Thursday's ruling in the
Elian Gonzalez case by the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals:
</P>
<P>
   The important legal question in this case, therefore, is not
whether Plaintiff may apply for asylum; that a six-year-old is
eligible to apply for asylum is clear. The ultimate inquiry,
instead, is whether a six-year-old child has applied for asylum
within the meaning of the statute when he, or a non-parental
relative on his behalf, signs and submits a purported application
against the express wishes of the child's parent. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In this case, because the law . . . is silent about the validity
of Plaintiff's purported asylum applications, it fell to the INS to
make a discretionary policy choice. The INS, exercising its
</P>
<P>
   gap-filling discretion, determined these things: (1)
six-year-old children lack the capacity to sign and to submit
personally an application for asylum; (2) instead, six-year-old
children must be represented by an adult in immigration matters;
(3) absent special circumstances, the only proper adult to
represent a six-year-old child is the child's parent, even when the
parent is not in this country; and, (4) that the parent lives in a
communist-totalitarian state (such as Cuba), in and of itself, does
not constitute a special circumstance
</P>
<P>
   requiring the selection of a non-parental representative. . . .
According to the INS policy, that a parent lives in a
communist-totalitarian state is no special circumstance, sufficient
in and of itself, to justify the
</P>
<P>
   consideration of a six-year-old child's asylum claim (presented
by a relative in this country) against the wishes of the
non-resident parent. We acknowledge, as a widely-accepted truth,
that Cuba does violate
</P>
<P>
   human rights and fundamental freedoms and does not guarantee the
rule of law to people living in Cuba. . . . Persons living in such
a totalitarian state may be unable to assert freely their own legal
rights, much less the legal rights of others. Moreover, some
reasonable people might say that a child in the United States
inherently has a substantial conflict of interest with a parent
residing in a totalitarian state when that parent _ even when he is
not coerced _ demands that the child leave this country to return
to a country with little respect for human rights and basic
freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, we cannot properly conclude that the INS policy is
totally unreasonable in this respect . . .
</P>
<P>
   We have not the slightest illusion about the INS's choices: the
choices _ about policy and about application of the policy _ that
the INS made in this case are choices about which reasonable people
can disagree. Still, the choices were not unreasonable, not
capricious and not arbitrary, but were reasoned and reasonable. The
INS's considerable discretion was not abused.. . .
</P>
<P>
   When the INS was confronted with Plaintiff's purported asylum
applications, the immigration law of the United States provided the
INS with no clear answer. The INS accordingly developed a policy to
deal with the extraordinary circumstances of asylum applications
filed on behalf of a six-year-old child, by the child himself and a
non-parental relative, against the express wishes of the child's
parents (or sole parent). The INS then applied this new policy to
Plaintiff's purported asylum applications and rejected them as
nullities. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Because the preexisting law compelled no particular policy, the
INS was entitled to make a policy decision. The policy decision
that the INS made was within the outside border of reasonable
choices. And the INS did not abuse its discretion or act
arbitrarily in applying the policy and rejecting Plaintiff's
purported asylum applications. The Court neither approves nor
disapproves the INS's decision to reject the asylum applications
filed on Plaintiff's behalf. . .

 UNDATED: or Colorado. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without help from eBay, it is difficult to determine how
frequently members of this circle bid or buy. But some clues are
available through eBay's feedback system, as evident from a
feedback posting on eBay about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Within four days, 10 of the names that regularly appear in
relation to Walton placed complimentary comments on the feedback
site for a seller named ``pigroast.'' ``Eh ... eh ... You sure do
know how to `cook' up one good game deal, pigroast,'' wrote
``1ackley'' on May 27, 1999. A day later, ``big-fat-mamba-jambas''
added: ``Hallelujah, Pigroast! May the Lord Come Down And Bless
Your Kind Soul!! Amen.'' Other compliments are either equally
obscure or underscore ``pigroast's'' dependability, as in
``thriftstorebob's'' comment: ``bargain city ... deal of a lifetime
... an asset to the Ebay community!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the appearance of those comments, ``pigroast''
had posted return compliments for each Internet name.
</P>
<P>
   Three of ``pigroast's'' 10 admirers _ including Walton, using
the name ``grecescu'' _ bid in the $135,805 auction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet eight of the 10 names in the ``pigroast'' feedback have two
or fewer feedback comments from other eBay users _ and they include
comments from ``pigroast'' himself. The scant number usually
indicates that these bidders rarely complete transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Of these names, eBay has suspended ``pigroast'' and
``thriftstorebob,'' while the rest remain members in good standing.
</P>
<P>
   In another uncanny episode, Therrell, who as ``pogdog'' is an
active art seller on eBay, offered a painting about six months ago
that stirred notice.
</P>
<P>
   According to a few eBay users, including David J. Carlson, a
Carmel, Calif., art dealer who employs three ``e-pickers'' to
search for authentic paintings on eBay that he might buy for
resale, ``pogdog'' put up for sale an abstract painting that also
resembled a Diebenkorn. The description never used Diebenkorn's
name and made no claim about the artist. Like Walton's, Therrell's
offering included a close-up of the work with the signature
``R.D.'' easily discernable. Therrell did not return a phone call
seeking comment or respond to an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Auction records for that offering on eBay are no longer
accessible, and the company declined to provide a bidding history
or any information about the offering, citing policy and an
inability to track the offer now. But Carlson recalls that the work
fetched more than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pogdog's'' feedback record includes many highly complimentary
comments from some of the same people. ``Artpro,'' for example,
posted two, including ``THE MOST HONEST SELLER, WITH THE BEST ITEMS
AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ON EBAY-BY FAR!,'' while ``1ackley'' wrote,
``PAINTING WAY BETTER THAN DESCRIBED! THE MOST HONEST SELLER ON
EBAY!''
</P>
<P>
   Greenleaf, the N.Y.U. professor, said he believed that Internet
companies like eBay could detect rings of friends who bid on one
another's online offerings if they wanted to. ``There should be
patterns that would be very suspicious,'' he said. ``These
companies have powerful computing ability, and it would be easy to
search for coincidences. But it's time-consuming, and eBay is very
laissez-faire.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So far, eBay has responded to reports of shill bidding mainly by
suspending a user for 30 days on the first violation and
indefinitely on the second. The company, however, said that to date
most incidents of malfeasance involve credit card fraud and the
failure to deliver goods.
</P>
<P>
   But as online auction fever grows, bidding fraud could get
worse. ``The Internet offers more opportunities to shill than
traditional auctions because you have a lot of time to think about
it,'' Greenleaf said. Furthermore, he said, the cost to a shill
bidder who gets stuck with his own property is lower, because
commission rates are just 1 to 5 percent online compared with as
much as 30 percent at Christie's and Sotheby's and at least 10
percent on Sotheby's online sites.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Bamberger, an antiquarian book dealer in San Francisco who
applauds eBay for broadening the art and antiques market, also said
companies like eBay could do more to reduce fraud. ``One of the
things I've lobbied for is to get the records left up on the site
longer,'' he said. ``They could play it into great P.R., and they
hardly have to do anything.''

SPORTS COLUMN: SEEING RED 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. DOES a bull get mad when he sees red?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. A cow gets mad when she sees red. A bull gets mad when
people mistake him for a cow.
</P>
<P>
   Old joke. But it brings to mind a reverse thought off what is
becoming a commonplace theme: the Knicks are better without Patrick
Ewing. In fact, what might be the case is, the Pacers are better
without Rik Smits.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have grown louder about Ewing since the Knicks have won
their only two playoff games against the Pacers this series without
their longtime center, who was hobbled by injury in those two
games.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but consider Smits, his counterpart center. When the Pacers
made their great run to overcome the Knicks' 18-point lead
Wednesday in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, Smits, for
much of that time, had been replaced by Dale Davis. And Smits was
scoreless in the game, 0 for 6 from the floor. He had 4 rebounds,
compared with the substitute forward Derrick McKey, who gathered in
9. And in the final quarter, with the Pacers holding off the
Knicks, to take the three-games-to-two lead in the series, Smits
was a sedentary spectator.
</P>
<P>
   So, if Smits is in the game when Ewing is in the game _ and the
Pacer strategy is obviously to insert Smits when Ewing is at his
post _ then perhaps the Knicks are actually better with Ewing in
the game because that means that Smits is in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Food for thought, no?
</P>
<P>
   Remember Game 3, when Smits scored 21 points in the first half?
The Pacers could manage only a 1-point lead at the half. And they
eventually lost, with Smits scoring just 4 points in the second
half. Of course, both Smits and Ewing have had their superb moments
recently, but those sweet minutes are becoming more rare. Ewing was
superb, to be sure, in the first quarter of Game 5, scoring 9 of
his 13 points, including one dazzling spin layup. He even made a
pretty pass, for his lone assist in the game. And the glorious
effort, it seemed, wore the warrior out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Smits had come out with some remarks the other day that
he'd rather play against Ewing than the spryer Knickerbockers. This
particularly riled Knick Coach Jeff Van Gundy. ``How,'' asked Van
Gundy, in effect, ``does Smits have the nerve to diss my future
Hall of Famer?''
</P>
<P>
   Smits, as it were, was simply being honest. He loves it when
Ewing is reluctant to challenge him when he's ogling the hoop to
launch a 3-pointer. And Smits, like Ewing, aging belligerents both,
are so battered from metatarsal to patella to pectoralis major,
that at times it seems the only way they can drive to the basket is
nurse-aided.
</P>
<P>
   After the Knicks' practice Thursday at SUNY-Purchase College and
prior to Game 6 Friday night in Madison Square Garden, Ewing was
given, as the pols say, equal time. Did he believe the Pacers were
better without Smits?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about that stuff,'' he said. ``I have nothing to
say about it. My foot is a little sore and I'm going to ice it.
I'll be ready for tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   And Van Gundy on Ewing's value in this year's playoffs: ``We
beat Miami with Patrick on the floor.'' And the Smits factor? ``No,
the Pacers aren't better without Smits. What matters is how a group
on the floor is playing. There's no set, predictable group at any
time. It's all a human factor, how players are playing. It varies
from game to game.''
</P>
<P>
   So Van Gundy, to avoid elimination Friday night, has to be
concerned not only with Smits versus Ewing, but also with Travis
Best, the Pacer point guard, who, Van Gundy says, gets better every
game, from no points in Game 1 to 24 points in Game 5. And he must
be concerned with Jalen Rose, who is a terror when he's not in a
stupor. And Mark Jackson, who does everything to the smaller Knick
guards but bully them for pocket change.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there is still Reggie Miller, who has been
relatively quiet in this series _ after two spectacular series
against Milwaukee and Philadelphia leading into this one. The
impression here is that Miller, invariably a menace to the Knicks,
is just hiding behind a door waiting to jump out and shout,
``Boo!''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do moves on the court separate one player from the
other, but also which players are put on the court and when
separates one coach from another. That's why some players are
better than others, and some coaches are better than others. Ewing
and Smits both, if used wisely, can contribute handsomely. Both,
however, have a tendency to slow their teams down.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Larry Bird, Pacer coach. Enter Van Gundy. Let the
profundity begin. &QL;

   PORTLAND, Ore. _ If it's true the Los Angeles Lakers need a
little adversity to sharpen their focus, then the mere thought of
losing their All-Star guard should be enough to snap them to
attention for tonight's Game 6 of the Western Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant's sprained right foot kept him off the court for a
second straight practice Thursday, and although officially he's
listed as probable, coach Phil Jackson couldn't say for certain
that he'll play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll know game time,'' Jackson said. ``He's not ready to
practice yet. We'd like to have him out there, but it's just not
comfortable enough for him now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who injured the foot in the first quarter Tuesday night,
received treatment Thursday and left without speaking to reporters.
But his teammates are confident he'll be on the floor _ if not
necessarily 100 percent _ tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he'll be out there,'' Robert Horry said. ``It's the
most important game of his career so far, so he'll be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant hasn't missed a game since returning from a broken hand
Dec. 1, and has since played through a variety of sprains, pulls
and bruises. So the Lakers find it difficult to believe he won't
play tonight, with a finals berth at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hasn't even crossed my mind,'' Glen Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant wanted to shoot Wednesday, but Jackson pulled him off the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he understood that as much as there's a need to be out
there on the floor and get a rhythm, there's also a need to
preserve himself for an opportunity if he has it (Friday),''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   If Bryant does play, there's no telling how much the injury
might slow him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it might be a blessing in disguise,'' Horry said.
``That way he doesn't have to be running around so much, putting a
lot of pressure on himself to try to carry us, and just hit his
open J's, because he can do that so well also.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Derek Fisher, ``We feel like with Kobe we can go in there
and win. Without him, it definitely makes it a lot harder. But I
think we still feel confident enough in the other members of this
team that we can figure out a way to go up there and win.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Extended: Chris Bodaken, the team's director of video
services and part-time scout, has signed a new multiyear contract,
the team announced.
</P>
<P>
   Bodaken, a Stevenson Ranch resident and former assistant coach
at St. Francis, has worked on the Lakers' staff since 1993. He
joined the organization as a ball boy in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Little-used rookie swingman Devean George, out
for the last week with a badly sprained left ankle, is out
indefinitely.

NEW YORK'S HISPANIC COMMUNITY MOURNS FOR TITO PUENTE, ITS MAMBO
KING 
</HEADLINE>
  (With OBIT-PUENTE) 
 By JUAN FORERO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The cars, some with Puerto Rican flags fluttering
from windows, slowed to a crawl Thursday as they passed Tito
Puente's, the restaurant on City Island in the Bronx co-owned by
the mambo king himself.
</P>
<P>
   Most simply rolled past, the drivers and occupants looking sadly
at the name Tito Puente on the large neon sign and the
green-and-white awning. Others went inside, glancing at countless
pictures of the famous band leader and percussionist. A few left
roses and carnations at the bar, with one follower leaving a
handwritten note, ``Tito, you will be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   While the man known as El Rey, or the King, had millions of fans
the world over, across the Bronx and the rest of New York City,
where the musical legend was first and foremost known as Tito, he
was also seen a much more: A hero for the Puerto Rican community,
and a role model for the young. A man who, despite his great
success, had never forgotten his roots.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a superstar, but he was part of the community,'' said
Bob Gotay, 48, who spent three hours Thursday afternoon outside
Tito Puente's, reminiscing about a man whose music had attracted
him since his childhood. ``You knew that every time you saw him,
that for one more day the culture was safe and in good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotay said he and other Bronx residents of Puerto Rican descent
who had long followed Puente's career felt the need to be at the
restaurant, an establishment where the orchestra leader often dined
on filet of sole in plum tomato sauce, gave interviews to reporters
and, on occasion, played his music to a rapt crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just wanted to take a look and say goodbye in our own way,
take a glance at the sign and maybe connect with him,'' said Gotay,
a Con Edison customer service representative who grew up in the
Soundview section of the Bronx. ``It was just a nostalgic thing,
come out here, sit a couple of hours and pay homage to a guy who
touched my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although born in East Harlem, where he began his career playing
in neighborhood haunts, Puente would later leave an indelible mark
in several clubs in Midtown Manhattan, like the Palladium and La
Casa Del Mambo, as well as many clubs the Bronx, said friends and
fellow musicians. Through the late 1960s and into the early 1980s,
he played at clubs like the Hippo Campo on Jerome Avenue, Colgate
Gardens in the South Bronx and the Hunts Point Palace. Those who
played with him or saw him perform can never forget the flamboyance
and energy that went into every song.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a tremendous influence, not only for the up-and-coming
bands, but also for the people who came out dancing, who wanted to
have contact,'' said Ramon Rodriguez, director of the Harbor
Conservatory for the Performing Arts in East Harlem, a musical
school that Puente often visited. ``This was the only music where
people could get close to their superstars, unlike in the American
market where superstars are untouchable.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicky Marrero, 50, a percussionist and Bronx resident who often
performed with Puente, said that the master showman became a
``heartthrob for the salseros here,'' speaking of the die-hard
dancers who lived for the nights when they could dance to Puente's
music.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Bronx, wow, you breathe the name Tito Puente and it's
like breathing oxygen,'' he said. ``He was like oxygen to us. And
he made a lot of people happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Bauzo, a teacher at the Harbor Conservatory who also
played with Puente, said that the Puente built a following not just
with his music, but by making friends and remembering names. ``He
was always very accessible to the public,'' recalled Bauzo, 52.
``You couldn't just walk down the street with him. You'd have to
leave an hour early because he would be stopped constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   While his popularity would often take him around the world, he
often returned to such places as Jimmy's Bronx Cafi on Fordham Road
in the Bronx, a famed restaurant and night club, and Willie's Steak
House on Westchester Avenue. Year after year, he also played at
local venues to raise money for Tito Puente Scholarship Fund, which
gave needy teen-agers a shot at college.
</P>
<P>
   Sherley Ghappour, a waitress for three years at Tito Puente's,
said that she was always impressed by how Puente would make small
talk with her, treating her the same as he treated other famous
musicians and politicians. ``Forget it, he was a beautiful
person,'' she said. ``If I ran in, he'd be, like, `Hi how are you.'
He would kiss me. He was always such a happy person.''

CLINTON TELLS BARAK U.S. IS COMMITTED TO MIDDLE EAST PEACE
PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for complete rewrite to restructure and add background.) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal _ President Clinton said Thursday that a
historic peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians was
``within view now,'' and he urged both sides to make whatever
compromises were needed to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks after a 90-minute meeting with Israel's prime
minister, Ehud Barak, in this seaside capital, Clinton also
announced that he was sending Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
to the Middle East next week in an effort to ``work with both
leaders on narrowing the gaps'' between them. And he said that he
would meet soon with the Palestinians' leader, Yasser Arafat, in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also prepared to convene a three-way Camp David-style
summit meeting in Washington with Barak and Arafat, said a senior
administration official who briefed reporters. But the official
added that before that could happen, both sides would have to make
substantial progress, and that because the differences are so
great, Albright would need to make a second trip to the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting would be modeled on the one that President
Jimmy Carter held at the Camp David presidential retreat in 1978
that pushed Israel and Egypt to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both leaders know from me and they know from their own
experience,'' Clinton said, ``that they now have to be prepared to
make an intense effort and to do things that they have not done in
the past with real courage and vision if we're actually going to
get a framework that deals with the outstanding issues.'' Clinton
met with Barak before heading to Berlin for the second leg of a
weeklong trip that is to be his last visit to Europe as president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks underscored his frustration that the Israelis
and Palestinians have not made more progress toward completing a
final peace accord by their self-imposed deadline of Sept. 13.
Negotiations in Stockholm aimed at drafting an outline for a final
settlement were suspended last week after violent protests in Gaza
and the West Bank. The agreement is supposed to settle issues that
have been unresolvable for decades: the size and shape of a
Palestinian entity, the future of Jerusalem and the fate of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday's meeting, Barak emphasized the tense atmosphere
between the Israelis and Palestinians when he accused Arafat of
stalling during the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent weeks, we have seen some dragging of feet in regard
to the running of negotiations,'' Barak told reporters. ``We are
trying to initiate a major move forward,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat responded by saying that Israel was stalling the talks,
not the Palestinians. ``They are the side that is wasting time and
not moving toward peace,'' Arafat said Thursday in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The strong language was a significant change in tone for Barak,
who almost never engages in public criticism of his adversaries,
even his political opponents at home. His comments Thursday could
have simply reflected that he is actually upset with the
Palestinians and the lack of progress. Or his statement could have
been part of the routine back-and-forth of public diplomacy that
Barak is known to loathe and seldom use.
</P>
<P>
   But his uncharacteristically strong words may have been timed to
appear resolute before the Israelis just as he is apparently ready,
according to leaks in the press, to make long-delayed concessions
in the negotiations. The talks are expected to resume this weekend
or sooner, though it is not yet clear where.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It has been evident from Clinton's tone during this trip just
how much he wants to conclude a peace agreement between Israel and
the Palestinians in the last months of his presidency, and that he
is prepared to invest the time it would take to do so.
</P>
<P>
   On some issues, like Kosovo, European security and trade,
Clinton has sounded at times as if business is over. For instance,
his discussion of a proposal on a limited missile defense system
lacks the passion that he brings to his discussion of peace between
Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States will do everything we can to help them pass
this milestone,'' he said Thursday in remarks made to the staff at
the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon. ``This is tough work. If it were easy
somebody would have done it a long time ago. But actually, it is
within view now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his top aides on the Middle East believe that
Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon a week ago has transformed the
political landscape in the region and created a new opening for a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Several times in briefing reporters, the senior administration
official referred to ``the new reality'' on the ground and the
``moment'' that will not last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made that clear at a news conference on Wednesday when
he called the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon ``daring'' and added
that it ``imposes a much greater sense of urgency'' on all the
parties to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of activity by Clinton as his presidency nears its
end is reminiscent of the push for an Arab-Israeli peace by the
Reagan administration in 1988. Then, the ``moment'' to be seized
was the Palestinian uprising known as the intifadeh, which prompted
a new peace initiative by then Secretary of State George Shultz.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barak and Arafat have said their goal is to reach agreement
by mid-September. If they do not, Arafat has threatened to
unilaterally declare a Palestinian state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But ``moments'' and deadlines for Middle East peace agreements
come and go. After two days of meetings with Barak and Arafat in
Norway last November, for example, Clinton said he was beginning a
``last sprint'' for a peace settlement. At the time, the goal was
to forge a framework agreement by February 2000 that would serve as
a blueprint for a final peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Then the deadline slipped to May. But the two sides were too far
apart to meet even that deadline, and now the focus has shifted to
the September date.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, administration officials were unwilling to discuss the
details of the meeting between Clinton and Barak, but one senior
administration official said that Clinton tried to draw out Barak
on each of the outstanding issues: borders, refugees, Jerusalem and
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Israel has handed over 42.9 percent of the disputed West
Bank to the Palestinians. And it has agreed to turn over to the
Palestinian Authority three Arab villages near Jerusalem. The most
difficult issues continue to be worked out through several secret
channels between the Israelis and Palestinians, with only
unsubstantiated details coming through leaks to the press. For
instance, one report by a Barak critic said that for a final deal
to be reached, Israel will have to give up 95 percent of the West
Bank, not 60 percent to 75 percent, which has always been the
working assumption. But none of the actual details of the
negotiations have been released.
</P>
<P>
   Albright on Monday will travel to the Middle East directly from
Kiev, where Clinton will meet Ukrainian leaders on the final stop
of his trip, the senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges facing Albright are not new, nor has she had a
particularly successful record on her trips to the Mideast. In
September, on her first trip there since Barak came to power,
Albright encountered a typical snag when the Israelis and the
Palestinians failed to deliver an agreement for a signing ceremony
in Egypt that she had hoped to preside over. And in 1997, just two
weeks after her first official visit to the Middle East, in which
she urged the Israelis to take time out from expanding settlements
on the West Bank, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
announced plans to build more housing there.
</P>
<P>
   Albright will not stop in Syria during her visit to the Middle
East, the official said. Talks between Israel and Syria collapsed
in January and have not resumed despite direct consultations
between Clinton and President Hafez Assad of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The senior administration official who briefed reporters on
Thursday also confirmed that the United States has agreed to
earmark $50 million of the $1.8 billion of U.S. military aid
budgeted for Israel to shore up Israel's border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israel estimates that a new defense line will cost from $300
million to $400 million. The withdrawal of Israel's army from
southern Lebanon last week after 18 years erased a buffer zone that
had shielded northern Israel from attacks from Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton spoke by telephone with Arafat, who
recently described the talks with Israel as deadlocked and was said
to be unhappy with ideas proposed by Israel in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Abu Rdaineh, a senior aide to Arafat, told Reuters in
Jerusalem that Arafat had ``informed President Clinton about the
current situation of the peace process, especially the current
stalemate and the deadlock it has reached.''

 &HT;    Looking for a spark
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there is solace in the Bronx, it is because the
New York Yankees are performing exactly as they did at this time
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Yankees swerved all over the first two months of their
season, too.
</P>
<P>
   The first weekend of interleague play finds the defending world
champions still awaiting the jolt of inspiration that drove them
from a 24-19 start last spring to another romp through October.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reasons, it hasn't happened. The Yankees just went
through a 13-13 May, the club's first non-winning month since
August of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can just sort of knit one and pearl two, you keep it
where it is and sort of tread water until you hit that seven or
eight in a row,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``Then all of sudden,
it's different.'' Shortstop Derek Jeter said, ``You don't want to
say it's like a switch that you can turn on and off, but we're
waiting for that point when everyone is running at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Since an eight-game winning streak that ended April 19, the
Yankees have gone 17-18. Held as the standard for situational
hitting the past two seasons, these Yanks have been out-hit 24
times in their first 49 games. They have been sustained by
excellent pitching, but David Cone and Roger Clemens are a combined
5-10.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, when the World Series rings were handed out earlier
this week, Clemens found his bearing the No. 33. That was the
departed David Wells' number. Clemens was wearing No. 22 the night
he beat John Smoltz in Game 4 of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Was it so long ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wearing the crown is a very delicate thing,'' Torre said.
``You have to remember that it doesn't give you any free ticket
anywhere. It's not something to be stuck in anybody's face like,
'We're the world champs. We don't have to work as hard as you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Yankees carried a heavier burden. They dealt with the
manager's cancer case, Darryl Strawberry's suspension and what
Torre calls ``the albatross of the 125 wins'' from the historic
1998 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That team stood 29-20 after 49 games and was 1 1/2 games behind
Boston in the AL East. These Yankees come to Atlanta 28-21 and 1
1/2 games behind Boston. The 1999 club emerged from its black cloud
to play .611 baseball, 77-49, and go 11-1 through the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   This team has encountered none of the emotional trauma, just a
steady drizzle of injuries that has put the projected Opening Day
lineup on the field 11 times in the first 49 games.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Scott Brosius missed the first 18 games with a
rib-cage pull. Left-hander Andy Pettitte missed three starts with a
strained back. Jeter missed two weeks with an abdominal strain,
during which time New York lost eight times in 12 games. His return
is hoped to be an omen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek makes us better just by being on the field,'' Brosius
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks can get better in plenty of places. The 1999 champions
batted .282 and averaged 5.6 runs a game. This year, the Yankees
are hitting .269, 12th in the league, and scoring 4.8 runs. Last
year's team walked 4.4 times a game, third in the league; this
year's walks are 3.4, 13th in the league. This team also is on pace
to commit 11 more errors.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves series should sound a bell. Starting this weekend,
the Yankees play 17 games against first-place teams _ the Braves,
Boston and the Chicago White Sox _ during the next 24 days, plus
three more against the rival Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bullpen has been the only thing that's been consistent,''
Jeter said. ``We're still waiting for that point for everything
else to pick up. We hope it's coming soon.''

   The federal judge in the Microsoft antitrust case unexpectedly
agreed to delay his final ruling for about a week, giving the
Justice Department time to reply to Microsoft's proposal to water
down the government's breakup plan. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
had planned to issue his final ruling, widely expected to call for
a breakup of the company, by today. But Justice Department
officials asked whether they could reply to Microsoft's comments on

<P>
   DETROIT _ A soon-to-be released government report calculates
that the average fuel economy of new family vehicles has improved
slightly in the 2000 model year, but the numbers would look much
worse if automakers had not begun producing huge numbers of
vehicles that can run on either gasoline or ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers almost never fuel them with ethanol, which is sold by
only 108 of the nation's 178,000 service stations. Nonetheless,
General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler are producing
roughly 750,000 dual-fuel minivans, small pickup trucks and cars
this year at an extra cost of up to $300 each. These vehicles are
counted by the government as getting roughly triple the gas mileage
that they actually achieve, allowing manufacturers to sell more
full-sized sport utilities and pickups while still meeting federal
standards for average fuel economy.
</P>
<P>
   The government report, produced by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, calculated that the average fuel economy for
all new family vehicles sold in the 2000 model year would be 24.7
miles per gallon, after including the special treatment of
dual-fuel vehicles. That is up slightly from 24.5 in the 1999 model
year and the same as in the 1998 model year, but still well below a
peak of 26.2 miles per gallon in the 1987 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Without the benefit from the special treatment of ethanol, the
overall number would be up very slightly from 1999, when many
dual-fuel vehicles were also sold, and down from 1998, when
automakers were just starting to build the dual-fuel vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of large sport utility vehicles and
pickup trucks that are far less fuel-efficient than cars has
lowered the average fuel economy of the nation's vehicles in recent
years. Automakers have made the big vehicles a bit more
fuel-efficient for this model year. But there are so many of them
being sold that they have dragged down the average.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy has become a political issue again this year
because of rising gasoline prices, the possibility of shortages of
certain types of gasoline in the Midwest this summer and growing
criticisms of large family vehicles by environmentalists and safety
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who unsuccessfully
sought his party's presidential nomination earlier this year, has
used his position as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee to
order Congress' General Accounting Office to perform a broad review
of American fuel-economy policies.
</P>
<P>
   At McCain's request, the review is focused on the safety,
environmental and energy conservation issues raised by the
fuel-economy standards for sport utilities and other so-called
light trucks, which are more lenient than the standards applied to
cars. Pia Pialorsi, a spokeswoman for the Commerce Committee, said
on Thursday that the report should be finished by August.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old law that gives special treatment to automobiles
that can burn ethanol or gasoline also requires the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration to prepare an extensive
report of the legislation's effectiveness by the end of the
government's current fiscal year, on Sept. 30. The law will make
the fuel-economy calculations for dual-fuel vehicles less favorable
for automakers in 2004, and manufacturers have already begun
lobbying for an extension of that deadline.
</P>
<P>
   An auto executive who insisted on anonymity said that the
industry was counting on support for an extension of the law from
the farm lobby and from politicians who might want to impress
voters in Iowa, which holds the first presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Leonard, General Motors' policy director for fuel economy
and air pollution, said the fuel-economy credits for dual-fuel
vehicles were needed as an incentive for automakers to build
vehicles that could burn ethanol, a type of alcohol made from corn,
sugar cane or even waste paper. For many years, automakers refused
to build vehicles for which alternative fuels were not available
while the oil industry refused to distribute fuels that few
vehicles could burn. The fuel-economy credits could break the
standoff, Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have long been skeptical of ethanol, mainly
because there have been conflicting studies on whether it takes
more fossil fuels to grow corn and turn it into ethanol than would
be burned by gasoline-powered vehicles. Oil companies do not like
to sell ethanol because it is so corrosive that it cannot be
shipped in steel pipelines, requiring costly trucks, barges, and
rail cars instead, said John Felmy, the director of policy and
statistics at the American Petroleum Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been predictions of a coming ethanol shortage.
The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed the elimination of
a popular gasoline additive, MTBE, which accounts for almost 3
percent of the volume of gasoline, and the use of ethanol instead.
The ethanol industry says it can increase production.
</P>
<P>
   The average fuel economy of new cars has inched up to 28.4 miles
per gallon from 28.3 in the 1999 model year, the report said. But
the average for light trucks _ sport utilities, pickup trucks and
vans _ jumped to 21.2 miles per gallon from 20.7 a year earlier.
Almost all of the automobiles being produced with the capacity to
burn ethanol are minivans and small pickup trucks, like Ford
Rangers with 3-liter engines and Dodge and Chrysler minivans with
3.3-liter engines, as automakers have struggled to comply with
federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Safety agency officials estimated that labeling vehicles as
capable of burning ethanol or gasoline had allowed Ford and
DaimlerChrysler to increase the calculated average fuel economy of
their sport utility vehicles and other so-called light trucks by
about eight-tenths of a mile per gallon in the 2000 model year. The
benefit for GM is four-tenths of a mile per gallon in the current
model year. GM has indicated that it plans to step up production.
</P>
<P>
   The government's rules require each automaker to produce cars
with a so-called corporate average fuel economy of at least 27.5
miles per gallon and light trucks with an average fuel economy of
at least 20.7 miles per gallon. Gasoline prices have recently
increased but over the last decade, adjusted for inflation, they
have been among the lowest ever, and this has helped create demand
for light trucks with poor gas mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives have called repeatedly for Congress to repeal
the corporate average fuel economy rules (known as CAFE) and
replace them with higher gasoline taxes, but there has been no
enthusiasm in Washington for such a move. ``A philosophy of CAFE
that doesn't have a corollary of fuel policy doesn't work,'' said
James Holden, the president of DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit, in
an interview earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The giant Ford Excursion sport utility vehicle and a growing
number of full-size pickup trucks are not included in the
fuel-economy averages at all, because they exceed the maximum
weight that regulators set in the 1970s for consideration as a
family vehicle. GM and Ford told regulators at the time that they
could not envision selling family vehicles weighing as much as
their current models do.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's review and the safety agency's report on dual-fuel
vehicles in September are unlikely to result in legislative action
this year. The Republican majority in the House approved a
transportation budget two weeks ago that, for the sixth year in a
row, bans the spending of federal money to revise federal
fuel-economy rules.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats organized an effort to remove the ban but then
backed away from introducing the necessary amendment, fearing an
election-year split between environmentalists, who favor stricter
standards, and labor unions, which worry that American automakers
depend on big gas guzzlers for their profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is tentatively scheduled to vote in two weeks on a
nonbinding resolution calling for an end to the ban. Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., a state with no auto assembly plants and high
gasoline prices, said that he hoped to do better than last year,
when the Senate defeated a similar resolution, 55 to 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced we'll get more votes than last year, and we've
got a 50-50 chance of winning it,'' Gorton said.

CLINTON FINDS GERMANS CRITICAL OF U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-EUROPE) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ President Clinton arrived in Germany for a three-day
visit Thursday and faced immediate criticism of his
administration's plans to build a limited missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   In a 90-minute meeting with Clinton in the official Chancellery,
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder added his voice to the chorus of
European allies criticizing the administration's plan, telling
Clinton that it could touch off a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside Clinton following their meeting, Schroeder told
reporters that the American president presented his views on his
administration's position ``in a very frank way.'' Schroeder added,
``I then went on and stated my concerns, concerns that we have to
be very careful that any project does not re-trigger the process of
a renewed arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview that will appear in Friday's editions of
Berliner Zeitung, Schroeder was even more forceful, saying,
``Neither economically nor politically can we afford a new round of
the arms race. No one can dispute the Americans' right to develop
what they believe is right for national defense. On the other hand,
we are partners in a common alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Other German officials have warned that the missile defense
would weaken military ties between the United States and its
European allies. And they have accused the United States of
overstating the threat.
</P>
<P>
   In his own remarks to reporters, Clinton did not respond to
Schroeder's assertions. But in briefing reporters later, the
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, acknowledged the
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expressed his concern that we proceed with due
consideration for the impact on others, including Europe,'' Berger
said in summing up Schroeder's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   A number of European leaders are concerned that a missile
defense system could upset existing disarmament accords,
particularly the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia,
which must be amended to allow for the missile defense plan.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton nor any of his aides have made the point _ at
least not publicly _ that the administration's plan is far less
ambitious than one proposed by George W. Bush, the presumptive
Republican nominee for president, who is ready to abandon the ABM
treaty as a relic of the past.
</P>
<P>
   But Berger stressed that the discord was ``not at all sharp,''
adding, ``It was a very intelligent discussion of a very
complicated issue.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton laid out the American conviction that it
must find ways to counter dangerous emerging nuclear threats like
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about how we proceed with Europe and their sense
of comfort level with this,'' Berger paraphrased Clinton as telling
Schroeder. ``But ultimately, I've got to make a decision in terms
of national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's criticism slightly tarnished the opening of
Clinton's visit to Berlin, the first by an American president since
it became the capital of a united Germany following the end of the
Cold War. On Friday Clinton travels to Aachen, the ancient capital
of Charlemagne, to receive the Charlemagne Prize, awarded annually
to a person who has worked toward European unity and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   On another area of contention between the United States and
Germany, Clinton expressed American concern over Germany's handling
of child custody cases involving American parents.
</P>
<P>
   According to the State Department, Germany favors German parents
in custody cases and prevents American parents from gaining access
to children living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Two high-profile cases involve Lady Catherine Meyer, the wife of
the British ambassador in Washington, and Joseph Cooke, a New
Yorker. Meyer's two sons from a previous marriage were abducted by
their German father; she has been allowed to see them for a total
of 24 hours in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke has been fighting to regain custody of his two children,
who were handed over to foster parents in Germany seven years ago
after his wife, a German, fled there with them and declared she was
mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder announced Thursday that Germany would set up a working
group of experts with the United States to investigate custody
disputes involving American parents, but warned he could not
interfere directly in the court system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has recently come under pressure from an organized lobby
of American parents who complain that Germany has violated
conventions guaranteeing the return of kidnapped children.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the House of Representatives endorsed the effort in a
resolution, voting 416-0.

BRUINS WILL FEEL THE HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ A movie poster proclaims the road trip is ``the
greatest college tradition of all.''
</P>
<P>
   In baseball parlance, the road trip could refer to Louisiana
State's Alex Box Stadium. Only for UCLA's baseball team, it's not
considered great.
</P>
<P>
   Daunting is a better word, for this is UCLA's challenge: winning
a Super Regional series at a place that has 8,000 fans screaming
and stomping on metal bleachers close to the field.
</P>
<P>
   In heat and humidity considered extreme by California standards.
</P>
<P>
   Against a team ranked second nationally that has won 84 percent
of its home games since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way: When UCLA coach Gary Adams scouted LSU, a
fellow coach who had a football player on his team said playing at
LSU was louder than a goal-line stand at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the closest Pac-10 stadium is at Arizona State, but
you'd have to ``multiply ASU by 10,000 times'' to equate it with
LSU.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's regional at Oklahoma City, UCLA played in some
humidity and suffered a bit. It's worse in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the College World Series, the Bruins (38-24) have to
beat the Tigers (46-17) in a three-game series that starts today.
</P>
<P>
   ``How we handle the crowd will be a factor,'' Adams said. ``I've
been told that's the toughest element. Well, that's tied with the
heat and humidity.''
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA were a bunch of eager-eyed freshmen, Adams would be more
concerned. But since this is a junior-laden team that went 18-14 on
the road this season, Adams is less concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have offensive firepower. UCLA has outfielder and
Alemany High graduate Bill Scott (.430, 21 HR, 75 RBI), first
baseman Chase Utley (.389, 21 HR, 67 RBI) and catcher Forest
Johnson (.356, 22 HR, 76 RBI).
</P>
<P>
   LSU, which outscored its regional opponents 45-4 last week, has
catcher Brad Cresse (.399, 29 HR, 100 RBI), the son of former
Dodgers coach Mark Cresse, and first baseman Brad Hawpe (.366, 9
HR, 72 RBI). The Tigers also have won seven straight and 12 of 15.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams also have some pitching, but the offenses often
overshadow them. The Bruins likely will start Rob Henkel (6-3, 5.59
ERA), then come back Saturday with Josh Karp (10-1, 4.72 ERA),
leaving either John Brandt (7-5, 4.02 ERA) or Bobby Roe (7-5, 5.36
ERA) to start Sunday's if-necessary game.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime this weekend, LSU will throw Brian Tallet, a 6-foot-7
left-hander who's 13-3 with a 3.20 ERA and 121 strikeouts in 123
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their talent matches up with ours,'' Adams said. ``They aren't
the No. 2 team in the nation for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is making its 11th postseason appearance and fourth in the
last five years. Perhaps unfortunately, UCLA's region (at Oklahoma
City last week) was rated 15th of the 16 regions, and LSU's was
second. Had LSU not won its region, UCLA would have hosted today's
Super Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't work out that way, so the Bruins have their noisy,
sticky and sweaty challenges ahead.

BUSH ANNOUNCES PROPOSALS ON CONSERVATION OF SCENIC AREAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAND HARBOR STATE PARK, Nev. _ With Houston's pollution problems
seemingly light years away, George W. Bush on Thursday stood on the
shore of a sparkling Lake Tahoe to announce proposals to boost
conservation of scenic areas and other natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Key to Bush's plan are tax incentives to help spare pristine
land from development and giving local governments and private
landowners a greater voice in conservation decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and likely Republican presidential nominee,
under fire from environmentalists over air pollution problems in
Houston and other Texas cities, chose one of the nation's most
scenic areas to encourage preservation of what he called ``the
living presence of the great almighty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to preserve places like this in America,'' he said.
``It is our duty to use the lands wisely _ and sometimes not use
them at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But the governor quickly drew fire from the campaign of Vice
President Al Gore, his likely Democratic opponent and a politician
long associated with environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trusting George W. Bush to protect our land, air and water is
putting the fox in charge of the henhouse,'' a Gore spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also pointed out that Texas is 49th among the states
in per capita spending on parks and recreation.
</P>
<P>
   The key points of Bush's conservation plan include:
</P>
<P>
   --Fully funding the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund at
$900 million a year and using half of the money to provide funding
for state and local conservation efforts. The fund, established 35
years ago, has never been fully funded, according to the Bush
campaign. Federal funds come primarily from revenues from offshore
oil and gas drilling.
</P>
<P>
   --Exempting 50 percent of the profit from land sales for
conservation purposes from the capital gains tax. Bush said this
tax break was necessary to encourage people who couldn't afford to
give their land away to sell it to protect wildlife or plant
habitat or for other conservation purposes.
</P>
<P>
   --Matching grants for states to establish incentive programs to
help private landowners protect rare species while engaging in
traditional land management practices.
</P>
<P>
   --Eliminating the estate tax. This proposal, which Bush has
repeatedly advocated, would cost $55 billion over five years, his
campaign said, but would protect ``cash-poor'' farmers and ranchers
from having to sell part of their land to developers to pay
inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it was wrong for Washington to unilaterally restrict
uses of federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government and the states, local communities and
private landowners must respect and work with one another to
preserve our natural heritage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a private lands enhancement program in Texas has
worked well. It allows state experts to provide technical
assistance to private landowners who want to protect wildlife or
preserve natural habitat. Bush said nearly 10 million acres in
Texas are under wildlife management plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign said the Texas Legislature authorized $60
million in bonds for parks in 1997 under Bush's administration.
</P>
<P>
   An environmentalist active in an effort to preserve Lake Tahoe,
which straddles the Nevada-California state line, gave Bush's
proposals a mixed review.
</P>
<P>
   Rochelle Nason of South Lake Tahoe, Calif., executive director
of the League to Save Lake Tahoe, said tax credits were a
``positive thing'' for conservation but weren't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Nason said it wouldn't always be in the public interest to turn
over control of federal lands solely to local communities. ``The
needs of the American people as a whole have to be considered when
you're looking at the management of federal lands,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nason said Gore also has been supportive of conservation
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   While in Nevada on Thursday, Bush also attended private
fund-raisers for his campaign and for the Republican National
Committee's presidential trust, which will assist his presidential
effort. They were among a series of fund-raisers that Bush has
attended in several western states this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet news service Salon reported Thursday that Nevada
donors included casino owners.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the GOP's religious conservatives have moral objections
to gambling, and disapprove of accepting donations from members of
the gambling industry. Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush
doesn't accept money for his presidential campaign from gambling
political action committees, but doesn't try to screen the business
interests of individual donors.

Noboa, eliminates the need for what was expected to be a
politically divisive trial of General Mendoza, above, who has said
other senior military commanders were involved in the plot but
refused to identify them.

   CANADA: ENVOY BACKS GORE
</P>
<P>
   Canada's ambassador to the United States has effectively
endorsed Al Gore over George W. Bush in the presidential race. ``We
know Vice President Gore, he knows us; he's a friend of Canada,''
Raymond Chretien said in a speech to Canadian officials. The
ambassador, a nephew of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, said,
``Governor Bush, on the other hand, doesn't know us as much,''
adding, ``When he thinks of borders, he thinks of Mexico, not of
Canada.''

   MEXICO: CARDENAS PARTY FINED
</P>
<P>
   The party of the leftist presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas was hit with fines of $253,082 by the federal elections
agency for filing incomplete accounts of its spending last year,
the highest of the sanctions levied against 11 political
organizations. The governing Institutional Revolutionary Party was
fined only $6,571.

   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Saturday night's Star Formula Mazda race at
Irwindale Speedway might be the biggest in Larry Couture's racing
career.
</P>
<P>
   Couture, the vice president of technical development and
transfer at City of Hope National Medical Center, has had a lot of
victories and top finishes. But when he takes to Irwindale's
half-mile oval, it will be his first race in front of the hometown
fans. He contributes half his winnings to the Duarte-based research
medical facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people at the City of Hope know I race and they're
making this a big deal,'' he said. ``A lot of people will be coming
out and that's pretty exciting. It's unusual for a vice president
of an institution like this to race. Most people don't know someone
personally who races, so this is as cool as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Also racing will be the NASCAR Late Model series in twin 40-lap
races, Super Stocks and Grand American Modifieds. Qualifying for
those classes starts at 5 p.m., with racing beginning at 7 p.m. The
Star Mazda series qualifies today, but the grandstands will not be
open.
</P>
<P>
   Couture admits that, amid all the hoopla, Saturday's event will
be quite challenging. The 43-year-old Claremont resident has raced
on only one oval course, earlier this year. He and his crew-chief
wife, Jill Mathison, who is also employed at the City of Hope, are
rookies in the pro series and their team is one of only three in
the series that is not part of a factory team. The series is
considered a steppingstone to the larger open-wheel road racing
series.
</P>
<P>
   He got his start racing in the Formula Ford series and in the
Vintage Auto Racing Association series the past four years, getting
several victories and top-five finishes. He opted for the Star
Mazda series because of the cost considerations, the
competitiveness of the younger drivers and the chance to race on
ovals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was usually near the front of the pack and felt it wasn't
very competitive,'' he said of his previous racing. ``In this
series, there are 20 very talented drivers in virtually identical
cars. This is taken all very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Couture is in 14th place in the Western Division standings after
four races. He was 19th in his first Formula Mazda race on the mile
oval at Phoenix International Raceway, 14th at Buttonwillow and
26th and 17th in a two-day, two-race event at Thunderhill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to fit in,'' he said. ``I'm in the middle and
lower end of the pack. I'm pleased to be in 14th. I feared I'd be
worse and I hoped for better.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing in Formula Fords gave him plenty of road-racing exposure.
One reason he chose the Star Mazda series was the chance to race
ovals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix was exhilarating,'' said Couture, who thinks _ with
the right sponsorship package _ that he could be racing in the
Indianapolis 500 in three or four years. ``It's very intimidating
and nothing like road racing.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ A federal appellate panel Thursday upheld the right of
immigration officials to let Elian Gonzalez's father take the boy
back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Court of Appeals, in
Atlanta, ruled unanimously that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service had the power to decide that only a parent can act for such
a young child in immigration proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The decision let Juan Miguel Gonzalez take a step closer to
bringing his son home, though the panel barred Elian from leaving
the United States for at least 21 days to give his Miami relatives,
who have fought to keep him from returning to Cuba, time to appeal
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is seen as a solid defeat for the relatives who took
him in after his mother and 10 others drowned in a failed crossing
from Cuba. The boy was found floating on an inner tube off the
Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   The judges said that the law gave wide discretion to the INS in
such cases and that the powers of the executive branch should be
respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case, at first sight, seems to be about little more than
a child and his father,'' the panel wrote in their decision. ``But,
for this court, the case is mainly about the separation of powers
under our constitutional system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   That plain language, said some legal experts, will make a
successful appeal difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important step in achieving the goal we have
sought from the very beginning, to give Juan Miguel and his family
the opportunity to return to a life together,'' said Attorney
General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   But the Elian case has involved more than a family. It has drawn
international attention _ not all of it good _ to Miami and its
powerful Cuban-American community, stirring resentment among the
city's other ethnic groups and leading to turmoil in city hall.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-page ruling upheld a decision by a U.S. district judge in
March that Elian was too young to comprehend a complicated asylum
application, and that his father's rights to bring him home
outweighed the desires of the boy's Miami relatives to keep him in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was written by Judge J. L. Edmondson, who was
appointed by President Ronald Reagan, and was joined by Judge Joel
F. Dubina, an appointee of President George Bush, and Judge Charles
R. Wilson, an appointee of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel, in Atlanta, found that the INS was
``within the outside border of reasonable choices'' in denying the
child's asylum application, which he had signed in a childlike
scrawl, ``ELIAN.''
</P>
<P>
   David Abraham, a professor of immigration law at the University
of Miami, said the panel merely recognized ``the conservative
traditions of respecting the separation of powers and recognizing
that Congress has delegated the authority to make the calls in
tough cases'' to the INS..
</P>
<P>
   ``The court found that INS was not arbitrary in what it did,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives were, as of Thursday evening, still weighing
their options in appealing the decision. They can either ask for a
re-hearing of the case by the same three-judge panel, or appeal the
decision to the full 11-judge 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, or
appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not concluded; we're going to keep fighting for
Elian's freedom,'' said Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great uncle and
the man who defied federal orders to give up the boy.
</P>
<P>
   His defiance led to a raid on April 22 in which federal agents
took the boy from his home and brought him to Maryland, where he
was reunited with his father. Father and son are now staying in
Washington in a home owned by an international youth organization.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether there is solid grounds for an appeal, Kendall
Coffey, one of the Miami family's many lawyers, said the ruling
``did not constitute a resounding endorsement of the way INS
handled this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The appellate panel did, in fact, write that ``the court neither
approves nor disapproves the INS decision to reject the asylum
application filed on plaintiff's behalf.'' But, the judges wrote in
their ruling, the INS did not contradict federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank the American people,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez
said in Washington, D.C. ``I hope we can finally go home.''
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Gregory B. Craig, said it is time for the Miami
relatives to give up their battle to keep Elian. ``It is now time
to end this chapter of Elian's life and to let this family go in
peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the little house in Little Havana where Elian lived for
almost five months, news of the ruling drove several women to their
knees on the narrow asphalt street.
</P>
<P>
   Men wept outside the house, a shrine of sorts here in Cuban
Miami, even though Elian's Miami relatives are no longer staying
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hurt,'' said Bienvenido Comas, 27, a city of Miami
engineer. ``I cried today. But I have no more tears.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no violent outbreaks in the city, even in the heart
of Little Havana, where protesters had burned dumpsters and tires
and clashed with police after the raid. Police made more than 300
arrests then.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there was only sadness and disillusionment outside
the tiny walk-up cafes that usually buzz with political talk and
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's a gloomy day,'' said Jose Portonado, an artist who
lives in Little Havana. ``But I knew it was gonna happen. I just
knew it. In the back of my mind I was hoping there would be some
master plan we did not know about. This was our last hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But the return of Elian to Cuba is still, more than likely, at
least a few weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel said a previous injunction they issued to keep
Elian in this country during appeals remains in force until the
panel issues a mandate to enforce Thursday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But such a mandate would not be issued until seven days after
the case is effectively closed under federal appellate rules. The
panel shortened the usual 45-day period to formally close the case
to 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Miami relatives have just 14 days to appeal the
case.
</P>
<P>
   If they want to appeal the case directly to the Supreme Court,
their lawyers must seek a separate order staying Elian's departure
from a Supreme Court justice or the entire court.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not appeal, which is unlikely, the mandate to enforce
the order would be filed in 21 days.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In Miami, political and legal experts said the saga will not do
Miami any good if it is prolonged even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case demonstrated that the overwhelming majority of
Americans were not prepared to have distant relatives kidnap a
child from his relatives as a way of continuing a 40-year-old
struggle,'' said Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   But here, where hatred of Fidel Castro is still fresh, many
Cuban-Americans cannot stand the thought of returning the child to
a Communist country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time of desperation,'' said Comas.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, President Bill Clinton said he was pleased with the
court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have said before, this is a case about the importance of
family and the bond between a father and son,'' Clinton said in a
written statement from Berlin, the second stop on the president's
European tour. ``I have supported the justice Department's
conclusion that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is the one
best suited to speak for his child.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Atlanta, Vice President Al Gore said he continued to
believe that a family court should decide Elian's case. George W.
Bush, campaigning in Nevada, said Gore should urge Clinton to allow
such a family court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, said the family has no
choice but to keep fighting any way it can. ``We are going to keep
searching for the laws that Elian is entitled to,'' he said. ``So
that Elian Gonzalez remains in a free country, as his mom wished.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time, which Tito Puente could make throb, pulsate,
swivel, shake, exultate and finally, in the pounding rhythms of
mambo, cross over from the barrio in Harlem to the Palladium in
midtown Manhattan and onto the airways of America, caught up with
the legendary band leader and percussionist late Wednesday night,
when he died at age 77.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered complications after open heart surgery at New York
University Medical Center, his manager, Eddie Rodriguez, said.
</P>
<P>
   The man known as El Rey, the king, who put Mambo on the map _
and who came to be nearly as much a symbol of New York City as
Yankee Stadium _ had been scheduled to perform at a benefit
Wednesday evening at Christie's auction house.
</P>
<P>
   The most important Latin musician of the last half century and a
key figure in the fusion of Latin music with jazz, Puente was an
ebullient performer who often mugged and laughed as he whapped away
on his timbales.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else have I got to sell?'' he said a few months ago when
asked about this style. ``I'm not Ricky Martin, to wave my hips
around and show my belly button. I don't have a girl in front of
the band singing. I need the people to see I'm having a good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Known to the youngest of his fans as the man who wrote Carlos
Santana's hit ``Oye Como Va,''or perhaps from the 1992 movie ``The
Mambo Kings,'' in which he played himself, Puente had a career that
spanned five decades.
</P>
<P>
   There were few jazz stars from the be-bop era and beyond who did
not find him a compatible playing companion, and he was a staple of
the old Salsa Meets Jazz series at the Village Gate nightclub in
Manhattan and the JVC Jazz Festival, where he often stole the show
from more conventional jazz players.
</P>
<P>
   While many jazz groups added jazz sounds to Latin rhythms,
Puente liked to add a Latin rhythm section to a straight jazz
arrangement. A fine showman, he was not beyond gimmicks like
recording Dave Brubeck's ``Take Five'' in four-four time. He was
also tireless; even in recent years he worked between 200 and 300
performances a year.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Puente at the beginning of his career, bringing Latin
music to a new audience at the Palladium on Broadway at 53rd
Street, that made many grow nostalgic Thursday at the news of
Puente's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave us all a life,'' said Robert Farris Thompson, a
professor at Yale University, where Puente had been awarded a Chubb
Fellowship earlier this year, ``And by us I mean not only Puerto
Ricans, but mainland blacks, huge numbers of Italians and Jews. We
all loved him. There were guys my age who were envious they weren't
at the Moulin Rouge in the days of Toulouse-Lautrec; who weren't at
Minton's in the days of the birth of bop. I was secure in the
knowledge that I had been there on the birth of New York mambo.''
</P>
<P>
   Puente's personal life was not tame. During World War II, on
leave, he married a longtime girlfriend, Mirta Sanchez. In 1947,
they had a son, Ronald. The marriage ended in divorce. Today, both
live in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, Puente had a longtime relationship with Ida
Carlini, a dancer, now living in Miami, who says she met Puente at
The Palladium as a girl of 15. (``An Abby Lane type, gorgeous,''
one Palladium regular recalls.) Their son, Richard Anthony Puente,
was born in 1953. He became a musician.
</P>
<P>
   There followed a 30-year relationship with the former Margaret
Acencio, with whom Puente had a son, Tito Puente Jr., a musician,
and a daughter, Audrey Puente, a television weather forecaster in
New York. He and his wife were married, Puente told The New York
Times, ``four or five years'' ago, with their 28-year-old son and
30-year-old daughter serving as their parents' best man and best
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not taken a vacation in my whole life,'' Puente said in
that conversation, four months ago. ``Let me ask you a question:
Have you ever known a musician to take a vacation? You know when
you're on vacation? When the phone don't ring.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   A musician who often said that he was ``born in rhythm,'' Ernest
Anthony Puente was born on April 20, 1923, at Harlem Hospital and
grew up on 110th Street, off Madison Avenue, in the neighborhood
then known as Spanish Harlem, or the barrio. Both his parents were
immigrants from Puerto Rico; his father worked in a razor blade
factory and there was a younger sister and a younger brother. Life
was not easy: his father, Puente said in an interview in The New
York Times last April, was a gambler, and his brother died at 4, in
a fall from the fire escape.
</P>
<P>
   The young Tito was a drummer from the time he could remember,
drumming so loudly and so often, on the kitchen table, with pots
and pans, that the neighbors beseeched his mother to get her son
music lessons. She did, though to get the 25 cents a lesson she
needed, she had to go through her husband's pockets for money when
he was asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Puente studied piano, then drums, then timbales _ a rack-mounted
setup of drums, cowbell, woodblock and other percussion
instruments, which provide crisp upper-register rhythms for Latin
bands. He also toyed with the idea of becoming a dancer, performing
in the neighborhood with his sister, Anna, before either was in
their teens. They performed ballroom, acrobatic, tap, heavily
influence by the dance idols of the day, Fred Astaire and Gene
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   But the music took precedence. Puente's big break came in the
'40s, when the United States entered the war. The drummer from the
Machito Orchestra, one of the first bands to fuse jazz and Latin
music, was drafted, and Puente took his place. At 13, he was a
professional. A few years later, Puente dropped out of high school;
the band, he would say years later, would provide schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Puente served in the Navy during World War II. He served in nine
battles, later receiving a presidential commendation.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Puente studied at the Juilliard School of Music
under the GI Bill. But the school's emphasis on classical music
made him restless. In 1948, he started his own band, the Piccadilly
Boys. Later, saying he did not want a band the name of which could
be confused with something on the menu (picadillo is a meat and
potato hash), he changed the name to the Tito Puente Orchestra. His
early distinctive touch, putting percussion in front, happened by
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pretty boys were always in front, the percussion always in
the back,'' Puente said in an interview with The Toronto Star.
``But the frontman needed to get their rhythm cues from the
percussion and someone suggested putting the rhythm in front
instead. Now everyone does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Puente's first hit, Abaniquito, came one year later. By the
early '50s, the band had become the Tito Puente Orchestra and was
packing them in at New York's Palladium. Mambo was king and Tito
Puente was king of mambo, recording dance favorites such as
``Barbarabatiri.'' ``El Rey del Timbai'' and ``Mambo Gallego.'' In
the late '50s, Puente was fusing cha-cha _ the hot Latin crossover
dance of the Catskills _ with big band compositions.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, Puente began to collaborate with other New York
musicians, including Celia Cruz, who would become the queen of
Latin Music to his king, with the trombonist Buddy Morrow, with
Woody Herman. In 1963 he recorded ``Oye Como Va'' which 12 years
later would be a hit song for Carlos Santana, and still later, a
running joke with Puente, who often publicly thanked Santana for
his royalties. In 1968, Puente had his own television show, on
Hispanic television, ``The World of Tito Puente.''
</P>
<P>
   The '70s were a down time for Puente.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a boogaloo era, and there were some other
nonmusical fads, and he had to do things to keep up with the Jones
that were not so good for his records,'' said Johnny Rodriguez,
Puente's longtime road manager. But in the '80s, and particularly
in the '90s, he was coming back. He recorded with such jazz
musicians as Phil Woods, George Shearing, James Moody, Dave
Valentin, Hilton Ruiz and Terry Gibbs; he and his band often
performed with symphony orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   He also became a sort of symbol of the New York Puerto Rican
identity, marching prominently in Puerto Rican parades. In 1995,
Puente opened a popular 250-seat restaurant on City Island, the
maritime enclave just off the coast of the Bronx. It featured a
Caribbean-Hispanic menu with Puerto Rican specialties and, of
course, Latin jazz.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, President Clinton recalled his remarks
when he gave Puente the National Medal of Arts in 1997. ``Just
hearing Tito Puente's name makes you want to get up and dance,''
Clinton said then.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar Hijuelos novel, ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of
Love,'' which became a film in 1992, ``The Mambo Kings,'' offered
sweet vindication. In that story two Cuban brothers move to New
York in the '50s and form a mambo band; Puente is portrayed as the
king, the center of the mambo universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought playing in those place, writing that music,
experiencing it all, that there would be a movie of it,'' Puente
said in The Times. ``It's a place and time that has really been
overlooked. So this now comes out and I feel good about it. This
will help get out music around the world.''

 &HT;    Holyfield's plans put on hold
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The injured Evander Holyfield likely must wait at
least two months before facing John Ruiz, a two-month delay in his
grand plan to regather the three major heavyweight titles.
</P>
<P>
   Their June 10 date was postponed because of Holyfield's torn
muscle below the ribs on his left side, and promoter Don King said
Thursday in Las Vegas that the makeup would be rescheduled in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Caesar's Palace remains the probable site, King added. The
Showtime cable network will carry the bout for the vacant WBA
crown.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christopher Vaughns, Holyfield's physician in Atlanta, and
Dr. Flip Homansky, ringside physician for the Nevada State Athletic
Commission, estimated that Holyfield would require about four weeks
to heal. He would then need a few more weeks to train, though he
can continue aerobic work.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said he was hurt in a sparring session on May 21 on a
blow to the small of his back on the right side. The left side
began to tense up later.
</P>
<P>
   He visited a doctor in Houston, where he trains, three times
within five days, then phoned his attorney in Atlanta, Jim Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time he sparred, it got a little worse,'' Thomas said. He
returned to Atlanta on Wednesday for an MRI, which revealed the
torn muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a serious injury,'' Homansky said, ``but
it's incapacitating when he throws a punch. He can take a punch.''
</P>
<P>
   As Holyfield put it, ``It only hurts if I hit the opponent. I
hurt myself to hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas insisted the injury is unrelated to Holyfield's advanced
boxing age (37) and lengthy fight resume (41, including four losses
and a draw).
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Thomas said. ``It's a simple athletic
injury. It has nothing to do with age or deterioration. This could
happen to an 18-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has never before pulled out of a fight, though Thomas
says he twice regrets not doing so.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the ring with Michael Moorer in 1994 with a sore
shoulder. ``And it cost him,'' Thomas said, recalling the loss by
decision. ``The shoulder pretty much tore out in the second
round.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, in a rubber match with Riddick Bowe, Holyfield
took ill leading up to fight night and absorbed a technical
knockout in the eighth round.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield also mentioned that he was sick last year against in
his first meeting with Lennox Lewis, which was controversially
scored a draw. ``He kept those (ailments) to himself,'' Thomas
said. ``He wants to be 100 percent for this fight. ``
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said, ``I'm cheating myself by not going in at 100
percent. Two or three times before, I should have said I'm not
going out there. I'm a lot smarter than I was then.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Stone, Ruiz's trainer/manager, described his fighter as
devastated by the development. He said Ruiz turned down a bout with
Lewis for $2.5 million to take $1 million against Holyfield.. And
he noted that Ruiz has recovered from hand surgery a month ago,
caused by a broken cereal bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ready to go,'' Stone said.

GORE EXPANDS ON PLAN FOR CANCER TREATMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vice President Al Gore announced Thursday a new plan
to pay for early cancer screenings, give patients faster access to
cutting-edge treatments and outlaw discrimination by insurers and
employers based on genetic test results.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will work with you to
put the same energy and priority into fighting cancer that we would
put into preventing a war that would take 500,000 American lives
every year. The stakes are that great,'' Gore told cancer
researchers at Emory University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who lost sister Nancy Gore Hunger to lung cancer,
announced last year that if elected president, he would double the
amount of federal money spent on cancer research to total $9
billion over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after visiting young cancer patients, he expanded
on that plan, telling researchers at Emory that he would propose a
``fast-track'' for approving preventive benefits for Medicare
patients to pay for cancer screenings. He also would do away with
deductibles and co-payments for Medicare recipients seeking
mammograms and testing for colorectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's plan also would expand Medicaid coverage to
cover colorectal cancer. Legislation currently before Congress
would provide that coverage for breast and cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Citing President Kennedy's speech promising to put a man on the
moon, Gore promised to make it a national priority to ensure early
detection and treatment of colon cancer. When detected early, there
is a 96 percent survival rate for colon cancer, he said, yet today
only 61 percent of those diagnosed survive because their cancer is
too far along before it is diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next decade, he said, ``no one in America should have
to die from colon cancer, breast cancer or prostate cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not get there, and certain forms of these diseases may
be beyond our reach,'' he said. ``But of this much we can be
certain: If we don't set the goal, we will never get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was accompanied by his brother-in-law, Frank Hunger,
said that when he hears the word cancer, ``I see the faces of
friends and neighbors who have been stricken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the people I have met across this country who have
battled back with unyielding courage and determination,'' he said.
``I know from my own experience what cancer can do to a family.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore stopped short of telling his sister's story, which made
headlines during the 1996 Democratic National Convention when he
was forced to acknowledge that he continued to receive money from
his family's tobacco farm for several years after her death.
</P>
<P>
   Gore Hunger, who began smoking as a teen-ager, died in 1984. She
was 45.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, during a town hall meeting with undecided
voters in Macon, Gore was challenged by two tobacco company
employees who said they fear the federal government's anti-smoking
campaign would cost them their jobs. Gore said he sympathized, and
would work to preserve jobs, but he said he would not yield on his
top priority of preventing companies from targeting children in
their advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen someone die from lung cancer,'' he said. ``I am just
not going to compromise on this. I am not.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he reiterated that pledge, saying, ``We need to
stop them from marketing a deadly product to children.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also vowed to make sure the benefits of cancer research and
treatment are accessible to all Americans, regardless of race or
economic status. ``Right now African-Americans are one-third more
likely to die of cancer than white Americans,'' he said. ``We
simply need to change that.'' &QL;

REPRIEVE BY BUSH REFLECTS NEW ROLE OF DNA   TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Governor George W. Bush's decision Thursday
to grant a stay of execution to Ricky McGinn, a convicted child
rapist and murderer, is striking evidence of how advances in DNA
technology are shaking a longstanding national consensus on crime,
punishment and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   As DNA tests have freed thousands of suspected and convicted
inmates _ including eight men condemned to death _ new doubts have
been raised about the reliability of the criminal justice system.
Unquestioned support for capital punishment is no longer perceived
as a political slam-dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an evolving consciousness among everyone: the public
and the politicians,'' said Richard Dieter, executive director of
the Death Penalty Information Center, an anti-death penalty group
here. ``Now Governor Bush has recognized the importance of DNA
evidence _ and that doubts can well arise in capital cases, despite
unanimous juries and the appellate process.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in two terms as governor, during which 131
men and women have been executed in Texas, Bush granted a 30-day
reprieve Thursday, just half an hour before McGinn was scheduled to
die. It was a startling turnaround for a politician who has
steadfastly defended capital punishment and who, like his famous
father, has used his willingness to impose the death penalty to
appeal for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision was surprising as well in light of the facts in
the McGinn case. McGinn, 43, was convicted of raping his
12-year-old stepdaughter and then hacking her to death with an ax
in 1993. Her blood, and the bloody ax, were found in his car. A
pubic hair and semen found on the victim were tied to McGinn by
traditional forensic lab tests.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn will now have the opportunity to have DNA tests run on
the hair and semen. If the evidence is shown to be from someone
else, McGinn's attorneys will argue that he should be exonerated of
rape. Because Texas law requires that a death row inmate be
convicted of a serious felony in addition to murder, he could then
escape execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is overwhelming evidence that McGinn is guilty of the
murder. So what they are saying is, `Yes, he may have hacked her to
death, but you can't prove he raped her first.' It is a strange
case to choose as an example,'' said Joshua Marquis, an Oregon
prosecutor who serves on the board of directors of the National
Association of Defense Attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his years as governor, Bush has consistently listed
the question of guilt or innocence as his primary concern when
allowing executions to proceed in Texas. But political and legal
experts said Thursday that in the current climate it is problematic
for any presidential candidate _ even a law-and-order governor like
Bush _ to turn down a condemned inmate's request for a DNA test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Governor Bush is in a very awkward position running
for president: the opponents of the death penalty have been trying
to make Texas the poster child of capital punishment,'' said
Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   Marquis is one of many law enforcement officials who are worried
about the amount of attention given to DNA testing. Though only one
in 10 condemned inmates maintains a claim of innocence to death,
and one in 100 has proven his innocence, the publicity given to DNA
cases makes it seem that hundreds of innocent men and women linger
on death row, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they have changed the climate,'' Marquis said
of death penalty foes, ``but they have certainly distorted the
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The political climate has been undeniably altered since the 1988
and 1992 presidential campaigns, when Presidents Bush and Clinton
employed their support for capital punishment to help propel them
to the White House. And it was just four years ago that Clinton
signed legislation passed by a Republican Congress that
dramatically curtailed the rights of condemned prisoners to appeal.
At the time, four of every five Americans supported capital
punishment, and worried that executions were being needlessly
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the ink from Clinton's signature dried on the
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, a trickle of
news reports about the results of DNA testing began to transform
public opinion. The trickle turned into a torrent as the news media
reported on hundreds of cases where accused or convicted prisoners
were set free by virtue of a DNA test. Other condemned prisoners
were released from death row when news organizations, defense teams
_ and in one some celebrated instances a Northwestern University
journalism class _ exposed flaws in the prosecution's case without
using DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, in a 1996 report titled ``Convicted by
Juries, Exonerated by Science,'' concluded that DNA testing exposed
disturbing flaws in the US judicial system. Post-conviction DNA
tests, the department said, revealed the limitations of such
traditional law enforcement tools as police and eyewitness
testimony, the use of jailhouse informants, and blood type and hair
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Another Justice Department study, released last September,
concluded that ``the strong presumption that verdicts are correct .
. .has been weakened by the growing number of convictions that have
been vacated because of exclusionary DNA results.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, whose labs handle DNA testing for local law enforcement
officials from around the nation, reported that of 10,000 sexual
assault cases from 1989 to 1995, DNA tests revealed that 20 percent
of the men identified as the primary suspects by eyewitnesses or
the police were, in fact, innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just seeing case after case where it sure looked like
somebody was guilty and it turns out the eyewitness was wrong or
the police withheld evidence or the DNA found that a blood test was
less than accurate,'' said Dieter, of the Death Penalty Information
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives such as columnist George F. Will and preacher Pat
Robertson have joined New York lawyer Barry Scheck, who served on
the O.J. Simpson defense team, in endorsing the burgeoning
``innocence'' movement. Lawmakers like Senator Patrick Leahy of
Vermont and Representative William Delahunt of Quincy, both former
prosecutors, have introduced legislation in Congress to give
inmates a right to DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the death penalty in the Gallup Poll has dropped
from 80 to 66 percent. In Illinois, Governor George Ryan has
declared a moratorium on executions after 13 death row inmates
there were exonerated. The New Hampshire legislature recently voted
to repeal that state's death penalty _ though capital punishment
was preserved by Governor Jeanne Shaheen's veto.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of DNA testing is such that foes of the death penalty
worry that a double standard may emerge between cases where
testable physical evidence like blood and semen or hair is
recovered, and those where it is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people see DNA as a magic thing, which will solve all
our problems and help us sort the guilty from the innocent. But
whether we are fortunate enough to have DNA to test is an accident,
a stroke of good luck,'' said Austin attorney Raoul Schonemann, one
of a small corps of lawyers who defend death row inmates in Texas.
``It is not enough if we are really committed as a society to not
executing innocent people.''

 &HT;    Defense teams beginning to challenge one another
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The murder trial against NFL star Ray Lewis and two
co-defendants created an odd alliance Thursday, pitting flamboyant
defense attorney Bruce Harvey and Fulton County District Attorney
Paul Howard against Lewis' own high-powered legal team.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' team, as it has often in the trial, won that encounter.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident, and one earlier in the day, were the first
glimpses of cracks in the united front that the three murder
defendants and their seven attorneys have erected against the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Street, a friend of co-defendant Reginald Oakley, was
flown in from Baltimore to testify Thursday he was with Oakley the
day before he surrendered on murder charges. Street was set to
testify he warned his friend that he'd ``be the fall guy because
Ray Lewis had a lot of money and resources.'' Oakley agreed with
that statement, according to Street.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey wanted the statement introduced, saying that it reflected
on Oakley's ``state of mind'' shortly before he took a bus from
Baltimore to Atlanta to surrender. Harvey wants to show his client
as an underdog.
</P>
<P>
   The jury never heard the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Don Samuel, one of Lewis' lawyers, objected, saying testimony
can't come from one co-defendant against another in a joint trial.
The problem, Samuel said, was Lewis could not cross-examine Oakley,
the other defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner agreed,
basically gutting Street's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The legal confrontation came on the heels of a similar issue
when Atlanta police Lt. Mike Smith quoted Lewis as saying he was
with ``the wrong people'' when Jacinth Baker, 21 and Richard
Lollar, 24, were stabbed to death Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey and Steve Sadow, attorney for co-defendant Joseph
Sweeting, objected vigorously, saying their clients were harmed by
the statement. They wanted their cases severed, which Bonner
denied.
</P>
<P>
   When arguing to get the ``fall guy'' statement into evidence,
Harvey, in a reference to Lewis' team, said, ``The shoe's on the
other foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who commands the homicide division, admitted on
cross-examination Thursday afternoon that he told a witness ``all
African-Americans have nicknames'' out of frustration because he
was getting no real names of the occupants of Ray Lewis' limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no place to go that day. We were stuck on nicknames,''
Smith testified. ``We had `Shorty,' `Derby,' `Fedora,' `AJ,' and I
was trying to link the nicknames with real names; there was tension
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have that misconstrued and if it offends anyone, I
sincerely apologize,'' he said. ``But we wanted the two people or
three people, whoever were responsible for the deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury is composed of 10 blacks and two whites. All the
defendants and the victims are black.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Bonner said she has issued a subpoena for limo driver
Duane Fassett to be recalled Fassett, the state's key witness, did
not testify, as expected, that he had seen Lewis punch a victim or
heard the co-defendants admit to the stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors need to confront Fassett on discrepancies in his
accounts before they can admit into evidence his prior statements.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett is resisting the subpoena in a Maryland court.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Ed Garland, Lewis' lead attorney, read the jury a
stipulation rebutting the testimony of Chester Anderson, the
admitted con man who is the only state witness who said he saw
Lewis kicking a victim. Anderson testified that a man with him also
saw Lewis attacking the man.
</P>
<P>
   However, that man, John DiSiena, told prosecutors he was drunk
and did not see that. Bonner ordered both sides to draw up a
statement saying this.
</P>
<P>
   ``John DiSiena would testify that he did not see Ray Lewis kick
anyone and he did not tell Chester Anderson he saw Ray Lewis
kicking anyone,'' said Garland, standing before the jury box.

 &HT;    Prosecutors say Lewis directed cover-up
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Moments after his stretch limo sped away from where
two young men who lay mortally wounded on a Buckhead street,
prosecutors say, Ray Lewis began a concerted cover-up to escape
blame.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, he ordered members of his party to keep their
mouths shut. Later, he had evidence destroyed and lied to police,
prosecutors contend.
</P>
<P>
   While prosecutors have elicited scant evidence that Lewis
actually assaulted anyone, they are trying to convince jurors that
the star NFL linebacker had a guilty state of mind in the hours
after the killings.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis' attorneys contend there are other reasons behind his
incriminating behavior. And, in this case, Lewis cannot be
convicted of lying to police or obstructing justice because he is
charged only with the more serious crimes of murder, felony murder
and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence does tend to lend itself to an argument of a
consciousness of guilt, that is, Mr. Lewis engaged in the cover-up
because he was involved to some degree,'' former federal prosecutor
Buddy Parker said. ``It would be very important evidence if there
was an additional charge it could apply to, but they don't have
that in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, District Attorney Paul Howard presented Lewis'
statement to police the morning after the stabbings, during which
he lied by saying he couldn't identify most of the limo passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' lead defense attorney, Ed Garland, has conceded that his
client was ``not truthful'' to police. But Garland contends Lewis
was not concealing his guilt. Instead, Lewis ``panicked,'' fearing
the damaging publicity could jeopardize his NFL career, Garland
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony, Lewis did more than lie to police:
</P>
<P>
   As his limo left the crime scene, Lewis turned to his companions
and commanded, ``Keep your mouth shut and don't say nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   After he was seen huddling with his girlfriend Jessica Robertson
in his Georgian Terrace hotel room later thatmorning, Robertson
drove away and stopped behind a fast food restaurant where a fellow
limo passenger dumped a white hotel laundry bag into a Dumpster.
Prosecutors say the bag contained Lewis' bloodstained suit.
</P>
<P>
   A photo of Lewis' entourage, which would have helped police
identify the limo passengers, was destroyed. Limo passenger Evelyn
Sparks said the photo was taken from her purse by Robertson. ``She
said she burned it,'' Sparks testified.
</P>
<P>
   Co-defendant Reginald Oakley was seen wearing an oversize
sweatsuit hours after the slayings, not the outfit he wore Super
Bowl night. Prosecutors will say he got the sweatsuit from Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Jack Martin said the jury will have to sort out
which argument _ the prosecution's or the defense _ is more
believable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem for Lewis is, this type of evidence puts pressure
on him to take the stand to explain his actions,'' Martin said.
``This may be the prosecution's strategy, because their only hope
for conviction may be that the jury doesn't believe Mr. Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lewis is acquitted, Fulton prosecutors may not be able, under
the law, to indict him for a cover-up. ``You get only one bite at
charging somebody in a case like this,'' said DeKalb District
Attorney J. Tom Morgan. ``They needed to put all their eggs in one
basket.''

   Harvey and Steve Sadow, attorney for co-defendant Joseph
Sweeting, objected vigorously, saying their clients were harmed by
the statement. They wanted their cases severed, which Bonner
denied.
</P>
<P>
   When arguing to get the ``fall guy'' statement into evidence,
Harvey, in a reference to Lewis' team, said, ``The shoe's on the
other foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who commands the homicide division, admitted on
cross-examination Thursday afternoon that he told a witness ``all
African-Americans have nicknames'' out of frustration because he
was getting no real names of the occupants of Ray Lewis' limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no place to go that day. We were stuck on nicknames,''
Smith testified. ``We had `Shorty,' `Derby,' `Fedora,' `AJ,' and I
was trying to link the nicknames with real names; there was tension
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have that misconstrued and if it offends anyone, I
sincerely apologize,'' he said. ``But we wanted the two people or
three people, whoever were responsible for the deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury is composed of 10 blacks and two whites. All the
defendants and the victims are black.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Bonner said she has issued a subpoena for limo driver
Duane Fassett to be recalled Fassett, the state's key witness, did
not testify, as expected, that he had seen Lewis punch a victim or
heard the co-defendants admit to the stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors need to confront Fassett on discrepancies in his
accounts before they can admit into evidence his prior statements.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett is resisting the subpoena in a Maryland court.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Ed Garland, Lewis' lead attorney, read the jury a
stipulation rebutting the testimony of Chester Anderson, the
admitted con man who is the only state witness who said he saw
Lewis kicking a victim. Anderson testified that a man with him also
saw Lewis attacking the man.
</P>
<P>
   However, that man, John DiSiena, told prosecutors he was drunk
and did not see that. Bonner ordered both sides to draw up a
statement saying this.
</P>
<P>
   ``John DiSiena would testify that he did not see Ray Lewis kick
anyone and he did not tell Chester Anderson he saw Ray Lewis
kicking anyone,'' said Garland, standing before the jury box.

ADMINISTRATION SHELVES PLAN TO CREATE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE POST 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An ambitious plan to create a federal post to
oversee the government's spy-catching efforts has been shelved by
the Clinton administration, largely because of strong opposition
from Attorney General Janet Reno, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The job of a national counterintelligence executive was proposed
to answer widespread criticism of the government's efforts to
combat espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The official would have been asked to develop and oversee a
strategy to protect the nation's secrets. He would have tried to
stay a step ahead of foreign spies by identifying what information
_ in government and in industry _ would be the most enticing to
other governments.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, the product of a year-long interagency review,
gained high-level support, including from Louis J. Freeh, the
director of the FBI; George J. Tenet, the director of central
intelligence, and John J. Hamre, who until recently was deputy
secretary of defense, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno blocked the proposal, and some officials said they
believed her opposition was the product of her ongoing feud with
Freeh, whose agency is charged with overseeing domestic
counterintelligence.
</P>
<P>
   In letters and conversations with other officials, Reno
indicated that she believed the agency needed to solve its own
internal problems with counterintelligence instead of adding a new
layer of bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Freeh have been at odds over a wide range of issues
over the past few years, most notably Freeh's recommendation, which
Reno rejected, that she appoint an independent counsel to
investigate campaign fund-raising abuses by Democrats in the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the counterintelligence plan, called CI-21, also
surfaced within the FBI, where some senior officials were said to
fear that it would erode the bureau's authority over spy-hunting
operations.
</P>
<P>
   And some Clinton administration officials said they believed the
interagency panel, formed last summer, had gone too far by calling
for major changes in the counterintelligence structure without
adequately consulting with other officials throughout the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a new counterintelligence executive is probably
not going to work the way it was proposed,'' a senior
administration official acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials said, many of the panel's ideas for changing
the direction of counterintelligence may be incorporated in more a
modest reorganization plan in the future. A high-level review of
counterintelligence is still underway within the administration,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that the CI-21 initiative has succeeded in focusing
attention, and what will emerge from that is still evolving,'' said
the Defense Department spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the debate over the proposed reorganization, there is
widespread agreement among senior officials that the government has
failed to keep pace with the rapidly changing espionage threats
faced by the United States in a post-Cold War, information-age era.
</P>
<P>
   Critics agree that the FBI, the CIA and the Pentagon have found
it difficult to shift gears after decades spent keeping tabs on
traditional adversaries, like KGB agents working out of the Soviet
embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as the sole remaining economic and military superpower,
the United States faces a wider range of espionage threats than
ever before, from both allied and unfriendly nations eager to steal
information not just from the CIA or the Pentagon but from
corporations and research institutes.
</P>
<P>
   France, Israel, China, India, Russia and other countries are
believed to have turned their focus on the United States to obtain
sensitive and economically significant scientific and technological
information, as well as traditional military and national security
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials made some changes after the 1994 arrest
of Aldrich Ames, the CIA officer who spied for the Soviet Union.
But several officials said they believed that the National
Counterintelligence Center, established at the agency after the
Ames case, had largely failed to provide coordination for
counterintelligence. The center would have been abolished under the
proposed restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Flaws in the government's handling of some high-profile
espionage cases, including the investigation of Wen Ho Lee, the
former government scientist accused of mishandling government
secrets, have underscored the need for counterintelligence reform,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   (START OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the Lee case, an 800-page classified report by the Justice
Department has just been completed detailing the mistakes made both
at the FBI and at the Justice Department in the way they handled
investigation. The report is said to offer an even-handed critique
of the government's failures in the controversial Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   The report criticizes the FBI for its failure to aggressively
investigate evidence that China may have stolen American nuclear
weapons data, as well as its decision to focus on Lee early in that
investigation. But it also is critical of the Justice Department
for its failure to approve FBI requests to wiretap Lee.
</P>
<P>
   While he was never charged with espionage, Lee was accused of
mishandling classified material after investigators found that he
had downloaded large amounts of sensitive nuclear weapons design
information and then copied it onto portable computer tapes. Some
of those tapes are now missing. Lee has said he is innocent of the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization proposed in the new initiative would not have
altered the FBI's authority to handle criminal investigations into
spy cases.
</P>
<P>
   But it would have created a board made up of senior officials
from the CIA, FBI and Pentagon and advised by other agencies like
State and Treasury. It's executive would have set the broad
direction of counterintelligence strategy, and would had access to
information about ongoing espionage cases.
</P>
<P>
   But the main task of the new executive and the board would have
been to change the nature of counterintelligence. Rather than
simply waiting for evidence that a spy had already stolen secrets,
the new executive would have been asked to bring an analytical
approach to the field, both studying America's vulnerabilities
while trying to determine which secrets were likely to be sought by
other countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's terribly unfortunate that the attorney general has seen
fit to torpedo this, because the concept is very good and
absolutely necessary as we face counterintelligence threats that
are as great as ever,'' said Paul Redmond, a former chief of
counterintelligence at the CIA.

ANALYSIS: TEPID ENDORSEMENT OF GOVERNMENT'S ACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CUBAN-BOY and CUBAN-BOY-POLITICS) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal appeals court ruling Thursday in the Elian Gonzalez
case reaffirmed legal principles that give federal agencies _ and
particularly immigration officials _ wide authority.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by a panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals was a clear but somewhat lukewarm endorsement of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's position that only Elian's
father _ not the 6-year-old boy himself or his Miami relatives _
could decide whether the boy would seek asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the courts should not be unquestioning, we should
respect the other branches' policy-making powers,'' the decision
said. ``The judicial power is a limited power.''
</P>
<P>
   To experts on family law, the ruling was an endorsement of legal
rules that generally declare that, unless they are abusive, parents
speak for their children in deciding where and with whom the
children live.
</P>
<P>
   But some immigration lawyers said they were troubled that the
court's decision gave the immigration service such wide latitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is, this is setting a dangerous precedent for
other children'' who might need to seek asylum in this country,
said Wendy Young, a lawyer and the director for government
relations of the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children.
The group works to increase refugees' asylum and immigration rights
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court,'' Young said, ``is placing in the hands of the INS
the total discretion of deciding which of those claims it will
hear, and which of those claims it won't hear, based on the child's
age.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges suggested that if it had been up to them, they might
have made a different decision and considered whether Elian needed
asylum from the Marxist Cuban government. But they said they were
not permitted to second-guess a decision by immigration officials
that fit ``within the range of reasonable choices,'' even if that
decision ``worries us some.''
</P>
<P>
   The three judges who ruled Thursday _ J.L. Edmondson, Joel F.
Dubina and Charles R. Wilson _ were the same judges who ruled in
April that Elian had to remain in this country while his case was
decided.
</P>
<P>
   Although the decision did little to change existing law, some of
the immigration lawyers said, the judges' hands-off position in
such a high-profile case was likely to be taken by immigration
officials as a signal that the courts would seldom intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling is worrying as a precedent in the sense that there
are many cases in which minors _ mostly unaccompanied _ need to
claim protection from persecution,'' said Arthur C. Helton, an
immigration law expert and a senior fellow at the Council on
Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children said there
were 4,600 unaccompanied children detained for possible deportation
by immigration officials last year.
</P>
<P>
   An applicant is eligible for asylum under the law if he or she
has a ``well-founded fear of persecution'' based on political
beliefs or membership in racial, religious, national or social
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In its opinion Thursday the court itself noted that the decision
could hurt some children. ``We recognize, that, in some instances,
the INS policy of deferring to parents _ especially those residing
outside of this country _ might hinder some 6-year-olds with
nonfrivolous asylum claims,'' the opinion said. But, the judges
concluded, ``we cannot disturb the INS policy in this case just
because it might be imperfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's claim for asylum began with an application filed by his
great-uncle and later an application filed in the boy's own name.
His father subsequently told the immigration officials he did not
want an application for asylum to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's Miami relatives argued that it was by definition
abusive for his father to insist on returning Elian to life in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Courts generally defer to the expertise of administrative
agencies. But in the area of immigration law, courts have held that
the authority of judges is even more limited, because immigration
policy is part of foreign relations, where the executive branch is
given wide authority.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on immigration law said Thursday that they did not
share the concerns expressed by the immigration lawyers who worried
that decision Thursday could harm other children.
</P>
<P>
   David A. Martin, a former general counsel of the immigration
service, said it was standard practice for the courts to recognize
that immigration officials, not judges, are experts in making
decisions about such issues.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who is now a law professor at the University of
Virginia, said the opinion Thursday was of limited reach because
the immigration service conceded that some children could seek
asylum even if their parents object, like when they are threatened
with imminent harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case,'' he said, ``it became a question of line
drawing: When do you consider the wishes of the parent, and when do
you consider the child's case independently?''
</P>
<P>
   Some other immigration law experts said that given the facts of
Elian's case, it would have been extraordinary for a court to force
immigration officials to consider an application filed against his
father's wishes. They cited, among other factors, the boy's age and
his close relationship with his father.
</P>
<P>
   There are cases in which courts have gone too far in refusing to
review the decision of immigration officials, said Stephen H.
Legomsky, a professor of immigration law at the Washington
University School of Law in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But, Legomsky said, ``any court would come out this way in terms
of the father having the right to decide for this 6-year-old
child.''

APPEALS PANEL DENIES ASYLUM HEARING FOR ELIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moving Elian Gonzalez a giant step toward returning
to Cuba, a federal appeals court Thursday ruled that US immigration
officials acted legally in rejecting the 6-year-old refugee's
request for an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives, who helped turned the boy into an
international symbol of the anti-Castro movement, said they may
appeal to the US Supreme Court in a last-ditch effort to block his
repatriation to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel of the
11th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta appears to clear the
way for Elian and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to return to
their communist homeland if their Miami relatives do not succeed in
further court challenges within 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I've always felt from the deepest part of my
heart,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez, outside his lawyer's office in
Washington, said of the ruling. ``A child always should be with his
parents, and I should be speaking on behalf of my son.''
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Gregory Craig, said, ``It is now time to end this
chapter of Elian's life and let this family go in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, hailed by President Clinton and denounced by
Cuban-American exile leaders, marked a major milestone in the
extraordinary saga of a child who effectively became a pawn in an
international custody battle after he was rescued at sea last
November off the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother, Elisabeth, and 10 others who had fled with him
from Cuba died when their small boat capsized before fishermen
found the boy clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heartbroken,'' one of his rescuers, Donato Dalrymple, said
of the court ruling. Dalrymple, who lifted Elian from the inner
tube, was clutching the boy in April when federal agents seized the
child at gunpoint from the home of his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep fighting for the liberty of Elian,'' said
the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   While Elian lived with his relatives in Miami's Little Havana,
court papers were filed to make him the youngest refugee to seek an
asylum hearing in the United States without a parent's consent. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service denied the request, and the
appeals court upheld the decision, despite concerns about returning
Elian to ``a country with little respect for human rights and basic
freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the INS based its decision on an ``imperfect'' policy,
the decision fell ``within the outside border of reasonable
choices,'' the appeals panel wrote in a 33-page decision.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said ``reasonable people can disagree'' about the INS
decisions, which Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno refused to
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, the choices were not unreasonable, not capricious and
not arbitrary, but were reasoned and reasonable,'' the judges
wrote. ``The INS's considerable discretion was not abused.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, traveling in Europe, said the court ruling affirmed his
position that the case is ``about the importance of family and the
bond between a father and son.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Reno told reporters, ``We have said all along
that Elian belongs with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. Today's
ruling affirms that view.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision also reverberated in the 2000 presidential
campaign, as Vice President Al Gore, stumping in Atlanta,
reiterated that he wants a family court to decide the case. His
position, favored by Elian's Miami relatives, is at odds with the
Clinton administration's.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Nevada, Texas Governor George W. Bush called on
Gore to press Clinton for a family court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, where the case stirred emotions for months and the
community is still struggling to deal with the ethnic rifts it
created, reaction to the ruling was muted.
</P>
<P>
   A small crowd gathered at the home where Elian had lived in
Little Havana, even though his relatives have already moved to
another neighborhood. Spanish-language talk radio dissected the
court decision in regularly scheduled programs, but shows on health
and lawn care went on uninterrupted, unlike the saturation coverage
of earlier developments in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Clergy scheduled special Masses for Thursday night and called
for prayer. Otherwise, there was disappointment, but no recurrence
of the scattered violence that erupted after the predawn raid in
which Elian was seized.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case that has been defined by miracles as well as
heartbreak, this is a painful moment,'' said Kendall Coffey, a
former US attorney who is part of the legal team for Elian's Miami
relatives. ``While we may disagree with the ruling, it feels very
good to be in the court system of this country rather than in what
passes for justice 90 miles from our shores.''
</P>
<P>
   In a minor victory for the Miami relatives, the court denied a
motion by Elian's father to replace Lazaro as the child's
representative in the asylum case. Giving Juan Miguel such status
would have allowed the father to withdraw the asylum request and
immediately return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notwithstanding that much has happened since Lazaro brought
this suit,'' the judges concluded, ``we see no powerful reason to
make a change at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro and his daughter, Marisleysis Gonzalez, said they will
continue to try to see Elian, who is staying with his father at a
home in Washington that is protected around the clock by federal
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis, who became Elian's primary caregiver in the United
States before the INS raid, said she had called to talk to Elian
this week, but the mother of the boy's schoolmate who answered the
phone refused to let her talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis, whose emotional reaction to the INS raid was
televised worldwide, Thursday was calm and dry-eyed at a news
conference held near Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have faith,'' she said. ``I will keep my faith and I
think the battle isn't over yet. He's still here. He's still in
this great country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elian's father longs for his stay to end quickly. ``I love
him very much,'' Juan Miguel said, ``and I would hope that this
would come to an end and I can finally go back home together with
my son and my whole family.''

   NEW YORK _ Time, which Tito Puente could make throb, pulsate,
swivel, shake, exultate and finally, in the pounding rhythms of
mambo, cross over from the barrio in Harlem to the Palladium in
midtown Manhattan and onto the airways of America, caught up with
the legendary band leader and percussionist late Wednesday night,
when he died at age 77.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered complications after open heart surgery at New York
University Medical Center, his manager, Eddie Rodriguez, said.
</P>
<P>
   The man known as El Rey, the king, who put Mambo on the map _
and who came to be nearly as much a symbol of New York City as
Yankee Stadium _ had been scheduled to perform at a benefit
Wednesday evening at Christie's auction house.
</P>
<P>
   The most important Latin musician of the last half century and a
key figure in the fusion of Latin music with jazz, Puente was an
ebullient performer who often mugged and laughed as he whapped away
on his timbales.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else have I got to sell?'' he said a few months ago when
asked about this style. ``I'm not Ricky Martin, to wave my hips
around and show my belly button. I don't have a girl in front of
the band singing. I need the people to see I'm having a good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Known to the youngest of his fans as the man who wrote Carlos
Santana's hit ``Oye Como Va,''or perhaps from the 1992 movie ``The
Mambo Kings,'' in which he played himself, Puente had a career that
spanned five decades.
</P>
<P>
   There were few jazz stars from the be-bop era and beyond who did
not find him a compatible playing companion, and he was a staple of
the old Salsa Meets Jazz series at the Village Gate nightclub in
Manhattan and the JVC Jazz Festival, where he often stole the show
from more conventional jazz players.
</P>
<P>
   While many jazz groups added jazz sounds to Latin rhythms,
Puente liked to add a Latin rhythm section to a straight jazz
arrangement. A fine showman, he was not beyond gimmicks like
recording Dave Brubeck's ``Take Five'' in four-four time. He was
also tireless; even in recent years he worked between 200 and 300
performances a year.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Puente at the beginning of his career, bringing Latin
music to a new audience at the Palladium on Broadway at 53rd
Street, that made many grow nostalgic Thursday at the news of
Puente's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave us all a life,'' said Robert Farris Thompson, a
professor at Yale University, where Puente had been awarded a Chubb
Fellowship earlier this year, ``And by us I mean not only Puerto
Ricans, but mainland blacks, huge numbers of Italians and Jews. We
all loved him. There were guys my age who were envious they weren't
at the Moulin Rouge in the days of Toulouse-Lautrec; who weren't at
Minton's in the days of the birth of bop. I was secure in the
knowledge that I had been there on the birth of New York mambo.''
</P>
<P>
   Puente's personal life was not tame. During World War II, on
leave, he married a longtime girlfriend, Mirta Sanchez. In 1947,
they had a son, Ronald. The marriage ended in divorce. Today, both
live in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, Puente had a longtime relationship with Ida
Carlini, a dancer, now living in Miami, who says she met Puente at
The Palladium as a girl of 15. (``An Abby Lane type, gorgeous,''
one Palladium regular recalls.) Their son, Richard Anthony Puente,
was born in 1953. He became a musician.
</P>
<P>
   There followed a 30-year relationship with the former Margaret
Acencio, with whom Puente had a son, Tito Puente Jr., a musician,
and a daughter, Audrey Puente, a television weather forecaster in
New York. He and his wife were married, Puente told The New York
Times, ``four or five years'' ago, with their 28-year-old son and
30-year-old daughter serving as their parents' best man and best
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not taken a vacation in my whole life,'' Puente said in
that conversation, four months ago. ``Let me ask you a question:
Have you ever known a musician to take a vacation? You know when
you're on vacation? When the phone don't ring.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A musician who often said that he was ``born in rhythm,'' Ernest
Anthony Puente was born on April 20, 1923, at Harlem Hospital and
grew up on 110th Street, off Madison Avenue, in the neighborhood
then known as Spanish Harlem, or the barrio. Both his parents were
immigrants from Puerto Rico; his father worked in a razor blade
factory and there was a younger sister and a younger brother. Life
was not easy: his father, Puente said in an interview in The New
York Times last April, was a gambler, and his brother died at 4, in
a fall from the fire escape.
</P>
<P>
   The young Tito was a drummer from the time he could remember,
drumming so loudly and so often, on the kitchen table, with pots
and pans, that the neighbors beseeched his mother to get her son
music lessons. She did, though to get the 25 cents a lesson she
needed, she had to go through her husband's pockets for money when
he was asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Puente studied piano, then drums, then timbales _ a rack-mounted
setup of drums, cowbell, woodblock and other percussion
instruments, which provide crisp upper-register rhythms for Latin
bands. He also toyed with the idea of becoming a dancer, performing
in the neighborhood with his sister, Anna, before either was in
their teens. They performed ballroom, acrobatic, tap, heavily
influence by the dance idols of the day, Fred Astaire and Gene
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   But the music took precedence. Puente's big break came in the
'40s, when the United States entered the war. The drummer from the
Machito Orchestra, one of the first bands to fuse jazz and Latin
music, was drafted, and Puente took his place. At 13, he was a
professional. A few years later, Puente dropped out of high school;
the band, he would say years later, would provide schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Puente served in the Navy during World War II. He served in nine
battles, later receiving a presidential commendation.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Puente studied at the Juilliard School of Music
under the GI Bill. But the school's emphasis on classical music
made him restless. In 1948, he started his own band, the Piccadilly
Boys. Later, saying he did not want a band the name of which could
be confused with something on the menu (picadillo is a meat and
potato hash), he changed the name to the Tito Puente Orchestra. His
early distinctive touch, putting percussion in front, happened by
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pretty boys were always in front, the percussion always in
the back,'' Puente said in an interview with The Toronto Star.
``But the frontman needed to get their rhythm cues from the
percussion and someone suggested putting the rhythm in front
instead. Now everyone does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Puente's first hit, Abaniquito, came one year later. By the
early '50s, the band had become the Tito Puente Orchestra and was
packing them in at New York's Palladium. Mambo was king and Tito
Puente was king of mambo, recording dance favorites such as
``Barbarabatiri.'' ``El Rey del Timbai'' and ``Mambo Gallego.'' In
the late '50s, Puente was fusing cha-cha _ the hot Latin crossover
dance of the Catskills _ with big band compositions.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, Puente began to collaborate with other New York
musicians, including Celia Cruz, who would become the queen of
Latin Music to his king, with the trombonist Buddy Morrow, with
Woody Herman. In 1963 he recorded ``Oye Como Va'' which 12 years
later would be a hit song for Carlos Santana, and still later, a
running joke with Puente, who often publicly thanked Santana for
his royalties. In 1968, Puente had his own television show, on
Hispanic television, ``The World of Tito Puente.''
</P>
<P>
   The '70s were a down time for Puente.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a boogaloo era, and there were some other
nonmusical fads, and he had to do things to keep up with the Jones
that were not so good for his records,'' said Johnny Rodriguez,
Puente's longtime road manager. But in the '80s, and particularly
in the '90s, he was coming back. He recorded with such jazz
musicians as Phil Woods, George Shearing, James Moody, Dave
Valentin, Hilton Ruiz and Terry Gibbs; he and his band often
performed with symphony orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   He also became a sort of symbol of the New York Puerto Rican
identity, marching prominently in Puerto Rican parades. In 1995,
Puente opened a popular 250-seat restaurant on City Island, the
maritime enclave just off the coast of the Bronx. It featured a
Caribbean-Hispanic menu with Puerto Rican specialties and, of
course, Latin jazz.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, President Clinton recalled his remarks
when he gave Puente the National Medal of Arts in 1997. ``Just
hearing Tito Puente's name makes you want to get up and dance,''
Clinton said then.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar Hijuelos novel, ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of
Love,'' which became a film in 1992, ``The Mambo Kings,'' offered
sweet vindication. In that story two Cuban brothers move to New
York in the '50s and form a mambo band; Puente is portrayed as the
king, the center of the mambo universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought playing in those place, writing that music,
experiencing it all, that there would be a movie of it,'' Puente
said in The Times. ``It's a place and time that has really been
overlooked. So this now comes out and I feel good about it. This
will help get out music around the world.''

BUSH DELAYS AN EXECUTION FOR THE 1ST TIME IN 5 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANK BRUNI with RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ In a step he had never taken over the
course of 131 executions in five years, Gov. George W. Bush
Thursday night agreed to a 30-day reprieve for a death-row inmate
in Texas, citing concerns that adequate tests on DNA evidence in
the case had not been performed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his decision, which he had telegraphed well in
advance, after both the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and the
U.S. Supreme Court late Thursday rejected final-hour pleas by
lawyers for the inmate, Ricky Nolen McGinn, who had been scheduled
for execution by lethal injection at 6 p.m. Central time.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn was convicted of raping and killing his 12-year-old
stepdaughter in 1993, but Bush acknowledged over recent days that
the DNA evidence connecting McGinn to the rape was inconclusive and
might be clarified by modern tests. It was the rape, layered on top
of the murder, that qualified McGinn for a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who had just arrived at the state capitol building here
for a conference of governors, announced the stay only about 15
minutes before the originally scheduled time for McGinn's
execution. Bush noted that the actual reprieve would be granted by
Texas state Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat who was
technically acting as governor while Bush and the lieutenant
governor were both out of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have recommended and Senator Ellis has accepted my
recommendation to grant a 30-day reprieve in the case of Mr.
McGinn,'' Bush told a group of reporters who huddled around him in
a corridor of the state capitol building here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime DNA evidence can be used in its context and be
relevant as to the guilt or innocence of a person on death row, we
need to use it,'' Bush explained, in a straightforward, unemotional
voice. ``We're doing so in the state of Texas. I expect the courts
and all relevant parties to act expeditiously to review the
evidence and to finally determine his innocence or guilt as to the
charge of rape in the case of Ricky McGinn.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Bush is now the presumptive Republican nominee for
president, his actions as governor are under more intense scrutiny
_ none more so than his vigorous enforcement of the death penalty.
Texas easily leads the nation in executions.
</P>
<P>
   Although his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, also
supports capital punishment, some of his allies would like to use
the issue to cast doubt on Bush's efforts to portray himself as a
``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Bush's unusual action in the case of McGinn
underscored the way in which modern DNA testing and technology have
begun to affect the debate over capital punishment by casting doubt
on convictions once considered solid and just.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, even some staunch conservatives have begun to
acknowledge qualms about capital punishment, in light of a number
of death sentences that have been overturned recently after DNA
testing exonerated the inmates. How these developments will
ultimately affect public support for the death penalty, which has
been broad and strong and often independent of political party
affiliation, remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said that his action was not even remotely
influenced by politics and noted that he had made many tough and
unpopular decisions about the death penalty in the past, including
several since he declared his candidacy for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush's only independent authority is to grant a
30-day reprieve of an execution. He cannot pardon someone or
commute a death sentence without the prior recommendation of the
Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and, under those circumstances,
has commuted only one death sentence over the last year, sparing
the life of Henry Lee Lucas, a confessed serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, as in this one, the argument against the death
penalty was not a sentimental but an evidentiary one, with
questions emerging about some of the testimony and material
marshaled to establish the defendants' guilt and seal the
particular conviction for which he received his death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the first time that Bush agreed to a reprieve for a
death-row inmate, and he did it against the wishes of the pardons
board, which had voted 11-7 not to stay McGinn's execution. For the
moment, Bush's action merely delays McGinn's execution, although
his lawyers hope that they can now perform new DNA tests that will
shed new doubt on McGinn's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   What Bush did Thursday, and the way in which he presaged it with
a series of remarks on Wednesday, suggested that he was at least
somewhat sensitive to his image as an especially fervent advocate
of capital punishment and pleased to happen upon a case that
allowed him to temper it.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Bush had almost always waited for courts to
complete their reviews of death-row inmates' appeals before he
signaled his own intentions or thinking on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush broke from that pattern this time around, gladly
telling reporters on Wednesday that he was likely to grant McGinn a
30-day reprieve. At the time, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
had yet to rule on the issue, and McGinn's lawyers had not turned
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican political strategists around the country said
that they doubted Bush was simply trying to soften his image by
showing a capacity for clemency. They noted that public support for
capital punishment still runs high and that Bush three years ago
declined to grant a reprieve in a much showier, more widely covered
case: that of a woman named Karla Faye Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that this is political,'' said Mike Murphy, who
was the principal strategist for Sen. John McCain's presidential
campaign. But, Murphy added, ``The truth is that the explosion in
DNA technology has really changed the death penalty dynamic, and
perhaps he's taking that reality into account a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen P. Hughes, a spokesman for Bush, said Thursday afternoon
that McGinn's case was the first one Bush has faced as governor in
which the possibility of further DNA testing was so central to the
question of innocence or guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DNA testing at the trial level was inconclusive and
there's an opportunity to get more information now from that test,
so he feels it's the right thing to do,'' Hughes said. ``These are
life and death decisions, and Governor Bush makes them based on
principle.''

</P>
<P>
   The fate of McGinn from this point on remains unclear, because
his lawyers are in waters largely uncharted in Texas. They must
obtain the evidence they want tested, including clothing from the
victim that contained a semen stain and a pubic hair found on the
victim's body, and then analyze the DNA. But they said Thursday
that they are not certain whether they have just 30 days to
complete this, or whether the case now returns to a state district
judge to set a new execution date, which would give the defense
team at least 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   If DNA tests show that the hair and semen were not from McGinn,
``obviously he's not guilty of rape and he can't be executed,''
said Barry Scheck, a DNA expert who joined McGinn's defense team
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' Scheck said, ``the DNA testing might link
him to other crimes. These are all things to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how the tests turn out, prosecutors say they
expect the murder conviction to stand because of other evidence
that tied McGinn to the girl's killing.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, murder is punishable by death only if the killing
occurred under certain specified circumstances, including the
murder of a police officer or fireman in the line of duty;
committing murder during a kidnapping, burglary, robbery, rape,
arson, or prison escape; murdering for money, or paying someone
else to do so; and murdering a child under the age of six.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the death penalty threshold was achieved when the
jury found McGinn had also raped his stepdaughter.

 &HT;    Court rejects hearing for Elian
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Elian Gonzalez will remain in this country for at
least three more weeks while attorneys for his Miami relatives
decide whether they want to continue the international custody
struggle in an Atlanta federal appeals court or the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban-American relatives lost another round Thursday, when
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled here that the
Immigration and Naturalization Service was within its legal rights
to deny Elian an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old shipwreck survivor's great-uncle had filed the
hearing petition against the wishes of the boy's father, his sole
surviving parent.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the ruling, attorneys for Elian's Miami
relatives asked the Supreme Court for an emergency temporary
injunction ``to assure that Elian will remain in the United
States'' while they prepare a petition asking the court for a
hearing. But they withdrew the request late Thursday afternoon when
they realized Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, cannot take the
boy back to Cuba for at least 21 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives have two weeks to file an appeal and then
another week before the appellate court's ruling will be finalized,
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said. Kendall Coffey, attorney for
the Miami family, said he hadn't decided on a course of action, but
Elian's relatives vowed not to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to keep fighting for Elian's freedom,'' said the
boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, with whom Elian lived for five
months after being rescued off the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster's mother and 10 others drowned when their boat
capsized after they fled Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has had his son with him in the
Washington, D.C., area since federal agents forcibly reunited them
in late April, pleaded with the Miami family to stop the legal
fight so he can take his family back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I have always felt most profoundly in my heart _ a
child simply should always be with his father,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish this would end once and for all _ to be able to leave,
return to my home with my son and my entire family and that this
delay will not continue unnecessarily,'' he said through an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about what happened today,'' said the father's
lawyer, Gregory Craig. ``This case has been decided, and in our
view there is no longer any doubt about the ultimate outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The court decided that because no federal law addresses whether
a child as young as Elian can seek asylum against the wishes of his
parents, the Immigration and Naturalization Service was required to
devise a policy dealing with the case's ``extraordinary
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges acknowledged Cuba violates human rights, but said the
INS, not the courts, should determine immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
   The court denied a request by Elian's father to replace Lazaro
Gonzalez as the boy's representative in the court proceedings, a
move that would have allowed Juan Miguel Gonzalez to drop the
asylum request and take his son back to Cuba immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit appeals court was the third court to reject the
Miami relatives' legal arguments. A three-judge panel on the court
unanimously affirmed a ruling by a federal judge in Miami, who had
concluded that federal immigration officials acted within their
broad legal powers when they decided that only Elian's father could
speak for him on the issue of asylum. A family court judge in Miami
also dismissed a custody petition filed by Elian's great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, who was rescued on Thanksgiving Day while clinging to an
inner tube off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, lived with his Miami
relatives until federal agents removed him in a predawn raid April
22. He was whisked that morning to Washington, where his father,
stepmother and baby brother had been waiting for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The custody battle took on international ramifications when
Cuban President Fidel Castro demanded Elian's return and marshaled
support from tens of thousands of angry Cubans. In Miami,
Cuban-Americans were equally adamant that Elian not be returned to
the Communist nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez filed the asylum petition, arguing Elian would
become traumatized if returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, the 11th Circuit panel of judges _ J.L.
Edmondson of Atlanta, Joel Dubina of Montgomery, Ala., and Charles
Wilson of Tampa _ ruled the INS acted legally in refusing an asylum
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS's considerable discretion was not abused,'' Edmondson
wrote for the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-page ruling did not focus on custody matters, but on the
narrower question of ``the separation of powers under our
constitutional system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the duty of the Congress and the executive branch to
exercise political will,'' the ruling said. ``Although courts
should not be unquestioning, we should respect the other branch's
policymaking powers. The judicial power is a limited power. It is
the duty of the judicial branch not to exercise political will, but
only to render judicial judgment under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have three options within the next two
weeks: Ask the three-judge panel to reconsider, request a hearing
before all 12 judges on the appeals court or turn to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it's unlikely the Supreme Court would give them the
solution they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut instinct is it's unlikely there will be a stay or a
(hearing) in this case,'' said University of Georgia law professor
Dan Coenen, who was a clerk for the late Justice Harry Blackmun in
1979 and 1980. ``These are highly discretionary matters and my gut
instinct may be wrong but my instinct is this is not likely to (be
heard by the Supreme Court).''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Beck, who was a law clerk for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
in 1990 and now teaches constitutional law at the University of
Georgia, said he doubted the Supreme Court would take the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They often say their job is not to correct errors in
individual cases,'' Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Reno hailed the appeals court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important step in achieving the goal we have
sought from the very beginning _ to give Juan Miguel and his family
the opportunity to return to a life together,'' Reno said. ``I am
hopeful that this matter will soon reach a final resolution so that
Elian, his father and the family may resume their lives away from
the scrutiny of the media and the uncertainty that the legal battle
has caused for his entire family.'' In Miami the ruling was met
with screams and cries of disappointment from protesters outside
the Little Havana home where Elian had lived.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Linar, a 40-year-old homemaker, held a sign with a photo
of Elian and his mother. ``It is not over yet,'' Linar said. ``God
is with us.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the civil unrest that followed the April 22 raid,
Miami's streets were quiet Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard and difficult, but at least if people see this
was a legal process, it makes it somewhat different than April
22,'' Miami Mayor Joe Carollo said from City Hall. ``Everything's
quiet. I want to make sure the city remains peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatives held out some hope that Elian's father still would
be stopped from taking him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the laws of this country favor him and give him the
opportunity to seek asylum,'' said Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's
cousin, who has described herself as a surrogate mother.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hopes the courts will force Elian's father to allow
her family to visit the boy, whom they have not seen since the
April 22 raid.

<P>
   Using a new kind of stroke rehabilitation therapy, scientists
have shown for the first time that the brain can be coaxed into
reorganizing its circuitry so that people can regain nearly full
use of their paralyzed limbs in just two to three weeks, even if
the stroke happened years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitation, called constraint-induced-movement therapy,
involves immobilizing a good arm or leg so that the patient is
forced to use the paralyzed arm or leg for familiar tasks. By
intensively using the paralyzed limb, people can literally rewire
parts of their brains, researchers said, and overcome a kind of
learned helplessness that prevented their limbs from moving.
Moreover, the technique works for patients who had their strokes
even decades ago and have had limited use of their limbs ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, by scientists at the University of Alabama and the
Freidrich Schiller University of Jena in Germany, involved only the
arms of 13 patients, but the researchers say similar methods will
also work for paralyzed legs. Several studies are under way in an
effort to confirm the findings and test the theory that paralyzed
legs can also be restored.
</P>
<P>
   But the results involving the 13 patients, reported Friday in
the June issue of Stroke: Journal of the American Heart
Association, join a growing body of evidence that the adult brain
is capable of reorganizing itself after injury. The newly reported
study made maps of an area of the brain in the 13 chronic stroke
patients before and after the intensive therapy. Researchers found
that the area, which was responsible for arm movements on the
injured side of the brain, had nearly doubled in size after the
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The therapy only works, researchers said, if it is given six
hours a day for at least two weeks. When similarly intense therapy
is offered only two or three days a week, they said, the brain is
not sufficiently stimulated to reorganize itself.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Larry Goldstein, a professor at Duke University Medical
Center in Durham, N.C., and an expert on stroke, said it was too
soon to say whether the new approach would find widespread use.
While the study is interesting, Goldstein said, it has some ``big
limitations,'' in that it is based on a very small number of
patients who were not compared to a control group. ``Is it
promising?'' he asked. ``Yes. Is it proven? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Four million people now live with the effects of stroke,
two-thirds of whom are moderately or severely impaired.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that an adult brain can rewire itself after injury has
been shown in animals for over 50 years, said Dr. Edward Taub, a
neurologist at the University of Alabama in Birmingham and an
author of the study. This led researchers to wonder if ways could
be found to promote such rewiring in human stroke patients.
</P>
<P>
   After a stroke, some cells die but many more are left in a state
of shock, Taub said. Sometimes these stunned cells recover
spontaneously and the patient gets better. But more often, the
cells, which might make up networks that control limb movements,
remain stunned, in a state of permanent inhibition. Every time a
patient tries to use his bad arm and fails, Taub said, the failure
is reinforced. The ability to move gets suppressed, in a kind of
learned helplessness.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to move has not been abolished, he said, but the
patient has given up trying. Meanwhile, Taub said, patients start
to depend on their good arms to carry out everyday tasks and those
movements are similarly reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   This state of affairs is reflected in brain organization. For
example, cellular networks responsible for arm movements on the
injured side of the brain will often shrink by 70 percent whereas
the same networks on the uninjured side will expand in size, though
not as much.
</P>
<P>
   To see if injured networks can be made to expand, Taub and his
colleagues came up with what they called
constraint-induced-movement therapy.  &QL; 
It involves strapping down a patient's good arm and forcing the bad
arm to do all the work. This, they reasoned, should force the brain
to give up its learned helplessness.
</P>
<P>
   The therapy worked, Taub said. About 250 patients have been
treated in several research laboratories nationwide with excellent
results, he said. The National Institute of Health is about to
begin clinical trials of the therapy. Many other studies of the
therapy are now under way, Taub said.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 men and women in Taub's study had an arm paralyzed from
strokes suffered from six months to 17 years ago. Before the
therapy, these patients had their brains mapped with a special
magnetic device that detects the area of the brain where various
muscles are represented. The researchers made maps of the small
muscle that connects the thumb to the rest of the hand and used it
as a surrogate for the paralyzed arm. If the representation of this
muscle could be made to expand in the brain, Taub said, all the
stimulated arm muscles should also expand. Before therapy, the
thumb muscle of paralyzed patients showed activity at only 12
positions on the magnetic map, Taub said. A normal thumb muscle
might show up to 30 active positions.
</P>
<P>
   During the therapy, patients had their good arms secured in a
splint and sling for 90 percent of their waking hours. They went to
the rehabilitation laboratory for eight weekdays of treatment,
lasting six hours each day. In therapy, they practiced tiny
movements that would allow them to reach out, grasp and move
objects.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the training ended, the patients' brains were
remapped. The thumb muscles on their paralyzed sides showed an
average of 22 active positions, nearly double the earlier number,
Taub said. The patients regained three-quarters of the normal use
of their paralyzed arms in just two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greatly increased use of the paralyzed arm is what drives the
brain to change, Taub said. It is not enough to tie down the good
arm. Six months after therapy the patients brains were remapped and
the changes appeared to be permanent, he said. The researchers do
not know if even more therapy would result in complete use of the
arm.

CLINTON SAYS MIDEAST PEACE AGREEMENT `WITHIN VIEW NOW' 

</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal _ President Clinton, diving back personally
into the Middle East peace negotiations, expressed confidence
Thursday that Israeli and Palestinian leaders can reach a final
agreement by their September deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tough work,'' Clinton said after a 90-minute meeting
here with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel. ``But, actually, it
is within view now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he remained ``convinced'' that Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ``have the courage, the vision and
the ability to do this, and the United States will do everything we
can to help them pass this milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House again held out the prospect of a Middle East
summit in the United States when the two sides were closer to a
comprehensive settlement, if such a meeting could help get them
reach a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The stir in the peace process was occasioned by Israel's
withdrawal from Lebanon, but a senior administration official
cautioned that ``moments don't last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak complained to Clinton and to reporters that Arafat has
been stalling the talks. ``In recent weeks, we have seen some
dragging of feet in regard to the running of negotiations,'' he
said. But Arafat charged that the delays were the fault of the
Israelis
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would meet soon with Arafat in Washington. That
session is probably at least a week away. Clinton arrives home from
his European journey late Monday and leaves Tuesday for a quick
trip to Japan for a memorial service for the late Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
will travel to the Middle East next week ``to work with Barak and
Arafat ``on narrowing the gaps that still remain between them.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said Albright is likely to make
at least one more trip to the region before a U.S.-sponsored summit
was seriously considered. Such a session would likely be styled
after the Camp David sessions in the late 1970s that resulted in
the breakthrough peace deal between Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the official left little doubt that they believe a
Middle East endgame is again at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with the most fateful issues there are between
Israelis and Palestinians,'' the U.S. official said. ``The issues
of permanent status, borders, settlements, refugees, Jerusalem,
security agreements. All of these issues go to the heart of
identity, existence and security, and these are very tough
negotiations, to be sure, given how profound the issues are.''
</P>
<P>
   The official refused to offer details on any of the negotiating
points, including reports that Israel was prepared to consider
handing over up to 90 percent of the West Bank to Arafat's
Palestinians, up from the earlier 60 percent thought to be on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that both sides have signaled to each other and to
us that they're prepared to try to take into account the needs of
the other, as well as meeting their own needs,'' the senior
official said. ``If you're going to reach a deal, you're going to
have to make some painful decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Barak ``reaffirmed his intense commitment'' to
reach a complete agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Clinton met for about 90 minutes in the president's
hotel in the Portuguese capital before Clinton flew on to Berlin on
the second leg of his week-long European trip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spoke by telephone with Arafat on Wednesday after
announcing the Barak session, said the Palestinian leader ``shares
this commitment and ... recognizes the real urgency of this moment
to actually get back on the timetable and complete the work that
has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat have set a deadline of Sept. 13 for having a
final agreement, although negotiations in much of the last six
months have been slow-going. Nonetheless, the president believes
the deadline can be met, the senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials conceded that any progress in the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is not matched on the separate
Israeli-Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
   But aides traveling in Europe with Clinton refused to rule out
anything, in light of Israel's withdrawal of its military units
from Lebanon after 18 years of occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how you slice it, in the Middle East there is a new
reality,'' said a senior administration official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``Israel is out of Lebanon.'' The act not
only fulfills the demands of a U.N. resolution but also ``shows
that something like this, which many thought couldn't happen, can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The official confirmed that the United States had approved use
of $50 million in funding to allow Israel to shore up its northern
border with Lebanon, a historic flash point in the region. The
approval comes with an allowance for Israel to use domestic
contractors rather than the usual process of employing U.S. firms.

GORE AND BUSH HEDGE ON RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CUBAN-BOY and CUBAN-BOY-ASSESS) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Conservatives condemned and liberals applauded the
court decision Thursday denying Elian Gonzalez an asylum hearing,
while the two politicians most prominently seeking support in the
political center _ Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas _ temporized.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Smith, R-N.H., called it ``a sad judgment and a
tragedy for this little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of
Churches, said, ``Our only disappointment is that it didn't happen
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither Bush nor Gore would say whether they thought the
decision was good or bad. Gore said that it should be
``respected,'' but that he had always believed a Florida family
court should have dealt with the case. Bush said that he believed
the same thing, and that Gore should now persuade Attorney General
Janet Reno to send the case there. Reno made it clear that she had
no such plans, saying, ``I think justice has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Each presidential hopeful had reasons for hedging. Conservative
Republicans who had demanded an investigation and hearings when
Elian, the 6-year-old Cuban boy, was forceably taken from the house
of his great-uncle on April 22 quickly retreated when it was clear
the public supported the government's action.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore's split with the administration was widely condemned in
his own party as pandering to Cuban-American voters in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another level at which the decision defies
ideological pigeonholing. While the result disappoints
conservatives like Smith and Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority
whip, it is a statement of judicial restraint, a staple
conservative principle.
</P>
<P>
   At least 11 times, the opinion by Judge J.L. Edmondson of the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals suggested that the Immigration
and Naturalization Service might have made wrong decisions in the
case. But, Edmondson wrote, it was not the job of judges to
overturn the policy ``selected by the INS merely because we
personally might have chosen another.''
</P>
<P>
   The opinion, in language that could come from any Republican
platform of the last 20 years, concluded: ``It is the duty of the
Congress and of the executive branch to exercise political will.
Although courts should not be unquestioning, we should respect the
other branches' policy making powers. The judicial power is a
limited power. It is the duty of the judicial branch not to
exercise political will, but only to render judgment under the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberals' pleasure at the result was tempered by just that
element of deference, because many important immigration cases
challenge deportations, and seek to require courts to oversee INS
decisions to a degree this opinion clearly bars.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Florida, said the decision was not surprising. ``This,''
Simon said, ``is the consequence of Congress giving so much
discretion to the immigration service and the Department of
Justice,'' a degree of discretion the ACLU found excessive when the
1996 Immigration Act denied judicial review to aliens the INS found
deportable.
</P>
<P>
   T. Alexander Aleinikoff, professor of law at the Georgetown
University Law School, praised the decision for reaching a proper
standard of judicial review of administrative decisions by the
executive branch. But Aleinikoff said, ``We seem to always go
further in immigration cases where there is an extra dose of
deference that is given.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the court probably went further than this case demanded
in emphasizing how immigration policy affected ``the president's
conduct of our nation's international affairs,'' and in brushing
off the complaint that the INS denied Elian and his Miami relatives
due process.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the political reaction Thursday focused on the
result of the decision, and not its legal logic, DeLay cited due
process. ``Elian Gonzalez should, at a minimum, have his case for
asylum fully heard and objectively considered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said, ``The court correctly found
that the INS acted within its discretion in deciding that it is the
role of parents to care for and make decisions for their young
children in all but the rarest circumstances.''

 &HT;    Father believes shooting was accidental
 &HT;    By Scott McCabe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ Police are backing away from charging a
75-year-old man with failing to properly lock up the pistol they
say Nathaniel Brazill used to kill his popular seventh-grade
teacher last week.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Worth police had said Tuesday they planned to ask
prosecutors to charge Elmore ``Granny'' McCray, the father of the
godmother of the 13-year-old Brazill, with the misdemeanor of
failing to safely store a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than recommend charges, investigators Thursday simply
asked the State Attorney's Office to review their findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of our hands,'' Lake Worth police Detective Lt. Paul
Patti said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Thursday, Brazill's father, Nathaniel Brazill Sr. of
Orlando, said on ``Good Morning America,'' that he believes his son
accidentally shot and killed Lake Worth Middle School teacher Barry
Grunow with the gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, we just don't believe that Nate pulled the trigger. The
gun came out and accidentally went off,'' the father said.
</P>
<P>
   But police Lt. Raychel Houston said Thursday that Brazill
``racked a round'' into the semi-automatic gun's chamber while he
was talking to Grunow and before he fired the gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't have charged him with first-degree homicide if
they thought it was an accident,'' she said of the department's
request for that charge to the state attorney's office. She said
they made the decision based on a security-camera tape of the
shooting, witnesses' statements and the rounds from the gun _ one
live and one spent _ found near Grunow's body.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney spokesman Mike Edmondson declined comment
Thursday about McCray's case.
</P>
<P>
   Any criminal charge against McCray hinges on proving the gun was
loaded at the time Brazill took it.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill told police he loaded the .25-caliber Raven pistol
himself after finding it in a tin box in a dresser drawer at
McCray's home. Brazill found bullets in the dresser drawer as well,
Houston said. McCray also told police the gun was not loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The misdemeanor law also says a gun owner must keep the weapon
secure if he or she ``knows or reasonably should know that a minor
is likely to gain access to the firearm.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, police thought Brazill regularly stayed
with McCray and that McCray should have known Brazill might find
it. But they recently learned Brazill didn't often stay there,
although he did stay there just two days before the shooting. His
mother, Polly Powell, said Thursday that Brazill returned to her
home May 24 after staying there about five days while she was in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Worth police also said Thursday they have obtained three
warrants in the last two days, including one to search Brazill's
home again. The second search is not because of any new
developments but just to make sure they didn't miss anything,
Houston said. On Sunday, Brazill's mother, had allowed police to
take Brazill's computer and reams of web page printouts, many that
dealt with military weaponry, helicopters and handwritten notes.
</P>
<P>
   With the second of the three warrants, the FBI Thursday began
examining data from Brazill's Gateway computer and CD-ROM games.
The third was to obtain records from Brazill's Internet service
provider.
</P>
<P>
   Police found war games, but none, so far, of the gruesome,
first-person based video games like ``Doom'' and ``Quake,'' Patti
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney Barry Krischer has moved to seal the warrants and
information about any items seized by police.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials are still working overtime to present
a murder case against Brazill to the grand jury by June 15. Grunow
was killed Friday at Lake Worth Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   Krischer has said he hopes to convince the grand jury to charge
Brazill as an adult. The county's state attorney said on
``Nightline'' Wednesday night that if Brazill was tried as a
juvenile he could only serve 18 to 36 months in a lockdown
facility, and would probably get out early because he is an honor
student. ``So within two years he'd be home, out on the street,
merely under the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice.
And that is not justice for the family of Barry Grunow,'' Krischer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ziedenberg, senior policy analyst for the Justice Policy
Institution in Washington D.C., which advocates alternatives to
imprisoning juveniles, said Krischer is wrong. He said that under
Florida law a juvenile judge can keep a child in custody until 21.
On his tour through South Florida Thursday, Gov. Jeb Bush said he
offered condolences to Barry Grunow's wife, Pam, earlier in the
week and has written a $100 personal check to the fund set up for
the family.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he remains opposed to mandatory trigger locks.
``People who are concerned about gun safety are going to put gun
locks on their guns.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that despite the shooting, ``schools are safer
today they they were 2 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure you legislate against tragic events like this.''

HOPES RISE FOR PALESTINIANS CAUGHT IN BORDER LIMBO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOHEIRA, Lebanon _ At the fence that marks the border with
Israel, two Palestinian sisters reached hands leathered by age
through coils of barbed wire and across decades of war and exile to
touch each other for the first time in 52 years.
</P>
<P>
   One sister was among thousands of Palestinian refugees in
Lebanon who crowded the border this week to see the land and the
families she left behind after Israel's triumph in the 1948 war.
Until Israel abruptly withdrew its troops and ended its occupation
in south Lebanon 10 days ago, the sisters had been unable to get
even this close for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   By the United Nations' count, there are 360,000 Palestinians in
Lebanon, and most still live in the squalor of refugee camps. For
more than a half century, they have been caught between Lebanon,
which does not want them, and Israel, which refuses to allow their
return.
</P>
<P>
   With the dramatic Israeli pullback from south Lebanon, hope for
Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homeland has been
rekindled. But so have fears that Palestinian frustrations will
reignite in the refugee camps and result in the kind of
Syrian-backed, cross-border attacks that first prompted the Jewish
state to invade Lebanon in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Up a steep cliff along the border fence, Miriam Mousa, 65, stood
on a narrow gravel strip Tuesday and came agonizingly close to her
sister, Dania, and other family members torn from her after she
fled her Palestinian village at the age of 13 during the 1948 war.
She ended up in Lebanon, but the rest of her family remained in the
former Palestine, most of which became the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was alone here for all this time. All my family was in
Palestine. Look. Look at them. This is my sister, this is my
brother,'' she said, wiping away tears. ``My God, I have been
praying to see them for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   She was among roughly 100 Palestinian refugees standing on the
Lebanon side of the fence while her family and about 100 other
Palestinians who live in what is now Israel gathered on the Israeli
side. All were shouting and some wept as they tried to find
relatives and friends separated during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The men shook hands and the women embraced through the
barbed-wire fence. Israeli soldiers eventually began separating
them, uncoiling a new roll of barbed wire to secure the border. But
the families continued shouting messages even as they were pushed
back from the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Itaf, the daughter of Rigan,'' an elderly woman yelled
from the Israeli side. ``Who are you? Do you know me?''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, there came a scream from the other side. It was a
cousin whom she had not seen since they were children.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did this happen to us?'' the elderly woman cried out.
</P>
<P>
   She turned away, crying and repeating the phrase: ``How did this
happen to us?''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's 22 years of occupation in south Lebanon kept the pair
from reuniting at the border. And for the 30 years before that,
Lebanon's restrictions on Palestinian refugees kept most
Palestinians from being able to travel to the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the border area open to them, the older Palestinians
stand heartbreakingly close to the land where they were born. And
for the younger generation, it is a first chance to see the land of
family lore.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of anger and yearning is powerfully felt in Ain el
Hilwe, the largest of 12 Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. The
refugees in the teeming UN camp direct their anger not only at
Israel, but also at Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, who they
say has not applied enough pressure on the issue of ``right of
return'' for refugees in the final phase of a six-year peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 3.5 million Palestinians registered as
refugees by the UN Relief and Works Agency. Most live along
Israel's borders in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. One-third, or about 1.2 million, still live in a
string of 59 ramshackle refugee camps in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our own leaders have forgotten us,'' said Abed Makdah, 56, who
said he was 4 years old when his family fled the village of El
Ghabbisiya near the coastal town of Akko and came to Lebanon, where
he lives in Ain el Hilwe.
</P>
<P>
   Makdah, secretary general of the camp's Popular Committee, a
form of self-rule, adds, ``They speak only of the refugees' right
of return in words, not deeds. Where do they think we are supposed
to go at the end of the peace process? Do they think we can just
disappear?''
</P>
<P>
   The heavily armed Palestinian factions in the refugee camps see
the Shiite Muslim militia's guerrilla war against Israeli
occupation as proof that military resistance is the only way to
achieve their goals. At a massive rally celebrating Israel's
pullout, Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Islamic Hezbollah
organization that fought the guerrilla war against Israeli troops,
encouraged the Palestinians to model fighting units on Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Such calls to arms by dozens of factions and splinter groups in
camps like Ain el Hilwe deeply trouble analysts here, who fear that
neighboring Syria, with 30,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, could
help arm the guerrillas in order to put pressure on Israel to
return the Golan Heights. Israel's negotiations with Syria broke
down six months ago, and Israel's proposals to withdraw from Golan,
which it captured from Syria in 1967, are considered to have been
shelved for the forseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Rearming the Palestinian militias is also a scenario that
troubles the Lebanese, many of whom believe that the Palestinian
fighters dragged their country into a 15-year civil war that killed
70,000 people by the time it ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have no civil rights in Lebanon. They live in the
camps, where unemployment soars up to 70 percent. Young people,
some of whom are fourth-generation refugees, know nothing but
despair and dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lebanon cannot keep the refugees for a set of reasons that are
both political and economic,'' said Simon Karam, Lebanon's
ambassador to Washington in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, keeping the refugees is impossible because
naturalizing them would do great harm to the demographic balance of
Muslims and Christians in Lebanon,'' he said. ``And economically,
it can't afford to shut down these refugee camps. Where would these
people be housed, where would they work? It is an untenable
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance to the teeming city of about 65,000 refugees who
live in the Ain el Heliwe refugee camp, a Palestinian teenager with
a machine gun was waiting to take a reporter to the ``colonel,'' a
longtime Palestinian resistance fighter named Mounir Moqdah.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the maze of litter-strewn alleys of the camp, the young
man ducked into a small metal door that led to a courtyard where
Moqdah, a fugitive from Lebanese and Israeli intelligence agencies,
has his headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The bearded, 40-year-old, self-proclaimed ``colonel'' of Fatah,
the largest political faction within the Palestine Liberation
Organization, was dressed in a camouflage uniform and leather
sandals, lounging on a couch. A rocket-propelled antitank grenade
launcher rested against a wall mural of the Jerusalem skyline and
the Muslim shrine of the Dome of the Rock mosque.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis only understand force,'' he said, blowing smoke
from a Rothman cigarette. ``We will have to force them to comply
with UN Resolution 194, just as they were forced to comply with
425.''
</P>
<P>
   UN Resolution 194 granted the right of return and compensation
to Palestinian refugees who fled or were forced to flee during the
1948 war. UN Resolution 425, passed in 1978, demanded that the
Israeli military completely withdraw from Lebanon. The UN is
expected this week to make its determination that Israel has
complied with the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah's victory has shown us that these long, drawn-out
negotiations are not what works,'' Moqdah said.

LAZIO   IS SOUNDING A LOT LIKE HIS OPPONENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. _ Listen to Rick Lazio laying out his beliefs
before a couple of hundred supporters in this upstate town, and if
you didn't know better, you might think he was the Democratic
candidate for Senate, not the Republican one.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the speech, in fact, if you shut your eyes and ears
and just read the transcript afterward, you could reasonably guess
the words were Hillary Rodham Clinton's, not her opponent's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure New York gets the very best, everything it
needs,'' Lazio pledged. And his list of needs includes clean water,
fresh air, affordable housing, first-rate public education, help
for the disabled, free cancer-screening for poor women, Medicare
subsidies for prescription drugs, ``high-tech incubators'' to rev
up the upstate economy _ themes right out of the Clinton-era
liberal's songbook.
</P>
<P>
   This was Lazio's message at the Republican State convention in
Buffalo on Tuesday, where the Long Island congressman was annointed
the party's last-minute nominee after an ailing Rudolph Giuliani
dropped out. And Lazio repeated the litany over and over on a
three-day bus tour across New York's heartland that kicked off his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He did emphasize two differences, though, and they are forming
the centerpiece of his campaign. First, he's a native New Yorker.
Second, he's not Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Getting most of Clinton's agenda without getting Clinton _ that
seems to be Lazio's pitch, and, judging from the reception so far,
in the polls and on his bus tour (he calls his bus ``The Mainstream
Express''), it seems to be striking a chord.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Rick Lazio wears a New York sports team hat, it actually
fits,'' Governor George Pataki bellowed at the Buffalo convention,
in a loudly cheered dig at Clinton's donning of a Yankees cap early
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Lazio doesn't have to spend weeks going around the state
in a bogus listening tour to find out what New Yorkers feel,''
Pataki went on. ``He's one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   On the road, Lazio drew wild applause with similar phrases:
``For me, New York isn't just a mailing address, it's my home. . .
. I'm one of you.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be a theme that carries to New York City, where many
people come from someplace else. But it resonates deeply upstate,
where distrust of outsiders has long been prevalent _ more so now,
when the region continues to languish economically while the rest
of the country, including New York City, soars.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours into Lazio's bus-tour, every sidewalk
spectator along the way was reciting the slogan. ``You're one of us
and that's important,'' said Bill Byrne, owner of a milk factory
that Lazio visited in Syracuse. ``He's one of us,'' said Frank
Condella, a retired policeman who heard him speak outside a winery
in Dundee. ``If you grow up in New York, you have a better idea of
what New Yorkers want,'' said Sean Mahony, a student in Corning.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview onboard his bus, Lazio connected the local-boy
refrain to another theme he will be pushing hard _ his four terms
in the US House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where have you been for the last eight years? Ask both
candidates that question,'' he said. Lazio's answer is that he has
been sponsoring legislation on all those issues, while Clinton has
``just been talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign strategist, Michael Murphy, considers this
distinction to be the key. ``What has Hillary Clinton ever done for
New York?'' Murphy asked a couple weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is one of several refugees from Senator John McCain's
presidential campaign who have joined Lazio, which could explain
several touches similar to McCain's campaign _ most notably the
nicknamed bus and the image of a spontaneous, populist crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to hide behind some roped line,'' Lazio roared
in Watkins Glen, where he and his wife, Patricia, walked down the
town's main street, shaking hands along the way. ``We're not going
to have scripted answers.''
</P>
<P>
   That line drew some smiles from reporters who had read the
transcript of Lazio's convention speech, which his aides had handed
out before he delivered it. There, on page 16, after a line about
how his father put the young Rick to work in his auto-supplies
store ``at pretty low wages, I remember,'' a stage-direction read,
in parentheses: ``Smile.'' (He did.)
</P>
<P>
   Another anomaly: A professional make-up artist has been
traveling on Lazio's bus this week, to cover _ as much as possible
_ his bloated lip, caused by the eight stitches he received after
he tripped and fell during a Memorial Day parade last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the crowds that turned out at the candidate's campaign
bus stops this week were not exactly spontaneous, either. Several
of the people said they had been phoned by party officials to show
up at the events.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the enthusiasm that Lazio has prompted in such a
short time is not entirely staged. Outside Binghamton, he made an
unscheduled stop at a shopping mall to buy a video for the VCR on
his bus (the movie was ``Analyze This''), and a couple dozen people
_ who would not have recognized him two weeks ago _ approached him,
smiling, to wish him well.
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken last week, a few days before the Buffalo
convention, showed the first lady and Lazio in a tie.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's strategists are aiming to beat Lazio on two fronts _
issues and stature.
</P>
<P>
   Though many Democrats are beginning to realize that Lazio is
more moderate than the ``Newt Gingrich footsoldier'' that they
attempted to paint him as at the start of his candidacy, they note
some differences that will hurt him in much of this state.
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio says he favors a woman's right to choose abortion,
he has voted to ban late-term abortions, federal funding of
abortions, and abortions in US military hospitals overseas. While
he voted for the Brady Bill and the assault-weapons ban, he opposes
the registration of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Several interest groups, on the left and the right, rate his
congressional voting record close to 50 percent, meaning he has
voted both for and against their interests in equal measure. Lazio
sees this as confirmation of his ``mainstream'' appeal, while
Clinton allies see it as a sign that he doesn't stand for anything.
Some quip his bus should be called ``The Two-Faced Express.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, playing on this sentiment and trying to knock down the
carpetbagger charge, said Thursday to a cheering crowd of
carpenters, ``My opponent tells you where he's from. I'm going to
tell you what I'm for.''
</P>
<P>
   Several delegates at the Republican convention said they were
disappointed when Giuliani first dropped out of the race. As the
nation's most prominent mayor, an outsized character with media
savvy and debating skills, he seemed a strong rival to Clinton. By
contrast, Lazio has such an eager manner and a boyish face _ he's
42 but looks 10 years younger _ some wonder if he's really
``senatorial.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, many were warming up to Lazio as possibly the
better ``giant-killer.'' First, he lacks the mayor's abrasive
personality and his roots in New York City, which many upstaters
see as hardly less foreign than Arkansas or Illinois. Second, in
the post-Cold War age, when ``Senator-Statesmen'' are nearly
extinct, it may not be a disadvantage to run as an ordinary fellow.

 &HT;    EDS: This version omits sentence in next to last graf on Ruiz
turning down a bout with Lewis.
 &HT;    Holyfield's plans put on hold
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The injured Evander Holyfield likely must wait at
least two months before facing John Ruiz, a two-month delay in his
grand plan to regather the three major heavyweight titles.
</P>
<P>
   Their June 10 date was postponed because of Holyfield's torn
muscle below the ribs on his left side, and promoter Don King said
Thursday in Las Vegas that the makeup would be rescheduled in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Caesar's Palace remains the probable site, King added. The
Showtime cable network will carry the bout for the vacant WBA
crown.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christopher Vaughns, Holyfield's physician in Atlanta, and
Dr. Flip Homansky, ringside physician for the Nevada State Athletic
Commission, estimated that Holyfield would require about four weeks
to heal. He would then need a few more weeks to train, though he
can continue aerobic work.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said he was hurt in a sparring session on May 21 on a
blow to the small of his back on the right side. The left side
began to tense up later.
</P>
<P>
   He visited a doctor in Houston, where he trains, three times
within five days, then phoned his attorney in Atlanta, Jim Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time he sparred, it got a little worse,'' Thomas said. He
returned to Atlanta on Wednesday for an MRI, which revealed the
torn muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a serious injury,'' Homansky said, ``but
it's incapacitating when he throws a punch. He can take a punch.''
</P>
<P>
   As Holyfield put it, ``It only hurts if I hit the opponent. I
hurt myself to hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas insisted the injury is unrelated to Holyfield's advanced
boxing age (37) and lengthy fight resume (41, including four losses
and a draw).
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Thomas said. ``It's a simple athletic
injury. It has nothing to do with age or deterioration. This could
happen to an 18-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has never before pulled out of a fight, though Thomas
says he twice regrets not doing so.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the ring with Michael Moorer in 1994 with a sore
shoulder. ``And it cost him,'' Thomas said, recalling the loss by
decision. ``The shoulder pretty much tore out in the second
round.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, in a rubber match with Riddick Bowe, Holyfield
took ill leading up to fight night and absorbed a technical
knockout in the eighth round.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield also mentioned that he was sick last year against in
his first meeting with Lennox Lewis, which was controversially
scored a draw. ``He kept those (ailments) to himself,'' Thomas
said. ``He wants to be 100 percent for this fight. ``
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said, ``I'm cheating myself by not going in at 100
percent. Two or three times before, I should have said I'm not
going out there. I'm a lot smarter than I was then.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Stone, Ruiz's trainer/manager, described his fighter as
devastated by the development. And he noted that Ruiz has recovered
from hand surgery a month ago, caused by a broken cereal bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ready to go,'' Stone said.

THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH ONLINE AUCTIONS: CIRCLES OF BIDDERS WORKING
TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., N.J., Colo.)   (ADDS 21st and 22nd grafs to 2nd graf with Walton's comment;
DELETES Walton being unavailable for comment in following graf.)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When eBay, the Internet auction company, suspended the seller
and voided the sale of a vivid abstract painting whose price shot
from 25 cents to $135,805 last month, his offense had nothing to do
with the authenticity of the painting or the story he invented to
go with the work.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the seller, Kenneth A. Walton, had entered a bid of
$4,500 on his own offering _ a practice known as shill bidding _ on
the second day of a 10-day auction, long before speculation that
the painting might be by the renowned artist Richard Diebenkorn
sent the price soaring.
</P>
<P>
   But a close analysis of that and other eBay art auctions reveals
that the flourishing cyberauction world faces a deeper, more
intransigent problem than lone self-bidders: the prospect of rings
of shill bidders, acting as partners. Walton, a Sacramento lawyer
who used at least five Internet names selling and buying on eBay,
appears to be just one of a circle of people who have engaged in
cross-bidding activities that may have influenced the outcome of
eBay auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the list of people who bid in the $135,805
auction, and with the help of upset eBay users, The New York Times
researched eBay's auction records and assembled a list of 33
Internet names that repeatedly bid on one another's offerings. The
participants also encouraged other bidders by posting glowing
testimonials to one another on eBay's vaunted feedback system, the
comment forum where people write about their experiences dealing
with other individuals on the site.
</P>
<P>
   This week, after using proprietary software called ``shill
hunter'' to review the list, eBay said it planned to warn two of
the names and noted that 13 of them _ including Walton's _ had been
suspended after the company's own investigations. EBay declined to
disclose why, citing privacy concerns. But that makes 15 user names
that have been disciplined in the wake of the canceled auction.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many rings are operating in the online auction
world _ or, for that matter, in the traditional auction world,
where the practice is generally considered illegal under business
codes and many state laws.
</P>
<P>
   But eBay critics contend that the company's screen is not fine
enough to detect all ring-bidding. The company acknowledged that it
reviewed bids made only in the last 30 days, which may not be long
enough to discern shillers who spread out their false bids. It also
conceded that those in the circle may have changed their bidding
patterns in recent weeks, lying low to avoid attracting attention
once Walton's auction began to make headlines on May 9.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, experts in the art world, academia and law enforcement
say, the fact that the circle surrounding Walton would not have
come to light without the media glare illustrates just how easy it
is for people acting in concert to fly beneath the devices eBay
uses to root out rigged bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for rings,'' said Robert Chesnut, eBay's associate
general counsel. ``We have detected rings. But there is a limit to
shill hunter. And there are things that look like shill bidding
that are not.'' EBay would not divulge how many people it has
expelled for shill bidding.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Every day the opportunity for shilling
grows. This year, sales in consumer-based online auctions in the
United States are expected to more than double, to $6.4 billion, up
from $3 billion in 1999, according to Jupiter Communications, a
research company. EBay's share of the market _ more than 90
percent, Jupiter says _ dwarfs that of Yahoo, Amazon and other
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   At last count eBay had 12.6 million registered users. On any
given day they place 1,000 bids a minute on the more than 4.5
million items up for sale. EBay, whose revenue is expected to
double this year, to $400 million, views the transactions on its
site as private: it does not vet the offerings or descriptions,
though it does try to remove outright frauds.
</P>
<P>
   Though eBay explicitly forbids shill bidding, company officials
say they recognize that there will always a few bad apples in a
community as large as the city of New York.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing in eBay's rules prevents a person from using more
than one Internet name. Nothing prevents friends from bidding on
one another's offerings, running up the price, so long as the bid
is sincere. Nothing prevents friends from posting nice comments
about one another. It was only on March 1 that eBay began requiring
those feedback comments to be related to actual transactions.
</P>
<P>
   While online auctions are thus ripe for manipulation, tracing
possible bidding collusion is extremely difficult. It involves
sifting through and cross-referencing dozens of bidding histories
and user feedback records, hours of work.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Joe Public,'' said Delores Gardner, a lawyer who
specializes in Internet fraud at the Federal Trade Commission.
``I'm not convinced that many people are sophisticated enough to
detect shill bidding. It takes a lot of work, and it's not the type
of work that a buyer should have to do.'' Most complaints to the
commission have been about shoddy merchandise or failure to deliver
the goods, not about bidding shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   EBay, citing cost considerations and storage capacity, removes
auction records from its site after 30 days, which makes detection
harder. And even while a bidding history is available, the bid list
discloses only the highest offer entered by each Internet name,
which sometimes masks the progress of bids. Walton's painting, for
example, drew 95 bids, but the bid history contains just 17 names,
and prices on it leap from $7,701, entered by
``animationconnection'' on May 4, to $135,505, entered by
``howdyhi'' on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happened in between is now a mystery, one that
provokes other questions about the bidding of people using Internet
names that include ``birdaroo,'' ``artpro,'' ``w.'' and Walton's
own ``golfpoorly,'' ``advice,'' ``grecescu'' and ``cheesesix.'' (He
has not disclosed his additional names.) Along with several others,
these names have regularly bid on one another's items but have
rarely placed the winning bid, and they have patted each other on
the back in feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 17 bidders on Walton's $135,805 painting, at least six _
in addition to Walton himself _ had bid on but not purchased the 36
other offerings he had placed for sale on eBay in the 30 days
before his now canceled sale.
</P>
<P>
   At least three of those six had already paid tribute to Walton
on his feedback page. And that tally does not include Walton, who
after buying a $2 CD from himself under a different Internet name
commented that he was charged less than expected for shipping and
called himself ``a really cool guy.''
</P>
<P>
   During 1999 and early this year, Walton wrote equally flattering
testimonials for five of the 17 bidders (four others plus himself).
And seven of the 17 bidders have received positive feedback from
several buyers and sellers who have links with Walton and with one
another in other recent eBay auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Some overlap is coincidental. It is in fact inevitable, because
buyers and sellers who are interested in one kind of item, like
paintings, will gravitate to those offerings, which are made again
and again by the same sellers. Some buyers prefer to do repeat
business with sellers simply because they know that those sellers
deliver.
</P>
<P>
   But if the extent of the overlap seems remarkable in this and
similar cases, eBay disagrees. ``Sometimes bidding just looks
suspicious,'' Chesnut said, ``especially in areas of collecting
that are narrow, where of course you'll be bidding in the same
area.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He recounted the tale of a judge the company bounced for
shilling who was indignant about the false accusation. ``I could
give you a half dozen other examples where we accused people of
shill bidding falsely, and they were outraged,'' he said. ``The
evidence was circumstantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the eyes of some bidders, online auctions, under the
current rules, are hoaxes waiting to happen. Walton's offering
simply brought to a head complaints many say they have already made
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay has created a monster that has grown beyond its capacity
to monitor and to police the misdeeds of some very simple kinds of
fraud out there,'' said Louis Richman, the financial editor of
Consumer Reports. Richman, who believes that shill bidding and
misrepresentation occur frequently online, said that his magazine
had no statistics about them but was designing a research project
to study online auctions systematically.
</P>
<P>
   When the stakes are small _ the average eBay sale is about $40 _
the harm may be minimal, certainly too small for prosecutors to
bother with. But a man who bid more than $126,000 on Walton's
abstract painting, and who said that after spending a week
researching Diebenkorn he had asked friends and relatives to chip
in another $125,000 if he needed it to win, feels lucky to have
escaped without mortgaging his life. (The painting's authenticity
remains unclear.)
</P>
<P>
   The man, a resident of the San Francisco Bay area who insisted
on anonymity because he feared retaliation from eBay devotees,
withdrew his bid after Walton refused to let him see the painting
in person.
</P>
<P>
   This bidder placed an offer of $126,200 at 2:30 a.m. on May 7,
about 42 hours before the bidding was to close. Then he went to
bed. ``By the time I got up, I had already been outbid,'' he said.
He bid a little more, but when ``howdyhi'' suddenly ``came out of
nowhere'' and upped the ante to $135,505 he decided he had to see
the painting before going higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howdyhi,'' whose real name is Mark Therrell and who lives in
Placerville, Calif., about 50 miles from Walton's home in
Sacramento, did not respond to an e-mail message and could not be
reached by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Among the early bidders in this auction were several whose names
regularly turn up, often in succession or nearly so, on other
offerings by a small circle of sellers.
</P>
<P>
   On May 2 Walton, using the name ``advice,'' put what he called
an ``outstanding estate oil _ Arabs on Horseback'' up for sale.
Among the bidders, 17 in all, were ``odona,'' ``astheworldturns,''
``artpro,'' ``1ackley'' and ``jgle,'' the last four in succession,
according to the posted bid history. Walton, using the name
``grecescu,'' also bid on the item, but that bid was canceled by
eBay on May 10, when the company suspended Walton for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   In April, 10 of 17 bidders _ including ``jgle,''
``astheworldturns,'' ``artpro,'' ``birdaroo,'' ``estate-queen'' and
``flipbackwards'' _ that seem to be in the circle bid on an exotic
genre painting put up for sale by ``w.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in April, ``astheworldturns,'' ``jgle,'' ``1ackley,''
``big-fat-mamba-jambas'' and ``cheesesix'' _ one of Walton's names
_ made offers in near succession on an ``abstract oil painting by
Hager'' put on the block by ``boyscoutsofamerica.'' They comprised
five of the 14 bidders for the painting.
</P>
<P>
   And in April, Therrell's sister, Alice Therrell, who also lives
in Placerville and uses the name ``pogdog(at)jps.net'' on eBay, put
up for sale a ``large oil painting by Califano _ his best!'' Among
the 16 bidders were ``astheworldturns,'' ``education1,''
``birdaroo,'' ``artpro'' and Walton, using the name ``grecescu.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those names, eBay has suspended ``education1,'' ``w.,''
``flipbackwards'' and Walton's names. It plans to warn
``boyscoutsofamerica'' as well as another name submitted to eBay by
The Times, ``docharpo.'' The others remain registered users in good
standing.
</P>
<P>
   Not every painting sold by ``advice,'' ``boyscoutsofamerica'' or
others who appear to be in the circle has attracted such
cross-bidding. But many do.
</P>
<P>
   Walton said that he was ``absolutely not'' part of a ring.
``There is nothing going on,'' he said. ``EBay got me, and I'm off,
and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past he has said that all of his questioned bids were
made on behalf of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Sbar, a New Jersey doctor who uses the name ``docharpo,''
denied being part of any bidding ring. E-mail messages or phone
calls to the other Internet names were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Greenleaf, an associate professor of marketing at the Stern
School of Business at New York University who has researched the
traditional auction process, said that there were two good clues to
indicate that someone is shill bidding for a friend: ``if the only
time he bids is when some one person is selling and if the
underbidders are very geographically close.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the information eBay users provide for other eBay
users, many in this circle of repeated interacters live in northern
California or Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Without help from eBay, it is difficult to determine how
frequently members of this circle bid or buy. But some clues are
available through eBay's feedback system, as evident from a
feedback posting on eBay about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Within four days, 10 of the names that regularly appear in
relation to Walton placed complimentary comments on the feedback
site for a seller named ``pigroast.'' ``Eh ... eh ... You sure do
know how to `cook' up one good game deal, pigroast,'' wrote
``1ackley'' on May 27, 1999. A day later, ``big-fat-mamba-jambas''
added: ``Hallelujah, Pigroast! May the Lord Come Down And Bless
Your Kind Soul!! Amen.'' Other compliments are either equally
obscure or underscore ``pigroast's'' dependability, as in
``thriftstorebob's'' comment: ``bargain city ... deal of a lifetime
... an asset to the Ebay community!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the appearance of those comments, ``pigroast''
had posted return compliments for each Internet name.
</P>
<P>
   Three of ``pigroast's'' 10 admirers _ including Walton, using
the name ``grecescu'' _ bid in the $135,805 auction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet eight of the 10 names in the ``pigroast'' feedback have two
or fewer feedback comments from other eBay users _ and they include
comments from ``pigroast'' himself. The scant number usually
indicates that these bidders rarely complete transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Of these names, eBay has suspended ``pigroast'' and
``thriftstorebob,'' while the rest remain members in good standing.
</P>
<P>
   In another uncanny episode, Therrell, who as ``pogdog'' is an
active art seller on eBay, offered a painting about six months ago
that stirred notice.
</P>
<P>
   According to a few eBay users, including David J. Carlson, a
Carmel, Calif., art dealer who employs three ``e-pickers'' to
search for authentic paintings on eBay that he might buy for
resale, ``pogdog'' put up for sale an abstract painting that also
resembled a Diebenkorn. The description never used Diebenkorn's
name and made no claim about the artist. Like Walton's, Therrell's
offering included a close-up of the work with the signature
``R.D.'' easily discernable. Therrell did not return a phone call
seeking comment or respond to an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Auction records for that offering on eBay are no longer
accessible, and the company declined to provide a bidding history
or any information about the offering, citing policy and an
inability to track the offer now. But Carlson recalls that the work
fetched more than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pogdog's'' feedback record includes many highly complimentary
comments from some of the same people. ``Artpro,'' for example,
posted two, including ``THE MOST HONEST SELLER, WITH THE BEST ITEMS
AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ON EBAY-BY FAR!,'' while ``1ackley'' wrote,
``PAINTING WAY BETTER THAN DESCRIBED! THE MOST HONEST SELLER ON
EBAY!''
</P>
<P>
   Greenleaf, the N.Y.U. professor, said he believed that Internet
companies like eBay could detect rings of friends who bid on one
another's online offerings if they wanted to. ``There should be
patterns that would be very suspicious,'' he said. ``These
companies have powerful computing ability, and it would be easy to
search for coincidences. But it's time-consuming, and eBay is very
laissez-faire.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So far, eBay has responded to reports of shill bidding mainly by
suspending a user for 30 days on the first violation and
indefinitely on the second. The company, however, said that to date
most incidents of malfeasance involve credit card fraud and the
failure to deliver goods.
</P>
<P>
   But as online auction fever grows, bidding fraud could get
worse. ``The Internet offers more opportunities to shill than
traditional auctions because you have a lot of time to think about
it,'' Greenleaf said. Furthermore, he said, the cost to a shill
bidder who gets stuck with his own property is lower, because
commission rates are just 1 to 5 percent online compared with as
much as 30 percent at Christie's and Sotheby's and at least 10
percent on Sotheby's online sites.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Bamberger, an antiquarian book dealer in San Francisco who
applauds eBay for broadening the art and antiques market, also said
companies like eBay could do more to reduce fraud. ``One of the
things I've lobbied for is to get the records left up on the site
longer,'' he said. ``They could play it into great P.R., and they
hardly have to do anything.''

HOLLYWOOD TALES JUST FICTION, GERMAN PAPER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT _ Ivana Trump confided to him her anxiety about
pimples and skin rashes. Courtney Love told him how she used her
breasts as a political statement. Sharon Stone told him how she
loved to torment men.
</P>
<P>
   Those were just a handful of the intimate celebrity interviews
that made Tom Kummer one of the hottest young journalists in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for a number of German magazines from Los Angeles, the
brash 37-year-old writer from Switzerland mesmerized editors here
with what seemed to be an unparalleled entree to America's biggest
stars.
</P>
<P>
   While most other foreign journalists in Hollywood grumbled about
being last in line for even rigidly controlled 15-minute
interviews, Kummer claimed to have befriended many stars and even
to have worked out with them in the same gyms.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem: many of his interviews never took
place. Most, published in the magazine of the Munich newspaper
Sueddeutsche Zeitung, were cobbled together from material published
elsewhere. Some appear to have been entirely fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing report on Saturday, accompanied by an apology to
readers, the newspaper concluded that many of Kummer's interviews
in its magazine ``had obviously not taken place'' and had been
``falsified.'' On Tuesday, it fired the magazine's two top editors,
Christian Kammerling and Ulf Poschardt.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than just an embarrassment. Sueddeutsche Zeitung is
one of Germany's most respected newspapers and has won widespread
praise for aggressive investigative reporting of the political
finance scandals surrounding former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   The incident also sheds light on the strange grip of American
popular culture. Thanks to satellite broadcasting, the Internet and
ever better techniques for dubbing in local languages, Hollywood
has never seemed as close to home. But the practical reality is
that foreign journalists in Hollywood get very short shrift from
the industry's public relations machine. Access to movie stars is
dished out to those journalists most likely to increase sales, and
those are mostly the big American news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bosses got mad at me, asking me why I couldn't get the kind
of interviews that Kummer was getting,'' recalled Claus Lutterbeck,
who worked in Hollywood for Stern magazine. Stern was so taken by
Kummer that it briefly hired him in 1995 and transferred Lutterbeck
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In its own report, Sueddeutsche Zeitung said the editors of its
magazine ignored widespread suspicions about Kummer, as well his
firing from another magazine in 1990 for fabricating an article.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, the magazine cut its ties to Kummer after editors
became convinced that he was fabricating material once again. But
they never told readers until a competitor, the magazine Focus,
published allegations about him two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kummer, unrepentant, has admitted using material from different
sources to create what looked like one-on-one interviews. He also
argues that magazine editors knew and approved of his methods.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with the German magazine Spiegel, he
belittled questions about the authenticity as ``too one-dimensional
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Praised by editors for his wit and efficiency, Kummer sold
articles to the newsmagazine Stern, the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung and the magazine supplement to Zurich's Tagesanzeiger.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, he published ``exclusive'' interviews
with singers, actors and celebrities like Whitney Houston, Brad
Pitt, Sharon Stone, Kim Basinger, and Ivana Trump, the former wife
of the New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump. Publicity agents
for Stone, Basinger and Courtney Love have all denied that any
interviews took place, Focus magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
   Sueddeutsche's magazine published the interview with Courtney
Love in late 1996. In it, Love supposedly told Kummer: ``I play
with my breasts, not to show off but to demonstrate a kind of
revulsion. I simply transform myself into a voice for all the
tormented souls of this world.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Kummer had expressed this
thought himself in an article nearly two years earlier in the Swiss
newspaper Weltwoche. In that article, Kummer wrote: ``She plays
with her breasts not to show off but to demonstrate revulsion. She
wants to embody the voice of all tormented souls in the world.''
Perhaps the most bizarre case was Kummer's cover story on Ivana
Trump, a long one-on-one interview that appeared in April 1999. Not
only did the interview never take place, Kummer apparently cribbed
thoughts from ``The Philosophy of Andy Warhol'' and inserted them
into the mouth of Trump.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be no great mishap in life than skin problems,'' he
quoted her as saying.``Pimples are not really a problem. They come
and they go. Skin irritations are much worse. It can only get worse
when you're turned down by a famous skin clinic.'' Catherine
Saxton, a spokeswoman for Trump, said Trump never remembered any
interview at all with Kummer and did not even know about the cover
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have looked through our calendar and cannot find any record
of a meeting with him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after publishing its own investigation, the Sueddeutsche
Zeitung was unable to explain how an obscure freelance writer could
carry on a deception involving world celebrities for nearly five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Before being fired as co-editor of the Sueddeutsche's magazine,
Poschardt told his superiors he thought that Kummer had been
``rehabilitated'' and had learned from his past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   But Stern's publisher, Werner Funk, said he cut the ties with
Kummer after his first interview because editors were convinced he
was trying to sell them a fabricated interview with the actress
Christina Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to have anything to do with him,'' Funk said in
an interview this week. Referring to Kummer and his editors at the
Sueddeutsche magazine, Funk said ``they appeared to have a
different idea of journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lutterbeck, now Stern's Washington correspondent, said many
German editors were vulnerable to falling into the same trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that no one, not even our bosses, knows how
Hollywood really works,'' Lutterbeck said. ``They don't know how
hard it is to get any access at all. They think we spend our time
at cocktail parties with movie stars. So someone like Kummer can
come along and they have no control over him.''

<P>
   QUERETARO, Mexico _ The presidential campaign has opened a vast
demographic divide between the old and new Mexicos, a political
fault line that runs smack through the Martinez household, tucked
along a tidy suburban street in central Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Martinez is a 29-year-old accountant. His wife, Karina,
once worked at a Ford dealership, but now does aerobics at a gym
and tends their children. Mention the party that has run Mexico
since the 1920s and they respond with contemptuous talk about its
legacy of graft and fraud. Like most young urban Mexicans, they
intend to vote for Vicente Fox, the first opposition candidate with
a shot at victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country needs a change and Fox can bring it,'' Martinez
said, strapping her two toddlers into car seats for a shopping
trip.
</P>
<P>
   But their maid, Lucia Hernandez, a gray-haired woman of 53 who
commutes from her tin-roofed home outside this state capital, still
praises the governing party, known as the PRI, for building a
school in her rural village 20 years ago. Like millions of older,
semiliterate, rural voters, she plans to vote for its candidate,
Francisco Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   The Martinezes and their maid reflect the dramatic voter
polarization recorded all across Mexico in polls before the
country's presidential election on July 2. Although the leading
candidates appear virtually tied, they draw their support from
radically contrasting constituencies. The traditional Mexico of
aging peasants, hardscrabble farms and corn subsidies supports
Labastida. The new Mexico, where millions of young college
graduates are modernizing an economy already bubbling with scores
of new dot-com startups, backs Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite a political cleavage,'' said Alejandro Moreno,
the chief pollster at the Mexico City newspaper Reforma. ``In no
previous election have we seen such sharp differences between
voters supporting the PRI and younger voters looking for change.''
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide survey conducted for the Reuters news agency by
Zogby International in early May found the same split that Moreno
has measured in several Reforma soundings.
</P>
<P>
   Older, semiliterate voters in farm areas were supporting
Labastida. ``But less than a third of Mexicans under 29 years old
said the PRI deserves to be elected again,'' said Andrew Hurst,
Reuters' Mexico bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   The country's divided electorate has grown by 12 million voters
since 1994, when Ernesto Zedillo won election comfortably as the
country's 13th consecutive PRI president. The trends make it all
but certain the party will eventually lose the presidency, since
the rural vote that for decades has provided its bedrock support is
disappearing as farmlands give way to industrial parks all across
this nation of 100 million people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, 30 percent of Mexico's election precincts were
classified as rural. Today, only 20 percent of the precincts, home
to 12 million of Mexico's 59 million registered voters, are rural.
Ten percent of the voters live in ``mixed'' precincts, part rural,
part urban, said Eduardo Badillo, the federal official who directed
the three-year effort to compile the voter list for this year's
balloting. In contrast, Mexico's youth vote has become dominant,
with half the electorate under 35 years old, he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Karina de Martinez, 26, is one of an estimated six million young
Mexicans expected to vote this year for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw any reason to vote before, because I knew the PRI
would win and it'd just be more of the same,'' she said. Her
husband, who manages a federal toll highway running through
Queretaro, says he does not like Fox's brash style, but will vote
for him anyway to bring change. ``Being in the government, you see
all the corruption that exists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One day in early May, Lucia Hernandez, the maid, paused as she
loaded clothes into the washing machine to ask Martinez whom she
planned to vote for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said Fox,'' Martinez said. ``Lucia said she was going to
vote for Labastida. And to tell you the truth, it made me angry!
This is why the PRI could still win, because of people like our
maid. I asked myself, `How can that be?'''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who has 14 children, lives in Chichimiquillas, a
gritty village where the business district consists of a tiny store
stocked with crackers and Coca-Cola, a tire repair shop and a
sherbet stand. To arrive at the Martinez home, she rides a bus for
an hour through bone-dry hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody votes for the PRI there,'' she said in a
conversation with a visitor in the Martinez living room, even
though many of her neighbors lost their life savings in Mexico's
1994 peso devaluation. Hundreds of straw-hatted villagers flocked
to a recent rally in the Chichimiquillas square, she said, at which
PRI officials alternately praised Labastida as a patriot and
raffled off refrigerators and washing machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't win anything,'' she said wistfully of the rally.
``Still, we have a lot of confidence in the PRI. Whenever I've
needed a hand they've always helped me. Why not say so?''
</P>
<P>
   A searing incident a decade ago appears to have sealed her PRI
loyalties forever. Hernandez took a neighbor's young daughter,
suffering from dysentery, on a bus to a county hospital, she said.
The child died in the hospital, and her parents did not have enough
money to pay for a coffin and retrieve her body. Hat in hand,
Hernandez went to the local PRI political boss to ask for help. He
gave her $50 to pay for a funeral, she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody helps me like that, I don't forget it,''
Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the PRI often seems forgotten in this state
capital, even though until just three years ago the state had never
had an opposition governor. Today both the state governor and the
mayor of the state capital are from Fox's center-right National
Action Party. The city's prosperous economy is based on dozens of
factories that turn out everything from tractors to cornflakes. As
in many Mexican cities, National Action has grown so rapidly in
Queretaro that Labastida advisers say his campaign has virtually
written it off as a lost cause.
</P>
<P>
   One young voter who helped vote National Action into power in
Queretaro is Rodrigo Marvan Cuevas, 26, who is just embarking on an
architectural career. His father, a well-known architect, has built
office buildings for PRI governments for several decades, but
Rodrigo considers the party's long monopoly on politics an
embarrassing anachronism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our political system is still in diapers!'' he mused during a
conversation at his studio in a leafy Queretaro neighborhood. ``How
can it be that only recently the vote in Mexico has begun to
count?'' Marvan intends to vote for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``No private business ever does well without competition, and
it's the same thing in politics,'' he said, adjusting the volume on
a recording by Duke Ellington as he talked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a single PRI friend,'' he said. ``In my
generation and at my educational and professional level, there just
are no PRI members.''

 &HT;    Gore pledges fight to the finish
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vice President Al Gore vowed in Atlanta on Thursday to
lead the war on cancer, doubling federal funding for research
within the next five years. He also pledged to increase fivefold
the number of clinical trials for new treatments and set a goal of
eliminating deaths from colon, breast and prostate cancer within
the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pledge this from my heart: If I am entrusted with the
presidency, I will work with you to put the same energy and
priority into fighting cancer that we would put into preventing a
war that could take 500,000 American lives every year,'' said Gore,
who brought his presidential campaign to Emory University's health
sciences campus and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston.
</P>
<P>
   Likening the effort to John F. Kennedy's mission to put an
American on the moon, Gore said wiping out cancer is a
``reasonable'' and ``attainable'' goal, similar to eradicating
smallpox from the world and polio from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He said the timing was right for such a venture since America
recently has seen historic drops in the incidence of cancer and in
death rates, as well as the creation of new therapies to fight the
disease. Gore's cancer-fighting initiatives would build upon
efforts by President Clinton, who has pushed since 1998 for an
increase in spending on cancer research _ with a goal of a 65
percent increase within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore outlined a plan to combat cancer that would include:
</P>
<P>
   Revising Medicare so that elderly people can get cancer
screenings, such as mammograms and colorectal screenings, without
having to pay deductibles or co-payments.
</P>
<P>
   Urging employers to let workers get cancer screenings on paid
time, similar to a program started by Boston's city government.
</P>
<P>
   Developing uniform ``best practice standards'' for physicians.
Such standards would help more patients benefit from advancements
in detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Now, Gore said,
standards of care vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would mandate that private insurers routinely cover
the medical bills of patients enrolled in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants to strengthen the fight against children's smoking,
through beefed-up advertising campaigns and tougher penalties
against companies that pander to kids.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan was a hit with the friendly crowd, who rewarded him
with two standing ovations and cheers at several points. The plan
also drew support from former President Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father, mother and all my siblings were addicted to
cigarettes, and all died with cancer,'' Carter said in a
</P>
<P>
   statement issued Thursday. ``This is why I applaud the
development of an aggressive and comprehensive cancer-fighting
agenda, as Al Gore has proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore specified funding for three areas: $300 million toward the
creation of a university-based ``Centers for Excellence'' that
would work with the National Institutes of Health on cancer
research, $200 million for anti-smoking advertising and $25 million
for school-based nutrition programs.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society declined comment on the vice
president's proposals. The nonprofit organization has been working
with all candidates to develop such goals, said spokesman Roger
Salazar. Other groups, such as the National Breast Cancer
Coalition, reported they had not studied the plan in enough detail
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johns, Emory Healthcare's chief executive officer, said
he believed Gore's plan ``was on target'' _ focusing on prevention
and patients' access to care. ``I think it's a wonderful thing for
someone to set bars and challenges,'' he said.

 &HT;    A big red reunion
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Immediately after the 1976 Cincinnati Reds, a.k.a.,
The Big Red Machine, completed a four-game sweep of the New York
Yankees, club president/general manager Bob Howsam, the
construction engineer of The BRM, accepted the trophy and uttered
some prophetic words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball fans everywhere better enjoy what they have just
seen, because it will never happen again,'' he said. ``Never again
will a baseball team without use of free agents dominate the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Free agency changed the way teams built winners.
The legacy of Howsam and The BRM was that the team was a dominant
winner from 1970 to 1976, then faded into near-oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Red Machine re-surfaces Saturday at Cinergy Field as
part of a 1975 team reunion celebration, some with expanded
waist-lines, some with graying hair, but still young in spirit and
each stuffed with memories from better times.
</P>
<P>
   The Machine was built from within, either with players nurtured
and cultivated in the Reds system or through trades by using
players from the system.
</P>
<P>
   Nine home-grown players were featured: catcher Johnny Bench,
first baseman Tony Perez, shortstop Davey Concepcion, third baseman
Pete Rose, right fielder Ken Griffey Sr., starting pitchers Don
Gullett and Gary Nolan, relief pitchers Will McEnaney and Rawlins
Jackson Eastwick III.
</P>
<P>
   Five players were acquired through two trades: second baseman
Joe Morgan, left fielder George Foster, center fielder Cesar
Geronimo and starting pitchers Jack Billingham and Freddie Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Not one player was brought in through free agency because Howsam
refused to cave in to the hire-for-pay mercenary system that was
engulfing the game. The first Cincinnati free-agent signing was
outfielder Paul Blair in 1979, after Howsam was out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The team's manager, George ``Sparky'' Anderson, has been elected
to the baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Bench, Morgan and Perez are in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Rose would have been were it not for his gambling tendencies.
And Rose isn't part of Saturday night's re-union, banished from the
game and from being with his former teammates by commissioner Bud
Selig.
</P>
<P>
   Concepcion's numbers are better than five of the 10 shortstops
in Cooperstown, including Phil Rizzuto and PeeWee Reese.
</P>
<P>
   Gullett was on his way to Hall of Fame numbers when a shoulder
injury ended his career at age 27, after he had posted a 109-50
major-league record with 44 complete games and a 3.63 career earned
run average.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey finished with a .296 career average and is overlooked
because he wasn't a power hitter, accumulating only 152 home runs
in his 18-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Geronimo was one of the finest defensive players ever to roam
center field.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Foster hit 52 home runs, drove in 149 and had 388 total
bases, all still club records.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Red Machine players left some on-the-field legacies,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Bench invented the hinged catcher's mitt, enabling him to be the
first catcher to snag balls with one hand, like a first baseman,
and he was the first to wear a batting helmet when he caught.
</P>
<P>
   Concepcion discovered that throwing the ball to first base on
one hop on AstroTurf got the ball to first base quicker, a method
used by many shortstops to this day, including his successor in
Cincinnati, Barry Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   After winning seven straight post-season games in 1976, sweeping
three in the National League playoffs from the Philadelphia
Phillies when a best-of-five format was used, the Reds swept four
from the Yankees. Teams in the second half of the 20th century,
from 1950 on, were measured by the standards set by the Big Red
Machine and the BRM was compared favorably to the 1927 New York
Yankees, generally accepted as the best team of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching staff was not solid through and through and more
often than not, except when Gullett pitched, the Reds clubbed
opponents into submission, prompting Billingham to come up with
some very bad verse any time he pitched.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of how many runs he needed to win, Billingham said,
``Seven is heaven, eight we skate, nine is divine and 10 we'll
surely win.'' OK, so Henry Wadsworth Longfellow he wasn't, but he
was right.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's legacy was a hands-off, let-em-play policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a guy who barely had a cup of coffee in the major
leagues, a guy who couldn't hit,'' Anderson said. ``What was I
going to tell Johnny Bench and Tony Perez and Joe Morgan and Pete
Rose. I'll never forget right after I took over the team, Bench
tapped me on the shoulder in the dugout one day, when I was
standing in front of him, and said, 'Sparky, let me give you some
advice. Just stay out of our way and we'll carry you to the top.'''
And he was right.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Deception is reality.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That, perhaps more than anything else, sums up the life and
times of Indiana Pacers guard Chris Mullin.
</P>
<P>
   That phrase describes not only Mullin's textbook-pure game but
his appearance as well, where he seems to have gone out of his way
to cultivate the central-casting version of the perfect Hoosier
native.
</P>
<P>
   With his crew-cut blond hair (so short his scalp shines on the
sides), his pale blue eyes and paler white skin, Mullin is such a
ringer for one of those Hoosier high school phenoms of the past
that you half-expect him to have one of those hyphenated names like
Jimmy-Dan or Bobby-Dean.
</P>
<P>
   That's the deception.
</P>
<P>
   Reality hits you the moment Mullin opens his mouth and the
Brooklynese starts spilling out. While not quite as over the top as
the ``yooze guyz'' of Goodfellas or The Sopranos, Mullin quite
obviously is New York City-born and -bred.
</P>
<P>
   And he's now back in the city _ his city _ as the Pacers prepare
for tonight's Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals. But Mullin
has yet to play a single second against the Knicks, which has to
cut him deeply, especially with his family and friends sitting in
the stands and watching on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Even Indiana coach Larry Bird gives Mullin a wide berth,
especially when the Pacers are in the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say much to Chris, because I know he's dying inside,''
Bird said. ``I don't like to see Chris sitting over there not
playing. It's killing him. It's got to be killing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird insists defensive matchups, putting the 36-year-old Mullin
up against the likes of Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston, are why
Mullin isn't playing.
</P>
<P>
   But like his jumper, Mullin's attitude is pure textbook (just
look under the chapter, ``Boat; Not Rocking'').
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while his voice may fill the room, his ego does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, (not playing against New York) doesn't bother me at all,''
said Mullin, perhaps pulling another deceptive maneuver. ``It seems
to tweak a lot of people besides me. I get asked a lot about it,
but it really doesn't bother me. I didn't play a lot this season,
so it's not like I was playing 30 minutes (a game) all season and
then when the playoffs came I stopped playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come playoff time, it's all about matchups. I think the one
thing is that I can be consistent with the things I can control. So
20 hours of the day are mine _ I can work out, feel good and have
good energy. Or I could be obsessing about the two hours that I
think they should have done for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The odd thing is that Mullin actually brought this upon himself.
</P>
<P>
   With the Pacers looking to revamp the lineup, Mullin approached
Bird about surrendering his starting role so sixth man Jalen Rose
could get more minutes and more looks in the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Things worked out well for Rose, who was named the NBA's Most
Improved Player. But Mullin saw his average of 23 minutes a game
last season plunge to just over 12 this year _ and that doesn't
count the 24 games Mullin sat out because Bird didn't play him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went to the coaches to kind of step down as a starter,
I don't think he envisioned this,'' said teammate Austin Croshere,
who considers Mullin a mentor. ``I haven't spoken to him about (not
playing vs. the Knicks), but I can only imagine that it's very
difficult for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never said anything, and he's never complained about it,
but that's a tribute to the type of person he is. He wants to do
anything for the team, so he's not going to rock the boat. Anybody
on this team knows that if you put him in a 3-point contest you're
going to lose. Even if you want to play one-on-one or two-on-two
with him. There's a lot of game left in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate and fellow New York native Mark Jackson, who also
played with Mullin at St. John's, couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a scientist to the game of basketball,'' Jackson said.
``He hasn't changed a bit since the first time I met him in New
York. He's usually the first one in the gym and the last one out.
He's a worker and a great friend, an example of what type of role
model an NBA player should be.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't too long ago, though, that Mullin was one of the top
stars in the league, on a par _ scoring-wise, anyway _ with the
likes of Michael Jordan, Dominique Wilkins, Karl Malone, Alex
English and Clyde Drexler.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mullin's penchant for deception _ the on-court kind _
that made him so effective. While he lacked quickness, Mullin
developed a quick first step and an even quicker release on his
lefty jumper. Between the 1988-89 and 1992-93 seasons, Mullin
averaged 27.8 points, scoring almost 10,000 points in that span.
</P>
<P>
   And while most basketball fans can easily tick off most of the
names from the original Dream Team _ Magic Johnson, Jordan, Patrick
Ewing, David Robinson, John Stockton, Malone and Bird (some can
even get Christian Laettner, the token college player) _ many seem
to forget about Mullin.
</P>
<P>
   But his Dream Team gold medal from the 1992 Olympics sits right
next to the one he won at the 1984 Olympics, another reminder of
the Chris Mullin that once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't forget about it,'' said Bird of Mullin's place in NBA
history. ``I know what he means to the game. It's just that right
now in this series it's not a good matchup. So far, anyway. But
Chris usually plays well against the Knicks, so you never know. He
might get in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering his resume, it would be easy for Mullin to be
bitter. But he continues to watch, not letting a single complaint
pass from his lips as the Pacers attempt to land the franchise's
first berth in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enjoyable not playing, but your job becomes something
else, which is to be a professional and be ready,'' Mullin said.
``It's been an adjustment. Three or four years ago, it would have
been hard to do this. But there are a lot more important things. My
friends and family have a lot harder time with it than I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like anything is slipping away. I don't feel like
I have to prove myself. I'm every bit the player I was last year;
it's just not my time right now, but that doesn't mean somewhere
down the line it's not going to be, and I want to be ready.''

SPORTS COLUMN: GLEN SATHER HAS A ROLE THAT'S BIGGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a left wing with the New York Rangers three
decades ago, Glen Sather is mostly remembered as what is known now
as a role player. Occasionally in an unusual role. Such as the time
Emile Francis, the Rangers' coach, tapped him on the shoulder after
center Jean Ratelle had lost the edge on his skates. Sather hopped
over the boards onto the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' Francis said. ``Go in and sharpen Ratelle's
skates.''
</P>
<P>
   Or when the Rangers installed a new safe in the dressing room to
hold the players' valuables. Only the trainer knew the combination
lock. But there was Sather, stretched out on the floor, listening
to the clicks inside the safe as he turned the lock this way and
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slats opened that safe,'' Francis has often said. ``Right then
I knew he would be a general manager some day.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 56, Glen Sather has a bigger role: find the
combination of players and coaches that will open the Rangers'
safe. With a seven-year contract for at least $20 million as
president and general manager, he has been entrusted with
sharpening the franchise that for the last three seasons was not
even good enough to be among the 16 teams in the Stanley Cup
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Say this for Dave Checketts, the Garden impresario: He got the
man out there with the best resume.
</P>
<P>
   In his two decades as the Edmonton Oilers' boss, Sather put
together five Stanley Cup teams from 1984 to 1990, including the
first four as their coach as well as general manager. He is already
in the Hockey Hall of Fame, but it's not fair to expect him to be
that successful with the Rangers, at least not right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different then,'' he said of assembling the nucleus of
that Oiler team. ``We had Gretzky, and he was 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Those Oiler teams had more than Wayne Gretzky; they had Mark
Messier, Grant Fuhr, Jari Kurri, Glenn Anderson, Paul Coffey, Kevin
Lowe, Esa Tikkanen. Even after Sather traded Gretzky to Los Angeles
because the Oilers could no longer afford the salary that the Great
One deserved, the Oilers won that fifth cup in 1990 with Messier as
the man.
</P>
<P>
   Sather later traded Messier to the Rangers, who after a 54-year
drought finally won the cup in 1994 with Messier as the man.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe the Rangers' fans over Messier's ugly departure,
Checketts and Sather are expected to bring back Messier from
Vancouver if he becomes a free agent July 1. Not that Messier, at
39, would suddenly lift the Rangers to the Stanley Cup level, but
his locker-room dignity would demand what was missing in a $61.2
million payroll: accountability from the other players.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Rangers' true tradition is having won only one
Stanley Cup in the last 60 years, Checketts, a basketball guy who
didn't arrive here until a decade ago, prefers to relate to the
celebration of having finally won that cup in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted somebody who played here, who understood being
here,'' Checketts said of Sather. ``That was part of our problem.
That's why I sent Stephane Quintal home when he said he didn't want
to be here. Not enough respect to be a Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Sather understands that respect. In his transient career with
six National Hockey League teams, those Ranger teams he was on with
Rod Gilbert, Vic Hadfield, Brad Park, Ed Giacomin and Ratelle were
always in the playoffs. In 1972 they went to the cup finals, losing
to Bobby Orr's Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't want to win the cup in a flash,'' Checketts said.
``We want to build a dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   That's presumptuous. But in hockey, as in baseball, dynasties
are possible because there is no salary cap. As long as a franchise
is willing to pay top dollar to its best players, as the Yankees
have, a good team can stay together and grow together. In football
and basketball, the salary cap doesn't allow that.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers now are a disaster, not a dynasty: a disaster
that Sather surely will rebuild into at least a playoff team next
season. His first move will be to hire a coach, possibly the
current Oiler coach, Kevin Lowe, or Craig MacTavish, an Oiler
assistant. Both were on the Rangers' cup team in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Sather's job is not to win the cup so much as to lift
the Rangers toward the level of the New Jersey Devils, who took a
1-0 lead into Thursday night's second game of the Stanley Cup final
with the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of Lord Stanley's chalice at Thursday's news
conference in the Madison Square Garden rotunda, Checketts welcomed
Sather to the Big Apple with a silver apple from Tiffany's where,
Checketts joked, Sather's wife, Ann, would now be shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know me very well yet,'' Sather said with a smile.
``Ann won't be in Tiffany's.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Sather smiled too. Maybe because when she was asked later if
she would be going to Tiffany's now, she smiled and said, ``I've
been there.''

REPORT GIVES U.S. EDUCATION `A' FOR EFFORT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An annual survey issued by the federal government
Thursday paints a picture of a nation newly committing itself to
education at all levels, with more toddlers in pre-school, more
high school students going directly to college and more adults
returning to class.
</P>
<P>
   The report, a comprehensive statistical survey of the nation's
educational system, shows high school students taking more
demanding courses and achieving at their highest levels in
mathematics and science since a federal commission declared in 1983
that the quality of U.S. schools posed a national crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite worries resulting from school shootings at Columbine and
elsewhere, the report says that school violence has not increased
in the last quarter-century and that an overwhelming majority of
teachers remain very confident they can maintain discipline in the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The data, issued by the National Center for Education Statistics
at the Department of Education, did show more parents turning away
from local public schools, to private schools or school choice
programs like charter schools. And the level of parent confidence
in the schools, customarily high, has slipped slightly in the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Further, federal education officials acknowledged other reasons
for some concern. For one thing, students in the United States
still lag behind those of many industrialized countries in both
math and science. And while the officials say rigorous courses can
allow needy children to rise above failing schools, the report
shows that poor minority children remain less likely than their
white peers to take those courses or even attend schools where they
are offered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the numbers show a nation pushing hard to improve its
schools and its overall level of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the indicators suggest that we're setting higher
expectations, and students are learning up to those expectations,''
said Frank S. Holleman III, deputy education secretary. ``The
American people are very serious about education.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``The Condition of Education,'' looks at 67 vital
signs of the nation's educational health, from readiness for
kindergarten to the cost of college, from attitudes about
mathematics to a graduate degree's effect on voter participation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The nation's public schools had 43.2 million students in 1999,
the report said, with baby boomers' children causing enrollment to
bulge in elementary and middle schools. But the number of people
choosing to send their children to pre-school, or to go to college,
or to return to school for adult education, is also increasing,
producing higher numbers at all levels of schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment from one level of education to the next varies by
gender, by race and by income. For instance, fully 60 percent of
black 3-year-olds and 81 percent of black 4-year-olds attend
pre-school, compared with only 47 percent and 70 percent of their
peers among whites, and 26 percent and 64 percent of peers among
Hispanics. Poor white children are the least likely to attend
pre-school.
</P>
<P>
   Women, who a few years ago began to edge out men as a percentage
of the college population, are entering higher education at even
faster rates. The report says high school girls are more likely
than boys to say they will definitely get a bachelor's degree, and
women increased to 57 percent of the college population in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After the issuance of ``A Nation at Risk,'' the 1983 federal
report that described the nation's schools as woefully substandard,
a panel charged with proposing means for improvement recommended
that all students be required to take more, and more rigorous,
course work.
</P>
<P>
   The new numbers suggest that schools have largely followed that
advice. The average number of courses taken in high school had
increased to 25 by 1998, from 22 in 1982. The number of students
taking the highest-level math courses increased to 27 percent from
11 percent in that period, and the number taking both chemistry and
physics jumped to 19 percent from 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``States are requiring more courses, and moving away from
anything-goes, shopping-mall high school that was in vogue 30 years
ago,'' said Christopher Cross, president of the Council for Basic
Education, which assists states in setting up academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Grasmick, Maryland's superintendent of schools, said: ``We
recognized we had not challenged our students to the extent they
need to be challenged. We're encouraging a much higher level of
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says students from families that are poor or not well
educated increase their odds of finishing college by taking
rigorous high school courses _ so much so that they are then just
as likely as their better-off peers to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For low-income students in particular,'' said Holleman,
``taking the right courses is critical not only to their decision
to go to college, but to their success once they attend.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in fact, students as a whole are achieving at higher
levels. According to the report, the number of 17-year-olds who
showed advanced mathematical proficiency on the National Assessment
of Educational Progress test increased to 60 percent in 1996 from
49 percent in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   But educators and officials pointed out that U.S. students still
did not take courses as rigorous as their peers in many other
industrialized countries. According to the report, 39 percent of
mathematics courses in Japan and 28 percent in Germany received the
highest-quality rating by a panel of researchers, while none in the
United States did.

 &HT;    Immigrants campaign for change, awareness
 &HT;    By Kelly Simmons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Miriam Bley was 20 when she tried to leave Cuba for
the United States the first time in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   At the Havana airport, military security officers rifled through
her bags and patted down her clothing, she recalled Thursday. When
her mother handed her three pesos she had saved for the trip, Bley
panicked, afraid that the guards would suspect she was smuggling
money out of the country. She went into the bathroom and flushed it
down the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   When she came out, the guards were waiting for her. ``They told
me I had done something unforgivable, disrespectful,'' Bley said.
``They said I could face a trial or go to jail. Or I could not ever
be allowed to leave the country. When I heard the noise of the
airplane leaving, my heart was breaking.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a year _ and some influence from a high-level Cuban
immigration official, Bley said _ before she was allowed to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Those memories of the Communist regime in Cuba are what brought
Bley to the the Cuban Club in Doraville Thursday to decry the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that immigration officials had
acted appropriately in denying the 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez an
asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's preposterous to think that Elian would be able to live a
sane and humane life (in Cuba),'' said Rafael Andino. ``We're
extremely saddened and outraged by the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Elian's Miami residents have two weeks to appeal the
decision, the Cuban-Americans gathered Thursday sensed that the
battle was nearly over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know at this point that we can do much more than
pray,'' Frank Fernandez said.'' Pray for this boy, who will
essentially spend his life in slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Andino and Fernandez, Cuban descendants who met while classmates
at Georgia Tech, formed the group Concerned Americans of Cuban
Heritage soon after Elian was taken from the home of his Miami
relatives by federal officials. The purpose of the group was to
start a dialogue in Atlanta about human rights violations that
continue in Cuba, Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our main concern,'' said Andino, an engineer for a
pharmaceutical company who left Cuba in 1968 at the age of 3.
``It's not an issue of a father's right at all. The issue is that
under Cuban law, it's not possible for Elian's father to speak
freely for his son and it's not possible for Elian to speak freely.
That's what we want people to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the group said it planned to reach out to members of
Congress to try to change immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be in time to help Elian,'' Fernandez said. ``In the
future, other Elians might not have to face this scenario.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN PRESIDENT SAID HE PREDICTED HIS PARTY WOULD FACE TIGHT
RACE IN 2000
 &HT;    (450&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In an interview with visiting U.S. newspaper
editors Thursday, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo said he warned
his 71-year-old ruling party long ago it would face a stiff battle
to hold onto power in this year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost six years ago when I became president-elect I went to
my party and said, 'OK, we have won this election. This has been
clean, transparent and legal election,''' Zedillo told members of
the American Society of Newspaper Editors. ``But we must not be
satisfied either with the state of democracy in our country or . .
. the capacity of our party to compete in a full democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned to my people in our party that I anticipated . . .
that this race in the year 2000 would be a highly competed and
close race,'' Zedillo said. ``A little bit more than a year ago . .
. I repeated the same. I said, 'OK, we have to get ready for a
close race.'''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo met with the editors just a month before Mexico's July 2
election, which is indeed expected to be the closest presidential
race in this country's modern history.
</P>
<P>
   Top opposition candidate Vicente Fox Quesada, is neck-in-neck
with Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the candidate of Zedillo's party.
</P>
<P>
   That party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has
controlled Mexico's presidency since 1929. Fox has mounted a
vigorous campaign that calls for change, and blames the PRI for
corruption and for leaving half the country impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said electoral reforms during his administration and
before have paved the way for more political competition in Mexico,
which has suffered from a reputation for electoral fraud and
vote-buying on behalf of the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason is very simple,'' Zedillo said when asked
why he thought his party was fighting so hard in this year's
election. ``The others have learned very well to compete with the
new rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign is being financed largely by public
funds this year. The candidates have equal access to buy time for
commercials in the media.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has noted improvements in coverage by a media
once completely under the PRI's thumb. But election officials are
still criticizing coverage in some media as biased toward the PRI,
especially in Mexico's provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has also complained that some federal social
service programs might be used in rural areas to induce votes for
the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo has denied any political manipulation of programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the middle of a very intense, highly competed
election,'' he said. ``But for me, the most important aspect of
that election is that it is being conducted with the rules and
institutions that fully guarantee citizens that their votes will be
counted . . . and will be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional ad follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo also talked to the editors about the investigation into
the December 1998 killing of Philip True, a Mexico-based reporter
for the San Antonio (Texas) Express-News newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Two suspects are in jail awaiting trial in Jalisco state, where
True was killed while on a trip to write about Huichol Indians.
</P>
<P>
   American Society of Newspaper Editors president Richard Oppel _
the editor of the Austin American-Statesman _ traveled to Jalisco
with other editors to meet with the state attorney general. They
were told a trial would probably start in three to five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was very sad,'' Zedillo said of True's killing.
``But I think that his case should not be interpreted as meaning
that journalists are not safe because they are journalists in this
country. Unfortunately, we have a security problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said, ``Mr. True went into this place, these rather
primitive communities with a very particular culture,'' and may not
have been aware of the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that full justice is made in this process,'' he said.

INTERLEAGUE PLAY NEEDS TINKERING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  ``Interleague play'' is such a bloodless phrase, conveying
none of the clashing emotions the concept inspires even now, three
years after it became reality. So let's call it what it is.
</P>
<P>
   It's Jesse Ventura in spikes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bulging, bellowing bull in baseball's china shop. It's an
irritant to the purists, a salve to the populists. It's the answer
to the simplistic cry for something _ anything! _ different. It's a
development that wouldn't have been necessary in the first place if
the establishment hadn't been screwing up.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shock to the senses back then but feels strangely
natural now, leaving some of the purists to wonder what they were
so worried about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before it began, because I'm basically a traditionalist, I
wasn't sure we should change everything,'' said Dodgers CEO Bob
Daly, who was no more than a well-connected fan when games between
National and American League teams were first blended into the
baseball schedule in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Three years seem to have changed Daly's mind. Maybe the Dodgers'
25-19 record in interleague games has something to do with it.
Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do like the interleague play,'' he said this week. ``I liked
being able to watch Ken Griffey (Jr.) when he was in Seattle. It's
a chance to see those great ballplayers (in the other league).''
</P>
<P>
   But if Daly's change of heart is typical of how baseball people
have come to feel about the trashing of a near-century of
tradition, so is his belief that we haven't seen the best that
interleague play has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Daly would like to see interleague play broadened by rotating
the divisional matchups _ so the Dodgers, for example, wouldn't
face the teams from the American League West year after year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see the Yankees, Boston, Cleveland, some of the
other teams come in here,'' he said at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Daly's opinion, changing with the seasons, does indeed reflect
the ambivalence many properly feel toward interleague play in its
present format.
</P>
<P>
   As interleague play gets under way for the fourth time, with the
Dodgers and Angels meeting in Anaheim at 7 p.m. and 26 other teams
taking part today, it remains either too much of a bad thing or too
little of a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Or both. The issue, like that leather-jacketed governor, doesn't
seem to be going away.
</P>
<P>
   Interleague play was a product of the owners-players dispute
that wiped out the 1995 World Series and left baseball officials
desperate to do something (anything!) fan-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Having stolen a page from the NBA and tried to market individual
players and their personalities, baseball figured the least it
could do was give fans a chance to see all of those players. So
teams were scheduled to play 15 to 18 of their 162 regular-season
games against teams from the other league.
</P>
<P>
   The original concept would have had a star like Mark McGwire, of
the St. Louis Cardinals (of the National League's Central
Division), showing up in Seattle (of the American League West) once
every three years.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you're giving fans expansion, more playoff teams and
all the home runs they can eat, why make them wait for the World
Series to see that dream matchup of the Yankees and Braves?
</P>
<P>
   As well, baseball trumpeted interleague play for fulfilling
latent regional rivalries _ Dodgers-Angels, Cubs-White Sox,
Mets-Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Has the gimmick worked? Attendance figures say it has been, on
balance, popular. An average of 33,482 fans (up 16.8 percent from
intraleague games) can't be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Or can they? Interleague play cannot yet be called an artistic
success, or said to have made baseball better competition.
</P>
<P>
   __ The revamped schedule has added interleague games at the
expense of the extra games teams used to play against teams from
their own divisions, diluting the drama of pennant races and
subtracting showdowns between existing rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will face the San Francisco Giants only 12 times in
2000, down from 18 in 1992, before realignment and the advent of
interleague play. This promotes rivalries?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a proponent of more intradivisional play,'' said Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson. ``You can put me down as a traditionalist, a
bona fide traditionalist.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Having different teams playing different opponents can
unfairly tilt the races for wild-card playoff spots.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when the Cubs, Giants and Mets battled for the NL wild
card, Chicago had the advantage of playing its interleague games
against the AL Central (a collective 57 games below .500) while San
Francisco faced the AL West (one game under) and New York faced the
AL East (62 games over). The Cubs forced the Giants to a one-game
playoff at Wrigley Field and won it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the fact that ERA and home run titles are being
decided among guys who didn't play in the same ballparks,'' Dodgers
pitcher Orel Hershiser said, looking at the schedule imbalance as
an individual.
</P>
<P>
   __ For every Dodgers-Angels matchup that might stir some
curiosity _ Edison Field's only three 39,000-plus crowds after
April last season came for the Dodgers in July _ there are a couple
of disasters pitting losers with no historical or geographical
connection against one another.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City plays at Pittsburgh tonight. Let's not all jump on a
plane at once.
</P>
<P>
   __ Until the leagues agree on the designated hitter, AL teams
will always be fish out of water having to bench their DHs while
playing in NL parks. That helps to explain NL teams' 362-327
advantage in interleague victories.
</P>
<P>
   __ The curiosity is in danger of fading as teams play the same
teams for the fourth year in a row. Until it gives us
Dodgers-Yankees, interleague play is just calisthenics.
</P>
<P>
   The chances for improvement depend on how baseball resolves its
looming argument over league and division realignment. The owners'
meeting scheduled for June has been postponed indefinitely. If they
can't even schedule a meeting, how can they schedule interleague
play?
</P>
<P>
   The idea's initial popularity at the turnstiles gives it a
chance to work. But it will feel like a novelty until baseball
figures out how to make it fit into and not detract from the
pennant races that historically define the sport's drama.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, interleague play is the grappler in the oak-paneled
office. It hasn't ruined everything and it just might be a good
idea, but you hope it doesn't get any ideas about the crystal
vase. &QL;

KANKE KNOWS WINS WILL COME
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MK Kanke has been racing on the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest
Series off and on for the better part of the last 13 years. Seldom
has he been this close to a points title.
</P>
<P>
   Only don't ask the Kennedy High graduate to talk about series
championships. He's been close before and fallen short every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about points at the last race,'' Kanke said.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's Food 4 Less 100 at El Cajon Speedway in
eastern San Diego County, the sixth race on the 19-race schedule,
the 38-year-old Frazier Park resident is four points out of first
and going to a track that has treated him well over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my first win on the series there,'' Kanke said. ``We
should do well. I'm looking forward to a top-five finish.''
</P>
<P>
   That first win came in 1993, his sixth year on the series. In
1997, he also finished second at El Cajon, where he has seven
top-five finishes over his career.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Kanke is the among the series leaders, he has
yet to win a race this year. He has two top-fives, including a
second-place finish at Irwindale Speedway where he missed the
checkered flag by half a second behind Greg Pursley of Newhall.
</P>
<P>
   But the series veteran knows the wins will come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those deals where if you run in the top fives,
you'll win some races,'' Kanke said. ``I really thought we had a
shot at Irwindale. But it was my first time at Irwindale. I pretty
much gave (Pursley) everything I had.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Record tests for Hornaday: Ron Hornaday Jr. of Palmdale has
plenty of reasons to be excited about Saturday's NASCAR Busch Grand
National Division race at Dover Downs International Speedway in
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Hornaday enters the MBNA Platinum 200 in fourth place
in the series standings, one place higher than last week.
</P>
<P>
   For another, Hornaday has been running practice laps at the
``Monster Mile'' in 23 seconds flat, nearly .2 seconds faster than
the track record set by Winston Cup driver Matt Kenseth last year.
</P>
<P>
   After three years on the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series and this
year on the Busch circuit, Hornaday has yet to race at Dover.
Still, the few laps Hornaday has turned have been to his liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dover is just like a big Bristol to me, and I like it,''
Hornaday said. ``This is the type of track I love. It has big
banking, and a driver makes a huge difference here. It is
definitely a track that you have to respect, but you can't be
timid. If you get timid here, you either get wrecked or lapped in a
hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Chasing Voigt at Irwindale Speedway: Ben Walker of Canyon
Country took the second of two NASCAR Super Late Model Food 4 Less
Twin 50 races Saturday night at Irwindale Speedway. But a pair of
top fives from series leader Greg Voigt of Goleta secured a safe
lead in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who also finished third in the first Twin 50 feature of
the night, is 80 points behind Voigt, who finished fourth in the
first feature and was runner-up in the second.
</P>
<P>
   In other action at Irwindale Speedway, T.K. Karvasek of North
Hills won the NASCAR Super Stock main and Ross Uppman of Hawaiian
Gardens won the NASCAR Mini Stock main.
</P>
<P>
   __ Baja 500 kicks off with local flavor: A handful of local
drivers will be taking part in the 32nd running of the Tecate/SCORE
Baja 500 this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the team of John Clark Gable and Dodd Darin of
Malibu in the top-class Trophy Truck division, George Seeley of
Glendale will run in the Class 5 division, Bill Markel of Lancaster
in Class 8, Dennis Nuckles of Leona Valley and Ty Godde of
Lancaster in SCORE Lites, Kevin Ward of North Hollywood in
motorcycle Class 30 for riders over 30 years old and Richard
Jackson of Acton in motorcycle Class 50 for riders over 50 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   The desert race, round three of the SCORE Desert Series, covers
441.6 miles of desert terrain through Baja California, starting and
finishing in Ensenada.
</P>
<P>
   The race starts at 6 a.m. Saturday for motorcycles and ATVs;
7:30 a.m. for the rest of the classes. The race ends 18 hours later
Sunday night.

 &HT;    MEXICAN PRESIDENT SAID HE PREDICTED HIS PARTY WOULD FACE TIGHT
RACE IN 2000
 &HT;    (450&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In an interview with visiting U.S. newspaper
editors Thursday, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo said he warned
his 71-year-old ruling party long ago it would face a stiff battle
to hold onto power in this year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost six years ago when I became president-elect I went to
my party and said, 'OK, we have won this election. This has been a
clean, transparent and legal election,''' Zedillo told members of
the American Society of Newspaper Editors. ``But we must not be
satisfied either with the state of democracy in our country or . .
. the capacity of our party to compete in a full democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned to my people in our party that I anticipated . . .
that this race in the year 2000 would be a highly competed and
close race,'' Zedillo said. ``A little bit more than a year ago . .
. I repeated the same. I said, 'OK, we have to get ready for a
close race.'''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo met with the editors just a month before Mexico's July 2
election, which is indeed expected to be the closest presidential
race in this country's modern history.
</P>
<P>
   Top opposition candidate Vicente Fox Quesada, is neck-in-neck
with Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the candidate of Zedillo's party.
</P>
<P>
   That party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has
controlled Mexico's presidency since 1929. Fox has mounted a
vigorous campaign that calls for change, and blames the PRI for
corruption and for leaving half the country impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said electoral reforms during his administration and
before have paved the way for more political competition in Mexico,
which has suffered from a reputation for electoral fraud and
vote-buying on behalf of the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason is very simple,'' Zedillo said when asked
why he thought his party was fighting so hard in this year's
election. ``The others have learned very well to compete with the
new rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign is being financed largely by public
funds this year. The candidates have equal access to buy time for
commercials in the media.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has noted improvements in coverage by a media
once completely under the PRI's thumb. But election officials are
still criticizing coverage in some media as biased toward the PRI,
especially in Mexico's provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has also complained that some federal social
service programs might be used in rural areas to induce votes for
the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo has denied any political manipulation of programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the middle of a very intense, highly competed
election,'' he said. ``But for me, the most important aspect of
that election is that it is being conducted with the rules and
institutions that fully guarantee citizens that their votes will be
counted . . . and will be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional ad follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo also talked to the editors about the investigation into
the December 1998 killing of Philip True, a Mexico-based reporter
for the San Antonio (Texas) Express-News newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Two suspects are in jail awaiting trial in Jalisco state, where
True was killed while on a trip to write about Huichol Indians.
</P>
<P>
   American Society of Newspaper Editors president Richard Oppel _
the editor of the Austin American-Statesman _ traveled to Jalisco
with other editors to meet with the state attorney general. They
were told a trial would probably start in three to five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was very sad,'' Zedillo said of True's killing.
``But I think that his case should not be interpreted as meaning
that journalists are not safe because they are journalists in this
country. Unfortunately, we have a security problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said, ``Mr. True went into this place, these rather
primitive communities with a very particular culture,'' and may not
have been aware of the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that full justice is made in this process,'' he said.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ The struggles of Chicago public schools seem a world
removed from North Side College Preparatory, a gleaming new high
school with six computers in every classroom, a 525-seat theater
and a student body loaded with academic stars.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways between classes one recent morning, a stereo
system serenaded the students with a jazz recording by Chuck
Mangione, ``Land of Make Believe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a suburban school inside the city, pretty preppy,''
said Damien Croteau-Chonka, a 15-year-old freshman who has already
built a thriving business as a Web site designer. ``We're elite
academically. But if you can get in here, you belong here.''
</P>
<P>
   North Side College Prep, a $44 million school nearing the end of
its first year, is Chicago's answer to parents who say they must
look to the suburbs or private institutions for a top-notch
education for their children.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, few suburban schools could compete with the academic
bona fides of the students at North Side College Prep. The median
test score for students entering the freshman class this fall was
in the 96th percentile nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But while virtually no one disputes the scholastic prowess of
North Side College Prep, some education experts and parents
question the fairness of lavishing such resources on the
academically gifted, especially when so many children in Chicago
are desperately lagging behind in other classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all kids are born with the ability to test well,'' said
Darlene Pearlstine, an elected representative to a Chicago public
school governing council. ``The system is telling those kids that
the other schools are for losers and rejects.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a notion is vehemently questioned by Paul Vallas, the head
of the Chicago public schools, who has been widely praised for
raising test scores and restoring discipline in classrooms all over
the city.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a dozen schools around Chicago, including several
in poor neighborhoods, Vallas has instituted special curriculums
for high-achieving students, known as international baccalaureate
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Side College Prep is only one small part of the
picture,'' he said. ``This is about giving more options to all the
families in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vallas is not backing away from the goal of creating elite
schools. This fall, another new top-shelf campus, the Walter Payton
College Preparatory School, will open on the affluent Near North
Side of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   By 2001, Chicago will offer six such magnet schools for
high-achieving students, including South Side College Prep, which
has been in operation for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Kati Hancock, the director of The Education Trust, a research
group in Washington that studies school issues, said there is ``no
secret about what's going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As the upper-middle class has more disposable income, there is
a greater pull by the private schools, and Paul Vallas is not the
only school leader looking for ways to compete and keep those
kids,'' Hancock said. ``There is a legitimate argument to be made
that you need to keep the tax base, and you need to attract the
children of influential citizens, or you lose support for public
education in cities. At the same time, there is a danger that we're
sending a very devastating message to the other students that we
just don't care about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some concerns have been raised about elite schools
siphoning off the best students and the best teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Other big cities, including Chicago, have operated
selective-admission public schools for many years. In New York, the
Bronx High School of Science and Stuyvesant High School are geared
toward the academic elite. San Francisco has the prestigious Lowell
High School. Boston Latin in Boston takes only the top students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not new to have these schools,'' Hancock said. ``What's
new in Chicago is that they're building more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the money spent on North Side College Prep, and the
admission standards, some critics have also argued that the racial
makeup of the school is absurdly out of proportion with that of the
school system.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where white students account for just 10 percent of
public school enrollment, 57 percent of the students at North Side
College Prep are white. The largest minority group at the school is
Asian-American, 17 percent, compared with 3 percent Asian-American
citywide.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Hispanic students, meanwhile, are sharply
underrepresented at North Side College Prep. It has 11 percent
Hispanic students, compared with 37 percent citywide, and 14
percent black students, compared with 53 percent citywide.
</P>
<P>
   Students at North Side College Prep are admitted solely on the
basis of test scores. And the competition has been fierce. For the
next school year, North Side accepted about 400 students, out of
some 3,000 applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The school has also been a powerhouse at recruiting teachers and
staff members. About 400 teachers applied for 37 slots. The
principal, James Lalley, spent several years as the principal at
St. Ignatius College Preparatory High School, considered the most
prestigious Roman Catholic school in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Lalley, the criticism about elitism at a Chicago
public school underscores the progress being made in the city's
educational system in recent years. He recalled the statement by
William Bennett, the former education secretary under President
Ronald Reagan, that Chicago schools were the ``worst in the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago schools have had such a bad reputation for so long,''
he said, ``that any success for anyone is good for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, North Side College Preparatory has demonstrated that
it can compete with private schools. About one-third of its
freshman class attended private schools last year.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Kletzing, 16, had planned to attend Luther North High
School, a private school, just as an older brother had done. His
parents had never considered sending their children to a public
school in Chicago. But when North Side College Prep opened, they
changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is top-notch, and it's free,'' said Aaron, who is a
star pitcher on the school baseball team. ``It's pretty simple. You
can get a better education here than at Luther North, and you don't
have to pay $5,000 in tuition.''

 &HT;    CNN celebrates 20 years

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ted Turner stood on the stage of Philips Arena
Thursday night and surveyed the 15,000 or so people in the stands
who had just finished giving him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have this many people for basketball games,'' he
joked.
</P>
<P>
   The night was no game, though it was frequently fun, as CNN
capped off a day-long celebration of its 20th anniversary with a
tribute to itself and a concert by Diana Ross and the Supremes, who
stepped in at the last minute for an ailing Rod Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done extremely well,`` Turner continued in a relaxed
mood. ``But I risked everything at every turn in the road, so I
deserve it all.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN filled the arena with loyal supporters _ old hands who
helped launch the network and have since departed, like Ed Turner,
Earl Casey and first president Reese Schonfeld; cable operators and
advertisers who supported CNN when it was widely seen as a
pipsqueak operation doomed to failure; and nearly all of its
current on-air talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long people thought this wouldn't work,'' analyst Jeff
Greenfield said backstage before the party started. ``To celebrate
20 years with this kind of blow-out is a way of saying, 'Hey, we
made it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen CNN anchors milled around the ``green room''
backstage before going on to pay tribute to the CNN world empire.
Meteorologist Flip Spiceland and Headline News anchor Lynne Russell
debated whether it was the original Supremes backing Ross (it
wasn't), and anchor Joie Chen, just back from maternity leave,
chatted with Leon Harris.
</P>
<P>
   After a 15-minute video timeline of CNN moments and fireworks,
the party's organizer, CNN-U.S. President Richard Kaplan aired a
compilation of other celebrities trying to say James Earl Jones'
signature line, ``This is CNN.'' Among those trying, but failing,
to equal Jones were Ellen DeGeneres, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, America Online Chairman Steve Case and Bugs Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor Bernard Shaw introduced Turner, saying he joined CNN in
1980 because, ``I saw it as the last frontier of television news.
But the pioneer was not just one network, it was one person.''
</P>
<P>
   After his brief remarks, Turner lamented that he had to leave
soon to go back to CNN Center and be interviewed by Larry King for
Thursday's two-hour retrospective. He not only missed most of
Ross's concert (which included all of her hits and four costume
changes), but the moment when she walked down to the front row of
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   There the video cameras caught AOL's Case in a Hawaiian shirt,
Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin dancing with his wife, and CNN's
Kaplan. Ross stuck her microphone into the executives' faces,
urging them to sing along to ``Stop! In the Name of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan was game, singing a few bars.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why, although CNN televises almost everything,
it decided in advance not to televise its own birthday party.

MICROSOFT JUDGE POSTPONES FINAL RULING FOR ABOUT A WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite and expand by 600 words.)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust
case unexpectedly agreed to delay his final ruling for about a week
Thursday, giving the Justice Department time to reply to
Microsoft's proposal to water down the government's breakup plan.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, had planned to issue his
final ruling, widely expected to call for a breakup of the company,
Thursday or Friday. But Justice Department officials called him
Thursday morning to ask if they could reply to Microsoft's comments
on the government's remedy proposal; the comments were filed with
the court on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The comments were supposed to be the final filing in the case,
the last step before Jackson's ruling. But in a conference call
Thursday morning with Microsoft and the government, Jackson gave
the Justice Department until Monday to respond, and Microsoft until
Wednesday to file a counterresponse. His ruling will probably come
almost immediately after that.
</P>
<P>
   During the remedy hearing in Jackson's courtroom on May 24, the
judge asked the federal and state governments that are partners in
the suit to file a final ``clean'' version of their remedy proposal
by May 26. The plaintiffs agreed, but a Microsoft lawyer, John
Warden, then said the company wanted an opportunity to ``comment on
the form of the proposed decree prior to its entry.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Microsoft lawyer, Steven Holley, said outside the
courthouse later that ``comment on the form'' meant looking for
typographical errors and ``internal inconsistencies'' in the
government plan.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Microsoft's response heavily revised the government
proposal _ gutting it, in the view of some government officials.
Some proposals the government viewed as important were deleted,
others were eviscerated, and the timetables for carrying them out
were lengthened _ doubled in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   The government plan would create two new companies; one would
hold the Windows operating systems, the other everything else,
including the Office suite of programs like Word for word
processing and Excel for spreadsheet calculations. It would also
impose restrictions on the company's conduct that would remain in
place while the breakup was being carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's brief explained that the changes were necessary
because the government proposal ``is vague and ambiguous in
numerous respects,'' littered with ``many flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Were the court to accept all of Microsoft's proposed
changes,'' the brief continued, ``the government's proposed final
judgment would be improved, but much of the vagueness and ambiguity
would remain because it is inherent in the structure of document.''
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray, said, ``We view our
revisions as putting lipstick on a pig.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivek Varma, another Microsoft spokesman representing the legal
department, said Warden ``had not misspoken'' in court. But ``we
had every intention of showing the inadequacies, including
substantively, in the government's proposed order,'' particularly
since Jackson rejected Microsoft's request for remedy hearings.
</P>
<P>
   During the conference call Thursday morning, David Boies, the
government's lead trial lawyer in the case, told the judge that the
Justice Department had found at least a few useful comments among
the dozens of proposed revisions in the Microsoft brief.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Murray leapt on that, saying, ``They told the court that
there wasn't any need for additional remedies hearings, and now it
turns out that there were defects and problems with their
proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   One participant in the call said Jackson was irritated by the
request for further delay; he has repeatedly said he wants to
conclude the case quickly and allow it go forward on appeal. But in
the end, he acceded to the request, after winning assurance from
both sides that this would be the final delay.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Talamona, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said,
``We believed that it was appropriate to request a short
opportunity to comment on Microsoft's specific changes, both to
determine whether there are a few that we can accept without
undermining our remedy proposal, while also offering our reasoning
for urging rejection by the court of the others.''
</P>
<P>
   In its filing on Monday, the Justice Department is certain to
oppose most of the substantive changes, like Microsoft's proposal
to delete the prohibition on continuing to offer special marketing
deals to certain computer manufacturers. In his ruling, Jackson
found that Microsoft had used the special deals to reward
cooperative companies and punish others that did not follow
Microsoft's directions on issues of importance to the company.
</P>
<P>
   But the department may choose to take into account Microsoft's
concerns about the timetable for the breakup plan. Microsoft noted
that the company would have to win approval for elements of the
plan from several federal agencies, including the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the IRS, as well as governments of
countries where the company has subsidiary offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obtaining such approvals,'' the Microsoft brief said, ``would
be a time-consuming process.''

COMPANIES PAY $1 MILLION IN HARASSMENT SUIT
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. said Thursday that it would pay $850,000 to
settle a lawsuit in which the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission charged managers at a Maryland food-processing plant
with egregious sexual harassment of 22 female workers from Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said four plant managers and two nonsupervisors
had engaged in systemic harassment that included exposing
themselves, demanding oral sex, and touching workers' breasts,
buttocks and genital areas. Commission officials said the
harassment lasted for four years and that there was one case of
rape.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff was pretty bad, and it seemed to be pervasive, all
over this large plant,'' said Regina Andrew, one of the lawyers at
the commission's Baltimore office who handled what became a class
action lawsuit. ``This was one of the worst sexual harassment cases
we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission said that numerous women at the plant in Laurel,
Md., were given menial or difficult work assignments after they
rejected the managers' sexual demands.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said that two pregnant women who rebuffed
advances were subsequently fired, and that managers would often
drive female workers home late at night, after the buses had
stopped running, and would then expose themselves or pressure the
women for sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case sends a clear message that wholesale violations of
the civil rights of the most vulnerable work force _ immigrant
women in low-wage jobs _ will not be tolerated,'' said Ida L.
Castro, chairwoman of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, Grace noted that it sold the plant in March
1996, a month before four workers first complained to the
commission. The company said that none of the accusations involved
any member of Grace's management or any current employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are settling this case because we think it is in the best
interests of our employees and our shareholders to put this matter
behind us,'' the company said. ``Grace has in place a very strong
policy prohibiting sexual harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Grace, which is based in Columbia, Md., sold the
plant to Townsends Inc., which operated the plant until it was
closed in April. The plant made a wide range of processed foods
including soup, cheesecake and poultry dishes.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement announced Thursday, Townsends, which
is based in Wilmington, Del., agreed to pay $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Willoughby, a lawyer for Townsends, said that even though
the harassment was before Townsends bought the plant, Townsends
dismissed two managers and demoted two other workers after
investigating the matter. He said Townsends also posted sexual
harassment notices in English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Willoughby said that Townsends agreed to pay 15 percent of the
overall liability.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said that after the first four women lodged
a complaint in April 1996, investigators found that the problem was
far more widespread, prompting the commission to bring the case as
a class action lawsuit.

EDITORIAL: SPEEDING THE ELIAN CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 2:
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit
has issued a sound ruling that takes an important step toward
bringing the Elian Gonzalez case to a proper and just conclusion.
The court ruled that the Immigration and Naturalization Service was
within its legal authority when it said that the young boy rescued
off the Florida coast last November cannot seek asylum on his own,
and that only his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, can speak for him.
Gonzalez has said he wants to take his child home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Given the appeals court decision, the boy's Miami relatives, who
have been fighting to keep Elian in the United States, should
accept the reality that he belongs with his father. The relatives
are entitled to ask for a re-hearing, but otherwise there is very
little legal basis for dragging out this bitter and destructive
case further. The case has already done damage to the image of the
Cuban-American community in Miami and subjected a young child to a
long sojourn away from home after the death of his mother at sea.
Elian has now spent more than a month living with his father,
stepmother and half-brother in the Washington area while awaiting
the appellate court decision.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision affirms the judgment that was issued in
March by Federal District Court Judge K. Michael Moore, and upholds
the decisions of Attorney General Janet Reno and the INS
commissioner in affirming the father's parental rights. Although
this page condemned the pre-dawn raid on the Miami relatives'
residence on April 22 as a matter of law enforcement tactics, the
relatives cannot now argue that they have not had their day in
court.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court found that the INS' decision that a
6-year-old child must be represented by an adult in asylum
proceedings, and that only a parent may speak for the child, absent
evidence of a clear conflict between the parent and the child, was
``reasoned and reasonable.'' Moreover, the court found that
Congress left the details of the asylum process to the discretion
of the executive branch, and that the authority of the executive
branch to fill in the policy details is especially great in the
immigration area.
</P>
<P>
   The court has given Elian's Miami relatives 14 days to request
that the case be reheard by all 12 judges of the appeals court. It
appears that Elian will be required to remain in the country for at
least that period. Lawyers for the relatives are also seeking
intervention by the Supreme Court to ensure that Elian will remain
in the United States until that court can consider an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Miami relatives should recognize that even if Elian were
allowed to apply for asylum on his own, it is highly unlikely that
his claim would be granted. Indeed, the INS has already made a
preliminary assessment that his claim would probably lack merit
because he would have to show a ``well-founded fear of
persecution'' in his home country, a difficult standard to meet.
</P>
<P>
   The courts should wrap up any remaining appeals requests as
quickly as possible. It is time for the federal authorities to
begin preparations to allow Elian and his family to go home.

BUSH'S FIRST REPRIEVE BLOCKS EXECUTION OF CONVICTED KILLER 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush signed off on his first
reprieve for a convicted killer Thursday, minutes before the man's
execution.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-day delay will allow Ricky Nolen McGinn time for DNA
retesting of crucial evidence in his 1993 capital murder case.
McGinn's execution was postponed so that the most advanced DNA
testing techniques could be used on evidence in the rape that
preceded the murder of his 12-year-old stepdaughter, Stephanie Rae
Flanary of Brownwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect for the courts and all relevant parties to act
expeditiously to review the evidence and to finally determine his
innocence or guilt as to the charge of rape,'' Bush said while
campaigning in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime DNA evidence can be used in its context and be
relevant as to the guilt or innocence of a person on death row, we
need to use it,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   If exonerated of the sexual assault, McGinn could have his death
penalty sentence reduced to life in prison or a lesser term.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn's reprieve, which expires at the end of June, was the
first granted for DNA retesting purposes since Bush took office in
1995. Bush has allowed a total of 131 executions, including 20 this
year, but in recent days he said he supports retesting if it could
exonerate a condemned inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the execution delay was recommended by Bush, the relief
was granted by the acting governor, state Sen. Rodney Ellis,
D-Houston, president pro tempore of the Texas Senate. The
politically charged decision fell on Ellis because both Bush and
Lt. Gov. Rick Perry were out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I am reluctant to second guess the verdict of a Texas
jury and our courts, we must be willing to take every step possible
to ensure that justice is done,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis disputed assertions that Bush recommended the reprieve to
promote his ``compassionate conservative'' bid for the GOP
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court each turned down McGinn's
appeals this week, leaving a one-time-only reprieve of 30 days as
his only available relief. The trial court has the authority to
further postpone the execution date if the sophisticated DNA
testing isn't completed. Ellis said there is some doubt whether it
can be done in 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn learned of his fate in Huntsville, where he was awaiting
lethal injection after 6 p.m. as ordered by his trial court in
Brownwood. Under what prosecutors called a ``tremendous'' amount of
incriminating evidence, the 42-year-old mechanic and carpenter was
convicted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who was in McGinn's sole care while her mother was out
of town, was found bludgeoned to death about three miles from
McGinn's home on May 22, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   An older type of DNA testing on McGinn's ax detected the girl's
blood and excluded 99.9999999 percent of possible donors, experts
said. His lawyers contend that retesting of a pubic hair found on
the girl's body and a semen stain on her clothing could exonerate
him of the sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   But Dianne Clements, president of the Houston-based Justice for
All, a crime victims' advocacy group, predicted the testing will
not change McGinn's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely believe that it will be his DNA. ... Nothing will
prove that McGinn did not rape and murder Stephanie Flanary,''
Clements said.
</P>
<P>
   She asserted that McGinn's plea for DNA retesting was an abuse
of the appeals process _ the same conclusion reached earlier this
week by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot as a society throw out traditional evidence ... and
rely on DNA because DNA does not tell the whole story _ his prior
sexual assaultive history; his molestation of another stepdaughter;
her blood on his clothing, his shoes, his pants, his car,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clements said the reprieve is ``devastating for the victim's
family. Once again, that defendant, that convicted killer, is in
control of their lives when they thought that would be
eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   For Austin attorney Rob Owen, McGinn's reprieve was bittersweet.
While relieved for McGinn, Owen couldn't help but think of his
client, Jerry Lee Hogue, who was executed two years ago after Bush
declined a similar DNA-based reprieve request. Hogue, proclaiming
his innocence, was executed in 1998 for the 1979 rape and murder of
Jayne Markham in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly begged the governor to give us the same 30 days
he's now giving Mr. McGinn,'' Owen said. ``If Jerry had had the
good fortune to hang around for two more years until the governor
was running for president, he might have gotten more serious
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen believes there aren't many death row inmates who would
benefit from a new round of DNA tests and doubts there will be any
surge in reprieves requested or granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case where there is any plausible claim that DNA
testing can make us more confident in the result, then we ought to
do it. But I think it is probably an exaggeration to say there are
going to be hundreds of cases. That's probably not going to
happen,'' the lawyer said.

 CITY OF S.F. SEEKS COMPETITIVE BIDS FOR BANK BUSINESS  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The city of San Francisco announced Thursday
that it is putting its banking business out for bid, a move that
jeopardizes an exclusive relationship with Bank of America that
goes back about 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Treasurer Susan Leal said her office is requesting
competitive bids for seven pieces of banking business, from
processing paychecks to handling credit card receipts for city
services. Bids will be due in July, and contracts should be awarded
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo and Union Bank of California said they will try to
win the business, setting up what may be a three-way contest to be
San Francisco's banker.
</P>
<P>
   Securing the city's banking contracts would hand the winners
big-league bragging rights. For BofA, which won the franchise when
founder A.P. Giannini headed a bank that was still called by its
original name, Bank of Italy, handling the city's business
symbolized the bank's status as the region's leading financial
institution.
</P>
<P>
   That is a position that Wells Fargo, now the biggest bank
headquartered in the West, would love to wrest from BofA. And San
Francisco's Union Bank, the perennial No. 3 in California, could
burnish its reputation by taking some of the city's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a trophy,'' said Fred Martin, BofA's former director
of government relations.
</P>
<P>
   Big-Time BofA
</P>
<P>
   Until now, BofA has managed San Francisco's primary bank
accounts and most of the rest of the city's banking operations on a
noncompetitive basis. Wells Fargo and Union currently sell
relatively minor banking services to the city.
</P>
<P>
   About $20 billion passes through San Francisco's various
accounts annually, and BofA collects fees totaling about $1
million, Leal estimated. By contrast, Wells Fargo and Union receive
about $60,000 and $12,000 a year, respectively, for the banking
services they provide to San Francisco, the treasurer's office
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leal's decision to request bids for banking services was not a
surprise, because the treasurer has previously disclosed that she
was weighing such action. In an interview yesterday, she explained
the move as prudent financial management. ``It was basically a
business decision to see that we get the best deal possible for the
city,'' Leal said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Tangle of Politics
</P>
<P>
   Still, observers said, it is impossible to separate business
considerations from the tangled politics of the city's relationship
with BofA.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half ago, North Carolina's NationsBank bought San
Francisco's BofA and took its name. After originally promising a
``merger of equals,'' the new owners treated the old BofA as a
junior partner and forced out many of the California bank's top
executives, including former Chief Executive David Coulter.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, including Mayor Willie Brown and Board of
Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, questioned how much the
acquiring bank would remain committed to the San Francisco
community once it was headquartered across the continent. And the
bank's attempts to impose its culture on its tradition-bound
acquisition touched off controversies over such matters as the mass
departure of senior female managers of the old BofA.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Hard-Nosed Approach
</P>
<P>
   That history ``makes it easier now to be a little hard-nosed''
in negotiating the city's banking business, said Mary Callanan, who
was San Francisco treasurer from 1980 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Leal herself has raised nonbusiness issues in her dealings with
BofA. At the beginning of the year, for example, she wrote to the
bank asking for information about local job cuts after the
takeover, information she said the city was entitled to ``as one of
(BofA's) largest customers in California.'' The bank supplied the
information several weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, BofA put a brave face on what may be the end of
its special relationship with San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The treasurer has said for some time she would try to put the
city's banking business out for bid, and we've always said that's a
good idea,'' said BofA spokesman Peter Magnani. ``We expect we'll
win our fair share`` of competitive bids.
</P>
<P>
   Still, BofA has not yet decided whether it will bid on all seven
of the city's banking contracts, Magnani said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, BofA and the city turned into partners whose
interests became increasingly intertwined. The bank agreed to
handle low-profit businesses, such as cashing welfare checks. The
city, in turn, kept most of its business with BofA.
</P>
<P>
   Prickly Relationship
</P>
<P>
   Like squabbling spouses, the relationship persisted even as the
city and other municipalities were suing the bank for hundreds of
millions of dollars over what they said was fraudulent
mismanagement of municipal bond accounts. That suit was settled in
1998, when BofA agreed to pay the plaintiffs $187 million.
</P>
<P>
   Leal's office expects half a dozen or more financial
institutions to bid on the city's banking contracts. But most
observers expect the main competition will come from BofA, Wells
Fargo and Union.
</P>
<P>
   Union, whose majority owner is Japan's Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,
said it plans to bid on all seven contracts. ``We have the smallest
amount of the city's business,'' said Donna Hodgson, manager of the
bank's government services division. ``We hope when this whole
process is completed, we'll have the largest share.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo has also girded to compete. Last October, the bank
formed a special government and educational banking division and
made winning San Francisco's business a top priority. Dick
Kovacevich, the bank's chief executive, met with Leal several
months ago, urging her to give Wells Fargo a shot at the business,
the treasurer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be aggressive in soliciting the city's
business,'' said Wells Fargo spokeswoman Mary Rodrigues.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the final result, the era when BofA had a lock on San
Francisco's banking business is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``BofA was always very civic minded,'' said former city
treasurer Callanan. ``They were a hometown bank. They were
employing people here,'' she said. When it came time to negotiate
the city's business, ``that certainly was in the back of my mind.''

 DREAMTIME LANDS NASA DEAL  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ NASA is set to name a private company to take
over production and distribution of images from space, and a San
Francisco startup has reportedly won the nod.
</P>
<P>
   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin and an array of other agency
bigwigs are scheduled to appear Friday at a news conference at
NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., to announce
an ``unprecedented public-private partnership for multimedia and
space imagery.''
</P>
<P>
   A NASA spokesman declined to provide details, but Space.com, a
Web site that focuses on space-related subjects, this week reported
that the agency has chosen Dreamtime, a little-known San Francisco
company, to produce its film, video, still photography and Internet
programming.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, according to Space.com, calls for Dreamtime to provide
high-definition television (HDTV) equipment to beam video and
stills from the $60 billion International Space Station and the
shuttles that are helping to build it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company will be responsible for digitizing and
cataloging up to 40,000 hours of video, 10 million still images and
10 million feet of film from NASA archives.
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of a NASA push to get private companies to
invest in its work.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamtime could not be reached for comment.

 FIBER-OPTICS COMPANIES AT FOREFRONT OF IPO PACK  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two Bay Area companies dipped their toes into
the empty public offering swimming pool Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One dog-paddled, the other did the 1,000-meter butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   After first looking for a $16-a-share initial offering price,
Burlingame, Calif.'s CrossWorlds Software on Thursday opened at $10
and edged up an anemic 13 cents by the end of regular trading.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, which makes software for integrating
electronic-business software from multiple vendors, raised about
$40 million.
</P>
<P>
   ONI Systems, a San Jose, Calif., maker of fiber-optics gear,
firmly occupied the other end of the IPO spectrum Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After boosting its initial price 56 percent last month _ to $25
_ the San Jose firm's stock skyrocketed to $82.56. Its 230 percent
gain was the best-performing IPO in months and helped ONI rake in
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Nasdaq Stock Market's multiple swoons in April,
interest in IPOs has been scarce to nonexistent. Of the half-dozen
firms planning this week to sell their stock to the public for the
first time, four lowered their offerings _ some by as much as a
third.
</P>
<P>
   CrossWorlds, which had originally hoped to bring in about $64
million with its IPO, had $19 million in sales last year. But the
company's management has changed in recent months and it faces
stiff competition from the likes of Santa Clara, Calif.'s Active
Software and Sunnyvale, Calif.'s Vitria Technology, which both had
strong IPOs last year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say ONI's rise reflects investors' continued love
affair with fiber-optics companies, one of the few sectors to
generate enthusiasm as yesterday's shining stars, dot-coms, come to
resemble black holes more and more every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the overall market for IPOs has been slow,
communications infrastructure IPOs have remained very hot,'' said
Tim Savageaux, senior research analyst at WR Hambrecht. ``Maybe
they're not as hot as they would have been two months ago, but
they've still been extraordinarily successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Savageaux points to other early highfliers like Santa Clara,
Calif.'s New Focus. Though it fell $3.60 yesterday, the
fiber-optics components-maker gained 155 percent in its premiere
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Investors believe fiber optics hold the key to the Web's
potential for becoming a full-fledged communications and commerce
medium because glass fiber handles data much more efficiently than
does traditional copper wire.
</P>
<P>
   ONI also has some big names behind it. Among its shareholders
are Silicon Valley venture capital powerhouse Kleiner Perkins
Caufield &AMP; Byers and Mohr, Davidow Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, which owns 11 percent of ONI
after the offering, has backed companies including America Online
and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ONI Systems trades under the symbol ONIS. CrossWorlds' ticker
symbol is CWLD.

 PACIFIC BELL, AT&AMP;T RAISE RATES  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Starting Friday, Pacific Bell plans to boost the
price for several optional calling plans and features, including 69
and three-way calling.
</P>
<P>
   The price for basic service and many other calling features
won't change, said Pac Bell spokesman John Britton. But the
increase irked some consumer advocates, especially coming just days
after the company won a $13 million property-tax break from the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The phone company notified the Public Utilities Commission a
month ago of its plans, but the regulatory agency opted not to
challenge the increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no justification for these increases,''
said Tom Stein, a lawyer for the Utility Reform Network in San
Francisco. ``These custom calling features cost almost nothing
extra to provide. This is pure gravy.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate hikes will affect:
</P>
<P>
   -- Three packages that include Caller ID and other custom
calling features. ``Basic Saver'' and the ``Basics'' will jump $3
to $19.95 a month. The ``Works,'' which also includes voice mail,
will jump $3 to $27.90
</P>
<P>
   -- Three custom-calling features (repeat dialing; three-way
calling; and 69, which is used to call the last person who dialed
your number). The cost for each feature will be 95 cents per use,
an increase of 20 cents.
</P>
<P>
   -- Calling-card calls, which will cost at least 50 cents, up
from 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   -- Two calling plans (``Saver 60'' and ``Saver Plus'') that
cover calls to numbers farther than 12 miles away but too short to
be considered long-distance will jump. Prices for extra minutes
will jump by a penny each.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Wirepro,'' an inside wiring maintenance protection plan,
which increases 70 cents to $1.99 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said the inside wiring plan is still cheaper than the
national average, which is $2.52 per month. He also said the price
for individual features, like Caller ID and call waiting, won't
change. But he said the packages are still a better deal, even
after the price increases, for consumers who want several of the
features.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell isn't the only company raising rates. AT&AMP;T boosted
rates yesterday for operator-assisted calls and calling cards. Some
examples:
</P>
<P>
   -- Operator-assisted collect and third-party fees will increase
to $4.99, up $1.04, when an automated system is involved. With a
live operator, the price for third-party calls will increase to
$9.95, up from $6.95.
</P>
<P>
   -- Per-minute calls on standard AT&AMP;T cards will increase to 69
cents, up from a range of 30 cents to 59 cents.
</P>
<P>
   -- Service charges for direct-dialed calls using a calling card,
ranging from 30 cents to $2.25, will increase to between 99 cents
and $4.95. Operator-assisted calls, which now cost between $2.95
and $3.45, will now cost $5.50.
</P>
<P>
   Stein called the increases ``sneaky,'' because many consumers
may not be aware of them. AT&AMP;T, however, said it placed
advertisements outlining the increases in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokeswoman Jane Young also said most customers would be
unaffected by the changes because relatively few place
operator-assisted calls. And heavy calling-card users are usually
enrolled in special calling plans with lower rates, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As always, we encourage people to dial direct,'' she said.
Young also advised consumers to consider buying prepaid
long-distance cards instead of using calling cards to keep bills
down.

<HEADLINE>
EDITORIAL: THE FCC'S OWNERSHIP RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 2:
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission, under heavy political
pressure, is preparing to loosen rules that limit the ability of
television broadcasters to own other communications properties.
This is a bad idea. There is no evidence that weakening the rules
will help consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the rules exist to preserve something precious and
fragile in a democracy _ the diversity of information that flows
into everyone's home. The commission already has all the power it
needs to grant exemptions where necessary.
</P>
<P>
   One important rule prevents a network from buying another
network. The commission recently invoked the rule to require
Viacom, which recently purchased CBS, to divest itself of UPN, a
newer, financially weak network. Those who want to soften the rule
argue that UPN can thrive only if it combines with another network
with which it can share costs. But turning to CBS to save UPN
creates a bigger CBS, without necessarily preserving a valuable
independent voice for news and entertainment. If the commission can
prove that an independent UPN can survive only by combining with
CBS, then it has the legal power to reverse its earlier ruling and
grant a well-argued waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Another key rule prevents a broadcaster from owning a newspaper
in the same city. The commission appears poised to lift that rule
in large cities, like New York, where joint ownership poses little
threat because several newspapers and television stations coexist.
The immediate issue is the Tribune Co.'s agreement to buy Times
Mirror, which would give the Tribune ownership of newspapers and
television stations in three cities, including New York. There it
would own Newsday, the Long-Island-based daily that circulates in
the city, and WPIX, a television station already owned by the
Tribune Co.
</P>
<P>
   But the argument for relaxing the rule is weak. The commission
can and does grant exemptions in the rare instances where a local
newspaper's sole chance for survival is to be purchased by a
broadcaster. The commission ruled in this fashion to allow Rupert
Murdoch, who already owned a New York television station, to buy
The New York Post. By loosening the rule for large cities, the
commission would in effect grant a blanket waiver without the need
to prove the case. Threats to diversity need not be put on such
automatic pilot.
</P>
<P>
   A third rule, which the commission does not seem prepared to
change, prevents broadcasters from owning stations that reach more
than 35 percent of households in the country. This is a sound rule
for preserving diversity of ownership, even in a time when cable is
eroding broadcast boundaries. Weakening the rule could, for
example, stifle the voice of independent programmers. Programmers
who refuse to conform to the tastes of a huge broadcaster, one
whose reach extends well beyond the 35 percent figure, could find
themselves shut out of too many of the nation's homes to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Any media company has an interest in the commission's decisions,
and The New York Times Co. is no exception. A change in the
commission's rules could affect the business activities of the
Times Co., which owns The New York Times, 23 other newspapers and 8
television stations. But the issue is not the well-being of the
Times Co. or any other company, but rather the preservation of a
diverse group of independent sources for news and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The rules that govern concentration in telecommunications are
unlike antitrust laws. In the bottled water and sneaker markets,
mergers are allowed unless antitrust authorities can prove that
added concentration would do harm. If the authorities err, and
permit excessive consolidation, about all that happens is that the
price of bottled water rises and innovation slacks off in the
design of sneakers. But in telecommunications, the threat that
concentration might shut off sources of information is profound.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has no legal obligation to bend over backward on
behalf of the telecommunications industry. Instead, it is charged
with protecting the public interest. Before the commission changes
its rules, it needs to prove that ordinary citizens will benefit
from the change. So far, that case does not exist.

 NEW GRADS WEIGH JOBS AT STARTUPS  &HT;     By JENNIE YABROFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last fall, Heather Zehren-Albinson thought her
future was clear.
</P>
<P>
   She would finish her master's degree in business administration
at the University of California at Berkeley this spring before
heading to work for the New York investment bank where she was an
intern last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans started to unravel when her husband, Tim Albinson,
who graduated from UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business in 1999,
left his investment banking job to start his own Internet-related
company.
</P>
<P>
   With her prospective banking job looking pretty dull by
comparison, Heather caught Tim's startup fever and began
interviewing with startups.
</P>
<P>
   But with the wild gyrations in the stock market, she had second
thoughts. Now she is leaning toward taking the job offer with the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a huge risk with Tim's company, so for the
stability factor, I'll probably take the more secure banking job,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Heather's class of MBAs, the intoxication of being wooed by
fledgling companies is dampened by a sobering turn of events on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   While most graduates remain optimistic about the possibilities
that startups offer, they are much more cautious about signing away
their futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart MBAs are kicking a lot of tires before deciding to go
with a startup,'' Albinson said. ``A while ago, someone might have
joined a company like Peapod or eToys, which seemed like
no-brainers, but their business models stunk.''
</P>
<P>
   (Shares of Peapod, which lost $120 million in financing in
March, are trading at around $2, a 78 percent drop-off in the past
12 months. Meanwhile shares of eToys, which hasn't turned a profit,
have dropped 90 percent in the past year to about $5.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people are looking at business models more carefully,
checking out the funding, (and) making sure the founders have a
strategy for differentiating their business from the rest of what's
out there,'' Tim Albinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Albinson's startup, Exchangewave, helps online businesses
connect with customers. The company has raised $500,000 in capital
so far and is working on a second round of funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get e-mails everyday from friends asking how I'm weathering
starting a business in the midst of the (stock market) carnage,''
he said. ``But I've interviewed 25 MBAs in the past month who want
to come work for us. They're still confident that startups can
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one denies that the bearish turn on Wall Street has
meant bad news for tech stocks and the startups they finance, this
year's business school graduates are putting the best face possible
on the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good correction,'' said Che Mott, who graduated from
Haas last month and now works for Exchangewave.
</P>
<P>
   Although traditional jobs for MBAs like investment banking or
consulting offer more stability and higher salaries, the lure of
startups remains strong. More than twice as many MBAs from
Stanford's Graduate School of Business started their own companies
in 1999 as 1998, and that trend seems to be continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Sherrie Taguchi, director of the Career Management Center at
Stanford's business school, said 12 percent of the school's
graduates founded their own startups last year, and the number
could be as high as 15 percent for the class of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   High tech and venture capital top the list of industries
attracting graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weaker companies are being impacted by the market,
especially ones without good funding and good revenues,'' Taguchi
said. ``But our students are very thoughtful and do their due
diligence and homework. They know what to look for.''
</P>
<P>
   What business school graduates are looking for doesn't always
include a big paycheck. MBAs going into traditional jobs like
management consulting, investment banking, brokerage and real
estate can expect to make $100,000 to $200,000 a year in their
first year out of school.
</P>
<P>
   Startups offer considerably less, with first-year salaries
starting in the $55,000 range, and entrepreneurs starting their own
companies aren't guaranteed a salary at all.
</P>
<P>
   Taguchi said the top three job criteria that students look for
are
</P>
<P>
   whom they will be working for, how much intellectual stimulation
the position offers and the opportunity for advancement.
Compensation ranks fifth on the list.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for startups, which can't offer the same
salaries as more established companies. But the use of stock
options by startups to lure employees has lost some luster during
the recent market downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job candidates are becoming more aware that there are a lot of
worthless options out there,'' said Steve Anderson, a consultant at
the Palo Alto, Calif., venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins
Caufield and Byers who works with startups.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Pfeifer, who graduates with an MBA from Stanford this
month and plans to work for a high-tech startup, agrees. ``People
are seeing that relying solely on stock options as a get-rich-quick
solution is not a good way to pick a company,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the possibility of lower salaries, less job security and
stock options of uncertain value, MBAs still can't resist the siren
songs of startups. They say the opportunity to help shape a company
and the freedom to create their own destiny are worth the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two years of school, MBAs want a chance to flex their
brains and the skills they've acquired,'' Albinson said. ``Going to
work for an established company, even an Internet company like
Yahoo, gives you very little opportunity to steer the direction of
the business.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife agrees, sounding wistful.
</P>

   ``There might be more opportunities in banking right now,
because they're losing people to startups. And I will make more
money at a bank,'' she said. ``But part of me really wants to be
involved in the new Internet economy. I want to feel like I was
there.''

CUBAN BOY'S MIAMI RELATIVES LOSE RULING ON ASYLUM HEARING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Elian Gonzalez will remain in the United States for at
least two more weeks even after a federal appeals court Thursday
refused to order a political asylum hearing for the fought-over
Cuban child.
</P>
<P>
   Elian could be forced to stay longer if the Miami relatives who
are seeking asylum for the child over his Cuban father's objections
pursue further appeals. Attorney Kendall Coffey said his clients
were giving an appeal to the Supreme Court ``serious
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives could also request a rehearing before the
same three-judge panel that issued Thursday's ruling, or before the
entire 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal. But Thursday's decision
made it clear the family has only 14 days to decide whether to
request a rehearing at that level. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Expect no extensions,'' the court instructed.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling follows six months of international family
infighting, political recriminations and wide-spread protests in
both Miami and Cuba over the fate of the 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   His mother died trying to smuggle Elian out of Cuba, and it has
been difficult for family members, Miami community leaders and many
politicians to separate attitudes about Cuban leader Fidel Castro
from the legal issues involved.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate ruling made it clear the court takes no joy in
lifting an obstacle to Elian's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acknowledge, as a widely accepted truth, that Cuba does
violate human rights and fundamental freedoms and does not
guarantee the rule of law to people living in Cuba,'' wrote Judge
J.L. Edmonson, on behalf of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   But the Immigration and Naturalization Service's decision to
deny Elian an asylum hearing was ``within the outside border of
reasonable choices,'' the opinion read. ``The court neither
approves nor disapproves the INS' decision to reject the asylum
applications filed on plaintiff's behalf, but the INS decision did
not contradict (federal law.)''
</P>
<P>
   The judges denied, however, a request by Elian's father to name
him instead of great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez as Elian's
representative in the continued court proceedings. Making Juan
Miguel Gonzalez his son's legal representative would have allowed
him to simply drop the asylum request and head for home.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle vowed to continue the battle, and said the
Miami relatives might sue for visitation while the child is in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will keep fighting with the laws ... so Elian Gonzalez can
live in a free country like his mother wanted,'' Lazaro Gonzalez
said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno praised the
ruling, with both stressing their confidence that Juan Miguel
Gonzalez is the best person to raise his child. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``As I've said before, this is a case about the importance of
family and the bond between a father and son,'' Clinton said in a
written statement issued from Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father asked his Miami relatives to end their court
battle after Thursday's ruling and allow him to finally return home
with his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child should simply be with his parents, always his
parents,'' the elder Gonzalez said through an interpreter.
Switching to English, he said, ``I want to thank the American
people. Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida by two American
fishermen last November after the boat he was in capsized. Elian's
mother and 10 others died, but the boy survived by clinging to an
inner tube.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives took in the child, but then refused to
return him to his surviving father in Cuba, citing the harshness of
the Castro regime.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives applied for political asylum on Elian's
behalf, saying the child did not want to return to Cuba. INS agents
traveled to Cuba to interview the child's father before the INS
rejected the application for asylum, saying the child's father was
the only person authorized to represent him. A district court judge
upheld the federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives appealed that decision, and obtained an
injunction requiring Elian to remain in the United States until the
asylum question worked its way through the courts. Juan Miguel
Gonzalez arrived in the United States April 2, and Reno ordered the
Miami relatives to surrender the child to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The family refused, and federal agents took the child by force
in a pre-dawn raid on the Miami relatives' home on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   The father and his son lived for a month on a large, private
estate in Maryland, but have recently moved to an affluent
neighborhood in Washington, D.C., to wait out the rest of their
time in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the appellate panel released its decision,
attorney Coffey filed an emergency request to Supreme Court Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy (who has jurisdiction over such matters from
Florida) requesting assurance that Elian will remain in the United
States until the full Supreme Court can consider a formal appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno said the request to Kennedy serves no purpose since the
injunction blocking Elian's return to Cuba still applies. If the
family fails to file an appeal within 14 days, she said, the
soonest Elian would be free to leave the country would be seven
days later.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice Department officials said the appellate court
could decide to waive the extra seven-day period.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters were beginning to gather outside the Miami relatives'
home even before the ruling was issued. They yelled and wept when
the decision was announced.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read on Cuban television, Castro's government
expressed its displeasure at still another delay in Elian's return.
The government called the 14-day waiting period ``another
concession to the `mafia' _ a disparaging term the government
frequently uses to describe Miami's exile Cuban community.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, a Cuban exile
group that frequently rescues Cuban refugees from the Straits of
Florida, called the latest ruling ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The saga of Elian Gonzalez is a turning point in relations in
the Cuban community and the United States,'' Basulto said. ``This
day, in the history of their relations with the United States, will
be remembered in the Cuban community in the same way the Bay of
Pigs is remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban exiles failed to overthrow Castro in 1961 when the
communist leader repelled their invasion at the Bay of Pigs.

 &HT;    Brazill's family breaks silence
 &HT;    By William Cooper Jr.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Polly Powell, the mother of Nathaniel
Brazill who is accused of killing a popular middle school teacher,
spoke publicly Thursday, defending her son and her parenting
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ask myself is it something that I missed,'' said
Powell, 34, speaking at a news conference held at the Public
Defender's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can a mother do when you try and raise your child the
best you can and something like this happens,'' said Powell,
breaking down and crying.
</P>
<P>
   Her 13-year-old son has been charged by police with first-degree
murder in the fatal shooting of Barry Grunow, a popular Lake Worth
Middle School English teacher on May 26, the last day of school.
Brazill is being held at the juvenile detention center in West Palm
Beach, awaiting for a grand jury to decide what he should be
charged with and whether he should be charged as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, Powell and Nathaniel Brazill Sr., spoke publicly
for the first time nearly a week after the shooting. They said they
have been silent out of respect for Grunow's widow and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Grunow had just passed away and we did not want to
interfere with the family and their time of grief and mourning,''
the boy's father said, clutching a blue leather Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said she also wanted to pay respect to Grunow's widow
Pam. ``One day when some of this cools down, I can go to her house
so I can give her a hug and let her know that I'm truly sorry that
it had to be my child, anybody's child, that takes a life of a
teacher. I feel for her and my heart just goes out to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell said her son gave no indication when the day started May
26 that anything might be amiss. For her the day began as often did
_ with her having to leave her Lake Worth home before Nathaniel got
up for school. Her job as assistant food services director at
Bishop Gray Inn, a Lake Worth retirement home, often required her
to leave by 6:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Later that morning, she called her son to make sure he was
getting ready to go to school. He was awake, but he wasn't dressed
for school, Powell recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She called back later, when her mother, Everlena Josey, arrived
to make sure her son got off to school. Josey also cares for
Powell's 2-year-old daughter, Ebony, while she and her husband,
Marshall Powell, work. Although Powell moved out in January, he has
since returned.
</P>
<P>
   About mid-day, while she was at work, Polly Powell received a
call from the school, saying that her son was being sent home for
throwing water balloons. She figured he would go to Josey's house.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill did go there, but only to get the key to his family's
apartment, where he got the gun used in the shooting, police have
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Powell came home from work about 3:30 p.m., she hoped to
see her son. She had heard about the shooting at her son's school
from a neighbor and was concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing earlier that my son was sent home (from school) all I
wanted to do was find him and make sure he was okay,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't there, so she went to her mother's house. He wasn't
there either.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said she assumed their paths had crossed while she was on
her way to Josey's house, so she returned home. Hoping he would
arrive any moment, she took a shower. The telephone rang. Her
sister said to call their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were calling my mother's house saying it was
Nathaniel,'' said Powell, who was told by her mother to head to the
Lake Worth Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   At the police station, Powell asked if her son was being held
there. She said she asked three times before police took her to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hugged him, cried and asked him was he okay,'' Powell
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the police told her not to ask her son any questions.
After two hours at the station, police asked her to leave because
they going to take him to the Juvenile Assessment Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just numb,'' she said. ``It's too shocking to even
imagine. The thought of your child who you know, you raised the
best you can, has taken somebody's life.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, who now lives in Daytona Beach, learned about the
shooting from his sister, who telephoned him from Lake Worth. The
boy's father, a postal worker, was doing volunteer work at his
church, Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church when he got the call.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had seen his son just a few weeks before, while he
was visiting the Lake Worth home of his parents, George and Ida
Brazill. He said he typically keeps up with his son through his
parents and sees him only when he visits them.
</P>
<P>
   Now Powell says she speaks to her son daily. He gets to make two
calls a day, one in the morning and one in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   He's asked her to send him a picture of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Neither parent has asked him about the shooting, they said. They
say they don't want to upset him. Their role, they say, is just to
be supportive.
</P>
<P>
   His father, however, said he believes the shooting was an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible, terrible accident,'' the elder Brazill
said. ``He never intentionally pulled that trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nate was a child that was playing with something that was
deadly,'' his father said. ``He didn't know the ramifications of
it. And the gun went off. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither parent wants Brazill tried as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Both parents describe their son as a bright student, with plenty
of ambition and not a bad bone in his body. He was boy who took a
liking to computers at age 4 while he was in pre-school, his mother
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Christmas, she had bought him a Gateway computer as a
gift because ``he had been so good in school and been good with me
through my breast cancer.'' According to his mother, Brazill went
on the Internet and order information about becoming a Secret
Service agent, a career he said he hoped to pursue. She allowed him
about 1 1/2 hours a day on the computer, during which time he like
to play simulated fighter pilot games and other less violent ones.
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of their son's attorney, Assistant Public
Defender, Randy Berman, the parents didn't discuss how their son
got the gun. Police said he took the gun from Elmore McCray's home
in Boynton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   McCray, 75, is the father of the godmother of the young Brazill.
The boy stayed at the McCray house on occasion, his mother said. He
and the elder McCray, whom he called ``Grand,'' would mow the lawn
together and ride bikes, his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her son attended McCray's 75th birthday party on May 13,
which drew a busload of relatives from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, Powell left her son with the McCrays while
she and her mother went to Bishopville, S.C. for five days to look
at property that had been left to the family, Powell said. Powell
returned to Lake Worth late May 23, and her son returned home the
next day, just two days before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it appears that Powell had a support system of
relatives and close friends who invested in her son's life. But
early her son's life there was domestic problems in the home, court
records show.
</P>
<P>
   Powell has been named in 17 domestic incident reports in the
past six years. The reports detail arguments between her and
Marshall Powell, and fights between her and her previous husband,
Wainford Whitefield.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some of her past problems, Powell said her son was
raised properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My child wasn't a monster,'' she said. ``I know I did the best
I could. I just pray that everybody realizes that he is a child.''

 NET WORTH: CHINA STILL A SLEEPING STOCK GIANT  &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ U.S. mutual funds that invest in China got a
boost from positive news on the trade front late last month. But
the gains evaporated after investors started focusing on the grim
realities of investing in one of the world's least-developed stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Even though mainland China has the world's best-performing
markets year to date _ the Shanghai index is up 50 percent and the
Shenzhen index is up 32 percent _ China mutual funds are showing
losses, mainly because most of their assets are in Hong Kong, which
is down 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most investment pros agree that over the long term, China will
benefit greatly from its inclusion in the World Trade Organization
and improved trade relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, China's entry into the WTO cleared a major hurdle
when the European Union voted to let it in.
</P>
<P>
   And on May 24, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill
granting China permanent normal trade relations. The PNTR bill goes
to the Senate this month.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these developments, assuming they gain final approval,
will gradually reduce tariffs and eliminate barriers to foreign
investment, which will increase trade between China and the rest of
the world and strengthen China's economy.
</P>
<P>
   But change won't come quickly, and while many Chinese companies
will prosper in a more open market, others will lose out to foreign
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Roz Hewsenian, a vice president with Wilshire Associates who
advises pension funds on foreign investments, says the Chinese
people will probably benefit before foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lag between when a country develops economically and
when it develops a stock market,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Mainland China lacks shareholder protections such as clearly
defined property rights, accounting standards, disclosure
requirements and market regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you trade in the U.S., England, France, even Taiwan, Poland
or some Latin American countries, the amount of disclosure and
regulation is sufficient that you, as a small investor, can feel
reasonably protected,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in China. ``In terms of market regulation, it ranks at
the bottom of our list of 30 to 35 developing countries.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why many U.S.-based China funds put most of their money
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We vastly prefer Hong Kong to mainland China,'' says Jim
Atkinson, managing director of Investec Guinness Flight, which has
funds that invest in both markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the mainland Chinese companies are state-owned
enterprises in smokestack industries. And the transparency
(accounting, disclosure, etc.) is not as high as we'd like,'' he
says. In Hong Kong, ``there's a lot more transparency and less
reliance on smokestack industries. Hong Kong will do well if China
does well.''
</P>
<P>
   He says Guinness is bullish on the region, but not just because
of the WTO. ``The region, particularly (mainland) China, is going
through a transformation that is moving the economy from agrarian
to industrial and post-industrial in a very short time.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, about 10 percent of the people in mainland China
have a fixed-line phone, and almost 5 percent have a mobile phone.
Starting in April, more people signed up for cellular than regular
phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have the legacy infrastructure of old
telecommunications,'' says Chris Legallet, manager of the Newport
Greater China fund. ``That could make them more flexible, more
nimble as an economy going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Legallet says that most U.S. investors have focused on China's
export prowess. ``They're moving up the value-added scale very
quickly, starting in garments and moving into technology. They have
a highly productive, low-cost workforce.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``the domestic market is still very, very underdeveloped. At
the end of the day, exports don't drive growth, domestic economy
does.''
</P>
<P>
   That, he says, is where the real potential lies. Even in a
slump, China's economic growth far exceeds that of most developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   China's growth rate in gross domestic product has been
declining, from 10 percent at the beginning of the 1990s to about 7
percent last year. This year's stock market gains follow several
years of big losses.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gao, co-portfolio manager of the Matthews Dragon Fund in
San Francisco, thinks China has recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Exports grew 39 percent in the first four months of this year,
and the first-quarter GDP grew 8.1 percent. ``We think this will be
the first year since 1992 that the growth rate goes up,'' says Gao.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Matthews, chief investment officer of the Matthews funds,
is also encouraged ``by the emergence of two or three Chinese
companies as globally eligible investments.''
</P>
<P>
   They include China Telecom, the nation's largest cellular
provider; Legend Holdings, the largest PC-maker and distributor in
China; and China Unicom, the second-largest cellular provider,
which is about to go public on the Hong Kong and New York stock
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If even one Chinese company can earn that sort of
international recognition, we see no reason why a larger number of
companies can't,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But even China boosters admit that the nation poses very
significant political, economic and currency risks. Foremost among
them are China's record on human rights and its unsettled
relationship with Taiwan, which has drawn threats of war from
Beijing by flirting with the idea of declaring independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``How that's resolved over time is a risk,'' says Legallet,
although he says the two countries ``are becoming so economically
intertwined it's going to be hard for them not to acknowledge each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   China could also get involved in a political skirmish with Tibet
or even Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Schapiro, manager of the Wells Fargo International Equity
Fund, just returned from an investment conference in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Hong Kong with the hope of coming back really
energized about investing in the region. I'm not as energized as I
thought I'd be,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enormous potential there. The young generation are
very excited, well educated and more exposed to the rest of the
world through TV and the Internet. The Chinese culture has become
more supportive of entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there still are structural problems: high debt levels,
regulations and restrictions on investments. They still have a lot
of problems trying to deal with state-owned enterprises. The
banking system is in terrible shape. And they still have to develop
a pension system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state used to take care of everybody. As more companies
become privately owned, they have to transfer some pension scheme
onto these companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of WTO, she says, are going to take place over
three to five years. ``Any investor has to have patience and a
fairly long time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rocco, who follows China funds for Morningstar, has the
same concerns. That's why he thinks investors should avoid funds
that invest exclusively in China or any other country.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single-country fund is just much, much, much, much, much too
narrow for most investors. I would argue that region funds are much
too narrow for most investors.''
</P>
<P>
   However, ``If you want to think of it is a speculative
investment for a small part of a portfolio, that's OK, if you can
handle the kind of volatility you're going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would ``gamble'' money in an Internet fund or a
China fund, Rocco chose the former. ``I buy the Internet story more
than I buy the China story,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson, whose firm also manages an Internet fund, says he
would chose the Net fund ``if I wanted to be really speculative. If
I wanted to be more conservative, I'd go with a China fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Schapiro says, ``I'd put it in a China fund. The Internet is
exciting ... but we don't know yet how anybody's going to make
money on it. In China, there are companies that do make money and I
think you're buying them at a lower valuation than Internet
companies.''

BLACK SECRET SERVICE AGENTS SAY AGENCY TRIED TO INTIMIDATE THEM
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for a group of black agents who have filed
a racial discrimination lawsuit against the Secret Service asked a
federal judge Thursday to stop what they said were efforts by the
agency to intimidate their clients.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said the retaliation had taken several forms,
including forced transfers to jobs with less responsibility and
warnings by senior officials to some of the black agents that their
careers could be in jeopardy as a result of the class-action
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the agency, James Mackin, denied the
accusations, saying: ``We have not in any way engaged in any
retaliatory actions or practices and would never do so. We have a
zero tolerance policy for discrimination of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusations of retaliation underscored the heightened
tension at the Secret Service since May 3, when the black agents
filed a lawsuit on a broad array of personnel policies.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict comes at a particularly significant time for the
Secret Service, with the presidential election in November opening
a number of leadership jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which is well known for its high-profile duties
protecting the president and other dignitaries, is one whose
internal operations are largely hidden by a secretive culture.
</P>
<P>
   Several agents said they had been subjected to direct and veiled
threats because they agreed to be identified as plaintiffs in the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Hendrix, a plaintiff who is on Vice President Al Gore's
security detail, said he was denied a promotion after complaining
that a superior told him of a racial quota system. Later, Hendrix
was transferred to what the lawyers said was a less desirable job.
</P>
<P>
   Another agent, Luther K. Ivery, said his superiors warned him
that they were displeased that he had joined the suit. In a legal
brief filed Thursday, Ivery quoted his supervisor as telling him,
``If I were you, I wouldn't be the one up front.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said the director of the Secret Service, Brian
Stafford, and another high-ranking official had written e-mail
messages warning them against participating in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   An agencywide electronic message on Feb. 25 to all employees
that was attributed to Stafford said that ``it is offensive for
anyone to question our commitment to equal employment opportunities
for all our employees,'' which the lawyers said was intended to
question the validity of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the agency would comment on the record about the
lawyers' accusation, but other Secret Service officials said the
message, distributed more than a month before the discrimination
complaint was filed, was meant only as a restatement of the
agency's official policies against racial discrimination and was
not intended to pass judgment on the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also asked a judge to halt job performance
evaluations that are scheduled to begin this month. The evaluations
are used to determine which agents will receive promotions.

MARKETERS BET ON THE CONCEPT OF GOOD LUCK AS A SELLING TOOL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Minn.)  By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who knew when Barbra Streisand asked the musical
question ``How Lucky Can You Get?'' that Madison Avenue would
provide this answer: You ain't seen nothing yet.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers and media magnates are celebrating the concept of
good fortune with a lengthening list of products, publications and
pitches centered on the word ``lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a magazine named Lucky is being introduced
nationally by Conde Nast Publications. A cool character called Mr.
Lucky is the focus of a quirky series of television, print and
poster ads for the Excite Web site. And the venerable Lucky Strike
cigarette brand is being reintroduced with a big advertising and
promotional push that plays up the iconic Lucky name.
</P>
<P>
   Those newcomers join users of luck as a sales tool like Lucky
Charms cereal; Lucky Dog, a long-distance telephone service
operated by AT&AMP;T; Lucky jeans; the Lucky chain of supermarkets; and
games with ``lucky'' in their names sold by various state
lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   Why are Lady Luck and Dame Fortune becoming almost as popular
with marketers as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera are with
teen-age music fans?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the state of the U.S. right now,'' said Jeff Weiss,
creative director at Amster Yard in New York, part of the
McCann-Erickson unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies that is
bringing out the Excite campaign for the At Home Corp. ``People are
feeling good.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the advertising has to be about using technology to make
us more human,'' he added. ``People like things that are warm, and
the whole air of `lucky' is warmth.''
</P>
<P>
   John Allen, senior partner at Lippincott &AMP; Margulies in New
York, a corporate identity consulting company owned by Marsh &AMP;
McLennan, echoed Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something warm and approachable about words with old
roots like `lucky,''' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what `lucky' is, and it's good,'' he added. ``It's
something people want.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy helped guide Conde Nast, part of Advance
Publications, in picking Lucky as the moniker for its magazine,
covering shopping for young women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's that moment when you find something on the racks and
it's beautiful, but you wonder whether it will pay out in the
dressing room,'' said Kim France, editor in chief at Lucky in New
York. ``When it does, you feel you got lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Lucky' feels inclusive and happy,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, ``Be happy, go Lucky'' was a slogan for Lucky
Strike, which flourished in that pre-filter era. The brand faltered
badly after the '50s, despite adding filtered and light styles to
its nonfiltered offerings. But British American Tobacco, which
acquired the U.S. rights to Lucky Strike in 1995, believes a
revival is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working to regenerate a fantastic trademark with a great
pedigree and heritage and authenticity that new brands don't
have,'' said Susan Ivey, senior vice president for marketing at the
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. in Louisville, Ky., the U.S. unit
of British American Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, she added, is to create perceptions of Lucky Strike as
``a free-spirited brand with a sense of humor'' by concentrating on
``the name, the package design, the slogans like `It's toasted' and
`LSMFT.'''
</P>
<P>
   The latter slogan _ which stands for ``Lucky Strike means fine
tobacco' _ is the subject of ads by the brand's agency, Bates USA
in New York, part of the Bates Worldwide unit of the Cordiant
Communications Group. One print ad carries the headline ``We
wouldn't say it if we didn't mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson is also sponsoring a contest with the
``LSMFT'' theme, which will award what is being billed as ``a dream
prize beginning with the letters `F' and `T.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for the word beginning with the letter ``L,'' it is ``very
optimistic,'' said Liv &UR;  &LR; Lane, a spokeswoman for General Mills &UR;  &LR; in
Minneapolis, which sells Lucky Charms. ``So it's no surprise it's
becoming more popular these days.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to keep up with the lucky come latelies, General Mills
periodically changes the shapes and colors of the Lucky Charms
``marbits,'' a company term for the marshmallow bits mixed in with
the cereal. The newest one is ``sparkling rainbows,'' Lane said,
which ``for a limited time have replaced the regular rainbow
marbits.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of ``lucky'' as a good luck charm predates Lucky
Charms, which was introduced in 1964. There was a 1943 film, `` Mr.
Lucky,'' starring Cary Grant as a suave gambler, which inspired a
television series of the same name, sponsored by Lever Brothers,
that ran on CBS during the 1959-60 season. Coincidentally, Lever
sold a Good Luck brand of margarine from 1948 into the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Does luckocentric marketing always work?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a saying that you can't just be good, you have to also
be lucky,'' said Marian Salzman, director at the Brand Futures
Group in New York, a trend-watching unit of Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, you can do all the work and preparing and
obsessing,'' she added, ``but without a stroke of luck you won't
get there.''

   THE STATES
</P>
<P>
   WON'T PLEDGE
</P>
<P>
   Might the days of The Pledge in tax-hating New Hampshire be
over? For years, candidates seeking election there have pledged to
block any new broad-based taxes. In her last two campaigns, Gov.
Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, took the pledge and stood by it. Now,
seeking a third term, she says she will not renew her vow. ``This
year I cannot make that same promise, whatever the political
price,'' the governor said this week. Declining to take the pledge
has hurt more than one New Hampshire political hopeful over the
years, but the state now faces a crisis: A court has ordered
officials to find a fairer way to finance education, one less
dependent on local property taxes. Four Republicans, a Democrat and
an independent are expected to try to unseat Shaheen, with at least
three of them campaigning for an income tax to pay for schools.
``New times demand new thinking,'' the governor said. ``I will not
arbitrarily rule out any potential solution to the challenge we
face.''

<P>
   GENDER BREAKTHROUGH
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, which has never elected a woman to any statewide
office higher than secretary of state, is poised for something like
a breakthrough this year. Two women are the major parties' nominees
for the post of lieutenant governor, and women, including a
third-party candidate for governor, will also be on the November
ballot in four other statewide races. The two nominees for the
state's second-highest office are both state senators: Betsy L.
Cochrane, a Republican, was the first woman to hold a leadership
position in the General Assembly, and Beverly M. Perdue, a
Democrat, has been co-chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee since 1993.

<P>
   THE REFORM PARTY
</P>
<P>
   NO REFORM LINE IN TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party traces its founding to the political dreams of
the Texas billionaire Ross Perot. But the party will not be on the
Texas ballot in November. A member of its national committee from
Texas, Kelly Abt, said this week that under pressure from
Democratic and Republican leaders, the state had set ballot
qualification hurdles so high that Pat Buchanan, the party's likely
presidential nominee, had been forced to run there as an
independent. But the Reform state chairman, Larry Steele, blamed
Buchanan, saying he could have helped get a Reform line on the
ballot had he put up the money and effort to gather the necessary
ballot-petition signatures. Buchanan, who has squabbled with state
Reform leaders around the country (they consider him a hard-right
zealot, not a reformer), says he decided to run as an independent
because he was not confident of the signature-gathering ability of
the Texas Reform Party.

PROPOSED ROAD-BUILDING BAN WOULD AFFECT MARK TWAIN NATIONAL
FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRAHAM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROLLA, Mo. _ A road-building ban proposed by President Clinton
for federal forests could draw more public attention to how small,
roadless woodlands are managed within the Mark Twain National
Forest in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Loggers want roads to cut valuable timber, but some
environmental groups say those roads disturb plants and wildlife
and should be limited in public forests. Recreational users want to
ensure that existing trails and roads are kept intact and perhaps
expanded for all-terrain vehicles, horseback riding and hunting
access.
</P>
<P>
   They will begin making their respective cases regarding
Clinton's proposal at public meetings from 7 to 10 p.m. today and
from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday at the University of Missouri-Rolla.
Foresters will talk about the proposal and answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an access issue,'' said Kevin Elliott, Mark Twain's
deputy forest supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The Mark Twain National Forest is a fragmented collection of
federal lands in southwest, central and southeast Missouri totaling
1.5 million acres. Most tracts already have roads, and officials
don't expect the Clinton proposal, if enacted, to cause major
changes in forest management.
</P>
<P>
   Yet three Mark Twain tracts with a combined 14,400 acres would
be protected from road building by the rule change. The Forest
Service has no immediate plans for timber sales in those areas, but
long-range log harvesting could be affected. The proposal doesn't
prohibit logging, just road building, but without roads timber
harvest would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would prohibit road building or reconstruction in
those three tracts automatically in the Mark Twain's long range
management plan.
</P>
<P>
   But road building in smaller roadless areas would be open to
public debate.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal dictates that management for roadless areas less
than 5,000 acres shall be addressed when a national forest's
long-term management plan is revised, Elliott said. Much of the
Mark Twain forest falls within that category, and its plan is
slated to be revised next year.
</P>
<P>
   So for Missouri, roads across smaller tracts will be the most
contentious issue, as decisions will be made at the local level
with public input.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have a spring and want to protect natural values around
it, and it's 20 acres, or we may have a 500-acre area we want to
protect,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is not designed to close existing trails and
commonly used roads. But forest officials expect those concerns to
surface, plus opposition from those who want more access and
commercial uses in forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically opposed to the designation of roadless areas
and anything that limits access to the forests,'' said Cory
Ridenhour, executive director of the Missouri Forest Products
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting timber harvest is wasteful forest management and leaves
older woodlands susceptible to disease and fire, Ridenhour said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Sierra Club's Missouri chapter favors the ban, said
Ken Midkiff, executive director. The group wants to halt illegal
use of old logging roads not designated as official roads on maps.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers will receive comments taken from the public at a
meeting in Rolla on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often you can't make both sides happy,'' said Charlotte
Wiggins, a spokeswoman for the Forest Service. ``But the emphasis
we have is having both sides at the table and hopefully they'll
listen to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal could be implemented by next year unless it
is derailed by congressional delays or court challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 43 million acres affected nationally are large
tracts in the West and they are the proposal's key target. In
addition the policy would defer a decision on logging in the
Tongass National Forest in Alaska for five years.

A STRONG ECONOMY IS VITAL FOR CLEAN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Supreme Court agreed this week to expand its review of
the Clean Air Act beyond strictly environmental concerns, some
environmentalists reacted as if their cause is something apart from
economic life.
</P>
<P>
   What the high court decided was to further scrutinize the
statute to determine whether it requires the government to consider
the costs as well as the public health benefits of lowering
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   One activist expressed a sense of betrayal, saying the law's
``bedrock principle'' was focusing exclusively on how air pollution
``affects the health of our children and the elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this view is how it ignores the fact that no
society can achieve what's best for its members unless that society
has the economic wherewithal to pay for such public goods as
cleaner air or anything that might enhance living conditions. The
resources necessary to finance these public goods can be gained
only from a strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   Children need parents with jobs, and jobs themselves when they
grow up. The elderly, moreover, need economic support provided by
the taxes that workers generate. Therefore, in the case of this
particular issue, any quest ignoring the need to balance
environmental interests with economic interests is doomed to be
less successful than otherwise would be the case. Without putting
too fine a point on it, it's irrational for environmental activists
to pretend economic considerations aren't critical to bettering the
quality of America's environment.
</P>
<P>
   At least half of all Americans aren't old enough to remember
that the environmental movement began to translate its goals into
realities only after the U.S. economy created the prosperity needed
to finance the job. The task of winning World War II and
transforming the economy from a war machine to a consumer
juggernaut left little time or money to worry about pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial cities were often smoky, smog-shrouded hellholes. A
form of gallows humor in such urban areas was the residents' claim
that the only air you could trust to breathe was ``air you could
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious environmental cleanup began only after a quarter-century
of postwar prosperity began to throw off enough extra wealth to
finance environmental improvements that were up to then considered
luxuries rather than necessities.
</P>
<P>
   If the court does decide that economic considerations should
play a part in pollution-law compliance considerations, it also
will be a healthy development in curbing regulatory autocracy.
Common-sense restraint has never been much of a consideration when
it comes to environmental regulatory matters. Congress made the
potential for government abuse much greater over the years by
passing legislation that left it up to the regulators to fill in
the blanks when it came to the details of standards and
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   If some sort of cost-benefit analysis is mandated by the court
to curb the penchant for overzealousness by regulators and their
environmentalist allies, prospects for the long-term success of
environmental improvement will be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   It's as simple as shortstopping tendencies to weaken the economy
in the name of improving the environment, because economic success
is needed to finance environmental goals.

CANADIAN ALUMINUM MAKER TO BUY SWISS RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Alcan Aluminium of Canada reached an agreement Thursday
to buy Algroup of Switzerland, after an influential Swiss
shareholder group threw its support behind a sweetened deal worth
$4.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Alcan had announced in April that it intended to bid for
Algroup, formerly known as Alusuisse Lonza, after European
regulators scuttled a more ambitious three-way deal that would also
have included Pechiney of France.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough for Alcan came after the BZ Group, controlled
by the Swiss investor Martin Ebner, said it would tender to Alcan
shares it controls amounting to 34 percent of Algroup.
</P>
<P>
   The BZ Group made that decision after Alcan agreed to reduce the
amount it would pay with its own shares and added cash to the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Alcan said it would exchange 17.1 of its common shares, plus a
cash payment and special cash dividend totaling 225 Swiss francs,
or about $133, for every Algroup share. That amounts to a 5 percent
increase on what Alcan had originally offered under the three-way
deal, an Algroup official said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to unite Alcan, Algroup and Pechiney failed after
European Union regulators objected to the dominant position that
the combined companies would have held in Europe, and Alcan refused
to compromise by divesting itself of European factories.
</P>
<P>
   The BZ Group's support makes it likely that the agreement, which
requires 67 percent of Algroup shares for approval, would succeed.
Approval is expected to be announced at a stockholder meeting in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Alcan and Algroup said their deal is expected to
bring annual cost savings before taxes of about $150 million. The
three-way combination, originally announced in August, had been
expected to generate savings of $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Based on 1999 results, the two-way combination would have annual
revenue of $12.4 billion, and would rank second in size to Alcoa of
the United States, the global market leader.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say Alcan and Algroup fit well, since Alcan specializes
in bulk aluminum and rolled aluminum sheets, while Algroup has
increasingly focused in recent years on aluminum parts for the
automobile industry, like engine blocks, and specialized aluminum
packaging for the food and drug industries.

PRUDENTIAL PONDERS STAKE IN JAPANESE INSURER
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Prudential Insurance Company of America, the largest
life insurer in the United States, has tentatively agreed to take a
stake in the Kyoei Life Insurance Co., one of Japan's many
faltering life insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies announced Thursday afternoon that they had
signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at giving Prudential
roughly a 20 percent stake in Kyoei, while the Japanese insurer
will receive a cash infusion of up to 30 billion yen, or about $277
million at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is effectively a rescue package for Kyoei. Its ability
to meet obligations and cover losses was rated among the lowest of
Japan's life insurers as of November. At that time, there was a 70
billion yen gap between what Kyoei had promised to pay
policyholders and returns it received on investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kyoei started having financial difficulties and came to us to
see if we could help them,'' said Kiyo Sakaguchi, executive vice
president of Prudential and head of its Japanese operations.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's life insurance companies are all struggling, burdened by
policies sold during the economic boom years that promised a high
rate of return. With the economy mired in weakness for much of the
last decade and interest rates at record lows, they cannot now make
enough on their investments to cover those obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, three Japanese life insurers have
failed, and foreign companies have bought four others. On
Wednesday, Japan's regulators forced Daihyaku Mutual, Japan's
15th-largest life insurer, to quit the life insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   But while Prudential is acting as a white knight, its stake in
Kyoei will not entitle it to a management role. ``Our objective is
not to take over Kyoei but to help them with financial support and
technical support,'' Sakaguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential would become Kyoei's largest shareholder, however,
and as such, might even play a role in the nascent movement here to
increase the awareness and influence of shareholders in corporate
Japan. ``I do see that trend developing, but it may take a little
while before shareholders here really assert their position,''
Sakaguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will also form a marketing joint venture to
sell a combination of their insurance policies as well as other
investment products. Prudential's sales and training model will be
used in hopes of making the sales force more professional.
Traditionally, selling life insurance has been a part-time job for
housewives in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential will also lend an investment expert to Kyoei to help
the Japanese insurer find strategies to improve its return on
investments.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said they hoped to cut costs and increase
efficiency by eliminating redundant operations.

BOSS'S TRIP INTO TRENCHES BRINGS CHANGE AT JOHN KNOX VILLAGE
CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEE'S SUMMIT, Mo. _ Fifteen months ago, Dan Rexroth stepped away
from his executive desk at John Knox Village. For a month, he, the
boss, became a front-line certified nursing assistant at John Knox
Village's skilled nursing facility.
</P>
<P>
   He changed diapers, sheets and bedpans, took blood pressure
readings and fed bedfast patients. He commiserated with entry-level
workers about physical and emotional demands. And he saw how
managers get so busy managing that they lose touch with their
employees and their customers, clients or patients.
</P>
<P>
   Rexroth vowed to make changes. The Kansas City Star, which wrote
about his down-in-the-trenches interlude in March 1999, revisited
him last week to find out what happened since.
</P>
<P>
   His initial account elicited reaction from all over the country.
Countless front-line workers said they wished their bosses walked
in their shoes for a while, too. Would it make a difference if they
did?
</P>
<P>
   Here's the legacy of one executive's experience in an
entry-level $8-an-hour job.
</P>
<P>
   Then: Rexroth said he wanted to continue making occasional
nursing assistant rounds to keep his patient-care skills sharp and
stay in touch with the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Since then: He tried to do at least one nursing assistant shift
a month in 1999 but hasn't done one at all in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only managed to go out and pass out meal trays now and
then. It's something I feel bad about,'' he said. ``I'm committed
to do it, but it just seems like I have more than a full-time job
as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Then: ``This experience has made me committed to getting the
entire staff at all levels involved in resident care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then: Rexroth realized that ordering his managers to pull
temporary job changes or extra shifts would not be an effective
motivator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to lead by example, and I think that happened,''
he said. ``A lot of the management staff has begun to voluntarily
help out at meal times.''
</P>
<P>
   One midlevel manager convenes a group of front-line employees
monthly to discuss ways to improve residents' quality of life. One
suggestion was to install heat lamps in the bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bingo. We did that _ a great example of listening to the front
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Then: Rexroth felt back strain and other physical stresses from
lifting and moving adult patients. He pledged to buy more lifting
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Since then: The staff helped research, test and select several
new kinds of lifting devices. The health center also beefed up its
lifting training program.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Missouri Division of Aging is giving the Village
Care Center a best-practices award for its lifting program, ``and
we've had our best year ever with our lowest workers' compensation
and injury claims total on record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some pieces of lifting equipment cost between $5,000 and
$10,000. A fund-raising auxiliary and some budget allocations have
bought two-thirds of the equipment he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this would have happened without me seeing the need
firsthand,'' he mused, ``but an impassioned spokesperson makes a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Then: Rexroth saw how difficult it was for nursing assistants to
be constantly reassigned to different patients, different units or
different shifts. At the same time, he saw a demand for more
flexible and part-time shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Since then: ``We haven't fully succeeded in that task, but we're
trying not to move people around as much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Staffing reassignments are necessary when people call in sick or
when people quit the high-turnover jobs. (Turnover a year ago and
now hovers around 50 percent.) The care center is a 24-hour-a-day,
seven-day-a-week operation, and that requires a lot of staff
juggling.
</P>
<P>
   To help minimize unwanted schedule disruptions, he created
part-time, evening ``floater'' positions for nursing assistants who
are paid a premium ($12 to $15 an hour) to fill in wherever needed.
The new positions are ``immensely popular,'' Rexroth said.
</P>
<P>
   Then: Rexroth saw how transportation problems and family needs
sometimes made it difficult or impossible for staffers to get to
work at odd hours in Lee's Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Since then: He's advertising two new staff positions that will
be part-time, management-level jobs with an unusual duty: support
and solve problems for the front-line staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so focused on taking care of our patients that we lose
sight of taking care of our associates, our people who do the
work,'' Rexroth said.
</P>
<P>
   The new managers will be part social worker, part job counselor
and part human relations expert, Rexroth said. ``They will need to
be good communicators who can both relate to the front line and
promote the John Knox philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then: Rexroth worried that the $8-an-hour starting pay for
nursing assistants was not a livable wage and couldn't attract
good-quality workers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then: John Knox Village top managers took no raises this
year, and channeled the money to staff raises. All employees ``were
moved up a bit'' in pay, he said, but starting wages haven't jumped
appreciably. He remains concerned about that.
</P>
<P>
   Then: Rexroth saw that the nursing assistant job constantly
pulled workers in several directions and that it was hard to
prioritize duties.
</P>
<P>
   Since then: The care center added part-time, minimum-wage
positions for area high school students and John Knox Village
residents to help at meal time and provide other non-nursing care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do things like give water, make beds, straighten up
rooms, deliver flowers, pass meal trays,'' Rexroth said. ``It's an
immense help.''
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of John Knox Village residents took policy changes.
Previously, that was forbidden. But, Rexroth said, it's a good
match for the residents and care center.
</P>
<P>
   There's no official scorecard for changes made since Rexroth's
job-swap experience. He admits that some of the changes may have
occurred without his input. Some can be credited to others' ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But, in his own words, an ``impassioned spokesperson'' helped.

SOLIS AVOIDING ARGUMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alex Solis is taking the high road in the argument over Red
Bullet's loss to Fusaichi Pegasus at the Wood Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   That's the only way to go to avoid a collision with Joe Orseno,
Red Bullet's trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Orseno blamed Solis for Red Bullet's second-place finish at New
York's Aqueduct racetrack, contending the jockey tired the
then-undefeated colt by placing him too close to the pace. After
Jerry Bailey rode Red Bullet to an upset victory over Fusaichi
Pegasus in the Preakness Stakes, an emboldened Orseno kept saying
the Wood defeat was Solis' fault.
</P>
<P>
   Solis needn't worry about criticism from Orseno blemishing his
reputation. The California-based Solis, 36, probably has won more
major races than the New York-based Orseno, 44, has entered.
</P>
<P>
   But Solis deserved to defend himself. He began Thursday by
indicating he didn't want a war of words.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sees it one way, I see it another way. I have to respect
his opinion,'' Solis said during the Hollywood Park races. ``You
know me real good _ I'm never going to put anybody down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panama-born jockey pointed out that before he rode Red
Bullet for the first time in the 1-mile Gotham Stakes March 19 at
Aqueduct, the son of Unbridled had been slow out of the gate in
both of his starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I rode him in the Gotham, he (Orseno) asked me to put him
in the race (early),'' Solis said. He followed instructions _
although Red Bullet was in midpack early in the Gotham, he was
never more than two lengths off the lead before surging to victory
on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet figured to run closer to the pace in the Wood on
April 15. It was a 1-mile race, so the pace would be slower. Also,
in the interim, Orseno had given the colt a pair of
fastest-of-the-morning workouts at Belmont Park, a training
maneuver that's bound to inject early speed.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet broke sharply in the Wood and was lapped on front-
runner Country Only through quarter-miles run in 23 1/5 seconds, 46
4/5 and 1:10 2/5. Fusaichi Pegasus and jockey Kent Desormeaux ran
them all down in the stretch and won by 4 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little keen to go on,'' Solis said of the early going
in the Wood. ``At the moment I had to make a decision, and being
down inside (near the rail) at the time, I decided to stay where I
was. I wound up being second without ever using him. . . . I never
pushed him out of the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Solis wasn't going to second-guess himself as Orseno did and
keeps doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go into a race with a good plan,'' Solis said. ``When things
don't come out like you want, you don't have days to make a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   One observer who defends Solis is Bobby Frankel, trainer of
Aptitude, who finished a fast-closing third in the Wood, ridden
then by Brice Blanc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse (Red Bullet) was coming off a sharp mile race, there
wasn't much pace in the (Wood), and horses were winning on the lead
that day,'' Frankel said Thursday on a conference call with turf
writers. ``Personally, I just thought he got outrun that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel obviously has confidence in Solis.
</P>
<P>
   After riding Aptitude to second place behind Fusaichi Pegasus in
the Kentucky Derby, Solis will be aboard Frankel's colt again in
the Belmont Stakes a week from Saturday. A victory would end a
frustrating stretch for Solis in Triple Crown races _ since winning
the 1986 Preakness with Snow Chief, Solis has gone 0 for 13 in the
3-year-old classics, including seconds with Captain Bodgit (1997),
Victory Gallop (1998) and Aptitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's maturing, he's a horse that's really improving,''
Solis said of Aptitude. ``That's one of the things I liked about
him when he went to the Derby. . . . I strongly believe Aptitude is
a better horse going a mile and a half than any of these horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, although Fusaichi Pegasus might run in the 1-mile
Belmont, Red Bullet has been withdrawn from the race, so Solis
won't have a shot at thorough vindication.
</P>
<P>
   Orseno announced last weekend that he and owner Frank Stronach
decided to save Red Bullet for big races in the future _ the Aug. 6
Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park, the Aug. 26 Travers Stakes
at Saratoga and the Nov. 4 Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill
Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to squeeze the lemon dry,'' the trainer said,
borrowing an old line. ``We want to race him as a 4-year-old, and
if you run in a mile-and-a-half race, that knocks you out for three
months. It's pointless.''
</P>
<P>
   But passing up the Belmont _ and a possible rubber match with
Fusaichi Pegasus _ casts Red Bullet and his trainer as villains
rather than heroes of this Triple Crown season. It was one thing to
be a ``fresh horse'' going into the Preakness after skipping the
Derby. It's something else to be a ``fresh horse'' coming out of
the Preakness by skipping the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   If your horse runs in only one of the three classics, while
Fusaichi Pegasus withstands the rigors of two or all three, then
you're faced with a couple of possibilities: You have an inferior
horse or you did an inferior training job.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Orseno has claimed instead that Red Bullet would be 2 for 2
against Fusaichi Pegasus if not for Alex Solis. The trainer had an
obligation to run his colt in the Belmont and back up his words.

FOURTH GRADE TEST SCORES RISE SUBSTANTIALLY ACROSS NEW YORK STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fourth graders throughout New York state performed
remarkably better this year in the second year of a more rigorous
reading and writing test, with 59 percent passing compared with 48
percent in 1999, education officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even in New York City, which has long lagged considerably behind
suburban and upstate school districts, 42 percent of fourth graders
passed the test, up from only 33 percent last year. All of the
city's 32 community school districts noted improvement on the test,
which was introduced last year to help prepare students for new
state graduation requirements being phased in over the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, said the
results bolstered his high-profile effort to toughen standards
throughout the state's schools and to hold students accountable
through more demanding standardized tests. But Mills and other
educators acknowledged that the failure rate was still disturbingly
high, with 41 percent of the state's fourth graders still not
reading and writing at grade level.
</P>
<P>
   ``One significant increase is not nearly enough,'' Mills said in
an interview. ``Everything depends on follow-through over a long
period of time.'' Others cautioned against reading too much into
the improved scores, pointing out that this was only the second
year of the new test. It is not unusual for scores to be strikingly
low in the first year a test is given, then rise in the second year
as students and teachers grow more comfortable with the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always advisable to look at long-term trends and not get
too excited about short-term changes,'' said Robert Berne, vice
president for academic affairs at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's results horrified parents and teachers not only in
New York City, but in many wealthy suburban schools whose students
had always scored exceptionally well. Those districts showed the
same substantial improvement as New York City this year. In
Westchester County, 73.1 percent of students passed this year,
compared with 61 percent in 1999. In Nassau County, the percentage
of passing students jumped to 77 percent from 65 percent. And 71
percent of Suffolk County's fourth graders passed this year's test,
compared with 58 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, one less-than-optimistic note. The sharpest
increases in New York City, which aggregated data by race, were
among white and Asian students, who make up only 16 percent and 11
percent, respectively, of the city's 1.1 million schoolchildren.
The scores of black and Hispanic students in New York City improved
less significantly, with only about 6 percent achieving the highest
level of proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Education officials shed little light on why the fourth graders
fared so much better this year, saying only that students were
spending more time reading and writing, and that teachers were
finally devising methods that work. In addition, principals have
been ``studying data like crazy'' and determining effective
strategies for helping slow learners, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Mills and Harold O. Levy, the New York City schools chancellor,
acknowledged that schools were ``teaching to the test,'' but said
they were doing so only by requiring children to spend more time on
basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This test is not something you can drill for,'' Mills said in
an interview. ``There is nothing to memorize, unless you count
punctuation and grammar. The only way to prepare for these tests is
to read a lot and write a lot, and certainly there is a tremendous
amount of that going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But other educators said that teachers were spending more time
having their students read short passages for comprehension and
answering questions about them. Those drills, the educators said,
were taking time away from reading full books in some schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can drill kids in reading and writing in ways that don't
develop their literacy skills as much as they should,'' said Norman
Fruchter, director of the Institute for Education and Social Policy
at New York University. ``The more they focus on quick
comprehension of short passages, the more the notion of narrative
and context gets lost.'

HULL SHOOTS, AND TIES SERIES WITH DEVILS
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Brett Hull
scored the goal that won the Stanley Cup for Dallas last season and
he leads the tournament this season with 11. A veteran who has
proved he is more than just a shooting star, Hull retains the
finishing touch to break open a game _ and close one, too.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He scored on the Stars' first shot Thursday night in the first
period against the Devils and he scored on their last shot with 3
minutes 16 seconds remaining. They were enough to give the Stars a
2-1 victory and a 1-1 tie in the best-of-7 Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hull is probably the best pure shooter in the league,'' said
Devils coach Larry Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' goal was scored by Alexander Mogilny.
</P>
<P>
   Games 3 and 4 will be played in Dallas, on Saturday and Monday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's winning goal came on a play that formed on the left-wing
side. Mike Modano pushed the puck past Brian Rafalski on the
Devils' defense. Jere Lehtinen shot it toward Martin Brodeur in the
Devils' net, and Hull, forcing himself ahead of Scott Stevens,
re-directed the path of the puck. It was only the 17th shot against
Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he thought the play was offside.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said Hull has changed his style on
the ice from his freewheeling youth because scores are lower and
checking is tighter in recent seasons. Hull is more patient in
waiting for his opportunities and willing to implement other
aspects of the game besides shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big win for this team.'' Hitchcock said. ``This is a
huge win. We've got our building and our fans, where we get pretty
wrapped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Belfour stopped 27 of 28 Devils shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had only one shot on Brodeur in the first 13 minutes
of the game. And it was not a dangerous looking shot. It was just a
routine push from the left-wing circle from Hull, who took a pass
from Modano after a Devils turnover along the wall. But Hull's shot
eluded Brodeur on the glove side at 4:25, giving Hull the playoffs
lead in goals with 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils tied it at 1-1 at 12:42 on a goal by Alexander
Mogilny, who beat Belfour on the glove side with a wrist shot after
Scott Gomez set him up. Gomez carried the puck through the neutral
zone and drew three Stars toward him. As they converged, Gomez
kicked the puck ahead with his skate to his stick and then found
his linemate cutting free into the Dallas zone.
</P>
<P>
   There were several incidents of rough play, and a few included
Claude Lemieux, the aggressive right wing of the Devils. In
addition to a holding penalty at 8:20, Lemieux got away with a head
butt against Jon Sim and with removing the helmet of Hull in a
scrum after a whistle.
</P>
<P>
   The second period saw tight checking by both teams. Patrik Elias
and Petr Sykora, the hot wings of the Devils, occasionally forced
themselves free for odd-man rushes. But even those were quickly
stifled by either Belfour or the Dallas backcheckers. Players for
both sides were rigorous about their positioning and careful about
any gambles so that every mistake _ and there were not many _
seemed to stand out.
</P>
<P>
   Derian Hatcher, the Dallas captain and defenseman, said: ``It
was almost like a chess match. It's been a long time since we've
played a game that strategic on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Hitchcock discussed how he expected his team
to respond after losing by 7-3 in the series opener here on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing like we did really boils down to a pride factor within
our group,'' Hitchcock said. ``We can't control how New Jersey
plays, but we sure as heck can control how we play. We have got an
awful lot of pride in this organization. We got slapped pretty hard
and we need to respond in the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said Game 1 would not be indicative of the entire
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are always surprised to score seven goals against a team
like Dallas,'' Robinson said. ``They pride themselves in being a
great defensive team. What you do is you wash away Game 1. I look
at this as a seven-game series. Each game is a series in itself and
so once the game is over with, let's forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the league has tried to tighten up its schedule to get
the playoffs finished earlier, they could go as late as June 12
this time. Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the NHL, has said he
hopes to end next year's tournament when the date of the month is
still in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm and humid day, Robinson was asked about the length of
a season that begins with training camp in early September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was long when we were playing in May,'' he said,
recalling his career as a defenseman with Montreal. ``So, it is
definitely not the way I think that most people would like it. I
know from speaking to a lot of fans that they say that they find it
hard sometimes watching games when it is in the middle of June. But
there is no way getting around it. It's a long season, long
playoffs. The nice thing about it is when you are playing in June,
it means you have gone a long way.''

   NEW YORK _ After a wait of 55 years, the extra seconds it took
for New York Gov. George Pataki to fumble with the medals and pin
them to Haywood Campbell's suit coat Thursday did not faze the old
soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a dark suit coat with brass buttons, with a baseball
cap perched on his head, Campbell, an 82-year-old veteran of World
War II, stood in the central room of the Harlem Armory on Fifth
Avenue with the help of a metal cane, holding his chin up and
forward in a military pose.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was small. Yet, for Campbell and a fellow veteran,
Oscar Osborne Jr., 77, it was significant. They each received the
Bronze Star, a military honor they earned during the Battle of the
Bulge in 1945 but were denied because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   They also received the New York State Conspicuous Service Cross,
and Campbell was awarded the New York State Conspicuous Service
Star.
</P>
<P>
   The overdue decorations came after decades during which history
seemed to have been erased. ``We was fighting right along with the
white buddies,'' said Campbell, a staff sergeant. ``We died
together.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the war, the survivors did not bask in the
glory together. Instead, blacks who had volunteered to fight
shoulder to shoulder with whites found that their discharge papers
did not reflect their combat service, instead listing them as
members of units that unloaded supplies or dug graves.
</P>
<P>
   Black soldiers, normally restricted to labor battalions, had
been asked by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower to fight after U.S. troops
suffered 75,000 casualties in the Battle of the Bulge. Five
thousand signed up to join the intense fighting at the front. Many
of the 2,221 who were selected had to give up their ranks and fight
as privates.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne was shot in the arm and, after months in the hospital,
discharged. Campbell stayed on the front until the end of the war.
On one day, he said, his squad captured 22 German troops.
</P>
<P>
   Both men said they were among the first in their companies to
volunteer, Osborne to defend American democracy and Campbell
because of his opposition to Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran attending the ceremony, Vincent Malveaux, said,
``If you're called to serve in an integrated army, maybe you'd
better answer the call, because this was what the people back home
were fighting for.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their valor, neither of the medal recipients relished
telling their children about the war days. ``There wasn't much joy
in talking about it,'' Osborne said.
</P>
<P>
   Although their service paved the way for President Truman's
integration of the armed forces in 1948, they and their comrades
suffered the indignity of what Pataki called a ``direct effort to
suppress'' the heroism of blacks in combat. Veterans at the
ceremony said they were unnoted by journalists, left out of
official accounts and denied access to their records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was upset that he came home as a private,'' said
Frances Cobell of her brother, Campbell. ``He was a sergeant.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, an announcement came that anyone who served in certain
units during the Battle of the Bulge qualified for the Bronze Star,
usually given on an individual basis. But the 2,221 Negro
Volunteers, as they have become known, did not receive them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, on the 50th anniversary of Truman's integration of the
armed forces, five volunteers received their medals at the
Pentagon.

LENEXA WOMAN SEES A NEED AND FILLS IT _ WITH CASTOFF CASINO
BRIDGES

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A 130-pound woman moved four 10-ton bridges
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Never underestimate what one person can do.
</P>
<P>
   It started four years ago, when Margie Burton of Lenexa was
riding her horse at the John Redmond Reservoir in Kansas and was
surprised to discover that the 16-mile trail ended at a steep creek
bed.
</P>
<P>
   There was no bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Burton jumped off her horse and tried to hike down the slope.
Two steps landed her in deep muck. Anyone using the reservoir's
trails must either slop through the creek beds, or hike to a busy
high-speed road, or ask permission from private property owners to
walk on their land.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a park ranger at the reservoir, about 110 miles
southwest of Kansas City, told Burton that more trails could be
opened with a bridge. But funds were too tight. The park needed a
donation.
</P>
<P>
   So Burton decided to go shopping _ for a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   What do you think you can do about this? You're just one person.
Leave it alone, a voice kept saying in her head.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, as she dropped her 81-year-old mother off to
gamble at the Argosy Casino in Riverside, she saw them: bridges.
Four of them, resting near the parking lot with weeds crawling up
their sides, their metal braces gleaming.
</P>
<P>
   The bridges were castoffs from the casino, used in its days of
floating up and down the river. Since 1996, the casino hadn't used
them. They were useless hunks of metal, rusting away.
</P>
<P>
   The bridges are big, 55 feet long; 8 feet, 8 inches tall; and 9
feet, 4 inches wide _ plenty wide for a horse and a rider.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, Burton thought. I never noticed them here before.
</P>
<P>
   First, she called Mike Cunningham, facility manager of the
Argosy Casino. He told her she could have the bridges, if she would
move them. Argosy charged Burton $10 for all four.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day at a truck stop, she spotted a semi-tractor
trailer with a long bed. Off she went to see Art Griffin, vice
president of Belger Cartage Service Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder to say no to somebody in person,'' she explained
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin agreed to charge a nominal fee to move the bridges, but
Burton would have to find a crane to hoist them onto the trucks.
</P>
<P>
   So Burton called BSC Steel of Kansas City with the same story,
same request. After estimating the bridges' weight, the company
donated the use of a crane and some operators.
</P>
<P>
   Then she called Gary Simmons, the park ranger at John Redmond
Reservoir, to tell him the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary, I found your bridges,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons didn't speak for several seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me aback when she told me,'' he said. ``I was thinking
in terms of several months down the road _ maybe _ not several
days. We've been needing these for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The bridges will give the reservoir an additional 14 miles of
continuous trails and make 1,500 more acres accessible. Simmons
expects the bridges to be in use by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them will be installed at the creeks that blocked Burton
and her horse before: East Hickory Creek and West Hickory Creek,
located on the east side of the dam. They'll put up the third at
the Riverside West recreational area, a campground just south of
the dam.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth bridge is going to Burlington, on the south edge of
the town where a hiking//biking trail is being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people will benefit from these bridges. Thousands of
hikers, mountain bikers, horseback riders, fishermen and hunters,''
Simmons said. ``...Margie is amazing. All you have to do is mention
what you need to her and she goes out and gets them.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons couldn't think of anything else the park needs now,
except for more visitors. Last year, 200,000 people used the park.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning at the Argosy Casino, the crane creaked and
groaned under the weight of the first bridge. As the crane lifted
the bridge on its side, then onto the flatbed truck, Burton danced
a jig, twirling and prancing, ending with a fit of giggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, look, look! This is just great! Amazing how they can
lift this heavy metal up like that,'' said Burton, 50, who is a
competitive endurance horseback rider. Last year, Burton and a
friend, Patti Crawford, 58, organized the American Royal Centennial
Trail Ride from St. Joseph to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, all the time I was asking people, I kept thinking,
`What can I do? I'm just one person,' '' Burton said. ``Well, this
is an example of a whole lot of one persons. This taught me if we
all do just a little bit we can accomplish great things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even one person.''

 PERSONALS: Inside Your Head and Counting the Minutes  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)

<TEXT>
<P>
   An AdOutlet.com survey in which 150 people were asked to keep
daily diaries of their thoughts for a week found that women think
twice as long as men per day about political issues (12 minutes to
6 minutes) and 25 times as long about their hair (75 minutes to 3
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Where men have women beaten is in thinking about themselves (men
five times as often as women) and about food (120 minutes per day
to 80 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Turning from what's in your head to what's on it, Elle
reports that the latest beauty products contain maple syrup, based
on the following logic: If trees can survive in cold weather, can't
the products of those trees help dry skin and hair? Next on the
horizon: Did you ever notice that rocks don't get wrinkles?

   _  &UR; Sting &LR;  told BBC radio that he has given up tantric sex and is

<P>
   _  &UR; Marlin Fitzwater &LR; , former press secretary to  &UR; Ronald Reagan &LR; 
and  &UR; George Bush &LR; , has sold a novel to Public Affairs Books. It's
based on a true story about an 18-year-old schoolteacher in Kansas
who was accused of having an affair with a 14-year-old student.

<P>
   _ Forty works of graphic art by San Francisco poet  &UR; Lawrence &LR; 
 &UR; Ferlinghetti &LR;  will be shown at the National Gallery of Prague next
month. Ferlinghetti told ARTnews that he likes Prague because ``The
people who were in jail under the dictatorship are now running the
cultural scene. They haven't had time to get disillusioned like the
French. It's like '68 just happened there.''

   _  &UR; Gerald Nachman &LR;  went to see the dance musical ``Contact'' at
Lincoln Center in New York and saw a sign at the front door saying,
``At this performance, there will be smoke effects, gunshots,
strobe lights, cigarette smoking and fishnet stockings.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In the audience at Sunday night's Negativland
multimedia/live/puppet show _ an anti-consumerism extravaganza _ in
Palo Alto, Calif., was San Francisco filmmaker  &UR; Craig Baldwin &LR; , who
creates films out of snippets of footage from other sources and is
part of the 2000 Whitney Biennial. Despite the don't-buy message,
T-shirts reading ``Copyright infringement is your best
entertainment value'' were sold in the lobby.

<P>
   _ Saxophonists die younger than musicians who specialize in any
other instrument, says a British Medical Journal finding reported
in Metrosource. Studying 813 jazz saxophonists born between 1882
and 1974, the researchers discovered that half died before they
were 40; half of other musicians hung on until at least 60.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers thought that ``circular breathing technique,''
in which a player inhales through the nose while blowing out
through the mouth might reduce blood flow to the heart and brain
and contribute to a high a player feels; it also might facilitate
strokes and heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Playing more than one instrument seemed to increase longevity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers at Ohio State University report that people with
high credit card balances have more health problems than those with
low balances. ``The higher your debt-to-income ratio,'' says a
Health magazine report on the research, ``the more your health is
apt to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Chukka Sachs &LR;  saw a Corvair with a Darwin fish sticker on it,
which she describes as a case of ``Unsafe at Any Speed'' meeting
``Survival of the Fittest.''

<P>
   _ The Berkeley Bark reports that  &UR; Sigmund Freud &LR;  had three dogs,
 &UR; Jofi &LR; ,  &UR; Lunyu &LR;  and  &UR; Wolf &LR; , and said he loved them because ``The
direct simplicity of their lives is free of the inner
contradictions of civilization that are so hard for us to deal
with.''
