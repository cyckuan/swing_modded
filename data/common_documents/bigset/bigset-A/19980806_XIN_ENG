<HEADLINE> Turkish Officers Expelled for Pro-Islamic Tendency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 24 officers have been
expelled from the Turkish Armed Forces for their inclination
toward Islamism, the Daily News newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Their discharge was in line with a decision made at the Supreme
Military Council (SMC) meeting, which started Monday.
</P>
<P>
These officers were allegedly involved in fundamental and other
illegal activities, informed sources, who asked not to be named,
were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's powerful military has always kept the armed forces
under tight control in order to prevent the infiltration of
Islamic thoughts.
</P>
<P>
Every year a different number of officers are discharged from
the army due to similar reasons, which sets off criticism by human
rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
The SMC meeting, which will end Thursday, is to decide on the
promotion of top military officers, including the post of chief of
general staff.

<HEADLINE> India Announces Measures to Boost Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government announced
Wednesday a special package of measures to revive sagging exports
by slashing interests on pre- and post-shipment credit and
allowing legal undertakings instead of bank guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the package in Lok Sabha, the lower house of
Parliament, Commerce Minister Ramakrishna Hegde said that special
temporary facility of reduction in pre- and post-shipment credit
to nine percent from 11 percent would be available for the whole
of the current financial year.
</P>
<P>
The package was worked out jointly by the ministries of
commerce and finance after a series of meetings which reviewed the
declining trends in exports in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Hegde said that effecting from September 1, this year, the
government would pay interest to exporters if duty drawback dues
or refund of terminal excise duty was delayed beyond two months.
</P>
<P>
The facility of legal undertakings instead of bank guarantees
at present given to customs as a security for import of duty-free
raw materials would be provided to manufacturer-exporters to
tackle the problem of procedural delays.
</P>
<P>
The commerce minister extended the tax holiday to export
oriented units and export processing zones from the present five
to 10 years, permitted subcontracting facility to export oriented
units in domestic tariff area and allowed export through couriers.
</P>
<P>
He also extended the benefit of export promotion capital goods
(EPCG) scheme to private software technology parks and said
specified technology and small scale engineering industry would be
entitled to zero-duty EPCG scheme under the 10 million rupee
threshold limit.
</P>
<P>
During the financial of 1997-98, India's exports were valued at
33.98 billion U.S. dollars while imports were valued at 40.779
billion U.S. dollars, indicating a trade deficit of 6.799 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted last month by the Confederation
of Indian Industry's Council, the first quarter of 1998-99
witnessed a negative growth rate in 93 industry sectors, including
automobile, steel, cement and capital goods.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry said India's exports have been hit by the
sluggishness in international trade and currency crisis in the
Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Due to sharp depreciation of the currencies of these countries,
said the annual report of the ministry for 1997-98 released in
July, not only has India's competitiveness vis-a-vis these
countries been affected but also direct exports from India to the
Southeast Asian region have suffered badly.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Herald daily, since the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) came to power in March, foreign institutional
investors have withdrawn 450 million U.S. dollars, foreign
exchange reserves have come down by 1.6 billion U.S. dollars and
exporters' orders have been canceled by several industrialized
countries.
</P>
<P>
This, the paper said, might lead to widening of trade deficit
to around 10 billion U.S. dollars this year and there is no chance
to achieve the planned target of 20 percent growth rate in
exports.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Wants Full Diplomatic Ties with Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has asked for upgrading
diplomatic relations with Egypt and reopening embassies in both
Cairo and Baghdad after seven years of icy ties, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Sherif Reehan, head of the Egyptian Interest Section in
Baghdad, told the Egyptian news agency from Baghdad Wednesday that
the request came at a recent meeting between him and Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Aziz lauded the improvement of bilateral
ties, and said the recent visits by Egyptian Trade Minister Ahmed
Goweili and Health Minister Ismail Sallam to Baghdad helped
promote trade relations, Reehan added.
</P>
<P>
Sallam visited Baghdad last month at the head of a 50-member
delegation and personally undertook three surgeries for Iraqi
cardiac patients.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi ministers of industry and health are expected to visit
Cairo in the coming few weeks, the Egyptian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-Baghdad relations were virtually cut off during the
1991 Gulf War when Egypt joined the U.S.-led multi-national forces
to drive Iraq out of Kuwait. However they have since tried to keep
their diplomatic ties at the level of councillorship.
</P>
<P>
Last year Iraq purchased from Egypt medicines, mostly
antibiotics, worth 14 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of 1998, Egyptian exports to Iraq
reached 203 million dollars, and are expected to top 250 million
dollars for the whole year. Most of the Egyptian exports are
pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs within the framework of the
oil-for-food program of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iraq-U.N. deal struck in 1996, Iraq is permitted to
sell a limited amount of oil every six months to import food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The program is an exception of the crippling economic sanctions
the U.N. Security Council imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
While some Egyptian firms inked deals with Baghdad to increase
food and medical exports, others have offered to participate in
schemes to develop Iraq's dilapidated oil sector and prospect for
new oil fields.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Females More Likely to Suffer AIDS: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Females are morely likely to be
infected with AIDS than males because of cultural as well as
social and economic reasons, an AIDS official told Xinhua here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Aknne Nakaweesi, an administration and advocacy coordinator
with Uganda AIDS Commission, said that of the 49,432 adult cases
recorded till December 1997, 26,104 were females, accounting for
54 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Jane Kanyunyuzi, a documentation and information coordinator
there, said in the age group 15-19 years, girls are six times
more likely to be infected than boys in the same age group.
</P>
<P>
They both agreed that there are many reasons for the result.
But cultural and socio-economic reasons are the major ones.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, male superiority is nationally observed. And there
are many girls of this age drop out of school to save fees for
their brothers because families cannot afford all the children's
school fees. These dropouts are very likely to take to
prostitution, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Young girls are deemed as safe and therefore they are often
victims of rapes and defilements.
</P>
<P>
Polygamy and inheritage of widows are also held partially
responsible for the spread of the pandemic. The number of wives
is an indicator of the husband's wealth and social status.
</P>
<P>
Widows are traditionally encouraged to remain in the families
by being inherited by her brothers-in-law. This is the best way
to guarantee her kids are better protected and their livelihood
is secured.
</P>
<P>
It is very difficult for the widow to remarry and have her
kids properly protected, they added. In that case, the kids would
suffer discrimination as a result.
</P>
<P>
The notion of family lineage, clan and tribe is stressed.
Although widows can choose to remarry, most of them usually
prefer to be inherited within the big family.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Delegation to Mediate Crisis in Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) is to send a delegation to Guinea Bissau
soon to meet with parties of the conflict in the
Portuguese-speaking country.
</P>
<P>
This was agreed on at a one-day meeting of representatives of
the ECOWAS Committee of Seven on Guinea Bissau Tuesday in Accra,
Ghana, according to a report reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting attended by foreign ministers of Burkina Faso,
Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea and ambassadors of Nigeria and
Senegal was trying to find a solution to the two-month-old
conflict in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Crisis broke out in Guinea Bissau in early June when dismissed
Chief of Army Staff, General Ansumane Mane led a rebellion
against President Joao Bernado Vieira.
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Seven was set up in July to mediate the
crisis. It has been mandated to use dialog and negotiations,
imposition of sanctions and enforcement of embargo, and use force
as a last resort to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after Tuesday's meeting, the Committee
reaffirmed its objectives in Guinea Bissau, including the
restoration of peace and restitution of the authority of
President Vieira.
</P>
<P>
The committee mentioned the on-going initiative by the
community of Portuguese-speaking countries and welcomed the truce
declared by troops loyal to Vieira and the rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
The committee said it was prepared to cooperate with the
community of Portuguese-speaking nations and expressed support for
other initiatives which might contribute to the realization of
ECOWAS objectives in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
It expressed appreciation to the United Nations and other
institutions providing humanitarian assistance to civilian
victims of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS committee reiterated that lasting peace could not
be achieved in Guinea Bissau unless initiatives to resolve the
crisis were undertaken within the context of efforts to safeguard
sub-regional security.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS has earlier rejected a request by Portugal that it
should steer clear of the crisis in Guinea Bissau, saying that if
the former colonial master wants to help, it should do so in
concert with the region where the country is located.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Reforest Lands Destroyed by Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece decided Wednesday to
reforest hundreds of thousands of acres of forestland destroyed by
raging fires in the past week.
</P>
<P>
Greek firefighters, backed by fireplanes and local residents,
have been battling forest fires which broke out around Athens on
Sunday, but it is difficult for them to put the fires under
control because of the strong winds. Meanwhile, forestry service
officials estimated that the latest wave of fires had destroyed
some 800,000 stremma of forest and bush.
</P>
<P>
Greek Environment, Town planning and Public Works Minister
Costas Laliotis said Wednesday that all areas burnt by fire would
automatically be designated for reforestations.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Agriculture Ministry would finance a massive project
for reforestation and the first step would be to secure the
denuded expanses with mesh to contain land erosion, said Minister
Stephanos Tzoumakas after meeting Prime Minister Costas Simitis,
who returned to Athens Tuesday from his vacation to discuss with
ministers the ways of tackling forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Tzoumakas said that expanses that had burnt for a second time
would undergo artificial reforestation while land burnt for the
first time would be reforested naturally.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Farmers' Earnings Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's commercial farmers
will earn 19 billion Zimbabwean Dollars (about 900 million U.S.
Dollars) from the sale of commodities in the current marketing
year, an increase of eight percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Wednesday at the Congress of Commercial
Farmers' Union (CFU) in Harare by CFU Deputy Director Jerry
Grant.
</P>
<P>
"Of the major commodities grown, good maize prices will almost
double earnings for maize growers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commodities which had done well were paprika and horticulture
which produced more than 60 different types of fruits and
vegetables and a wide range of cut flowers, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Grant said, this year's production was below that of
1996 in real terms due to poor tobacco prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, John Smith, chairman of the Poultry Producers'
Association, said poultry meat production in the formal sector
remained at last year's level while egg production slightly rose.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe would not develop a highly competitive poultry
industry unless it produced sufficient maize, Smith noted.
</P>
<P>
"Given sufficient maize at realistic price, we should become
the dominant poultry producers in the regional markets," he said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Presents New Cabinet List to Legislature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ramallah, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
here Wednesday present his new cabinet lineup to the Palestinian
Legislative Council (PLC) and pledged "accountability and
transparency" in all government institutions.
</P>
<P>
Although some new ministers are added to the list, Arafat made
no major changes in the reshuffle and most of the former key
cabinet members retained their presence in the new mix.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Shaath is to stay as the minister of planning and
international cooperation, while Saeb Erekat will retain his post
of minister of local government. The two have been very helpful to
Arafat in conducting peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat appointed new heads to the ministries of labor, industry
and agriculture and he himself maintained power over the Interior
Ministry which controls the Palestinian security forces.
</P>
<P>
He also took over the Education Ministry after relieving the
aging Yasser Amr, placing the ministry under the management of a
committee until new education minister is named.
</P>
<P>
Former ministers of labor, industry and agriculture have been
named ministers without portfolios and will remain in the new
cabinet. Munther Saleh was appointed minister of higher education
to replace Hanan Ashrawi, who was transferred to the portfolio of
tourism and archaeology.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also announced in the lineup three new ministries -
environment, parliamentary affairs and prisoners affairs - to be
headed by Yousef Abu Safieh, Nabil Amro and Hisham Abdul Razeq
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Before presenting his new cabinet list, Arafat addressed the
legislature about the situation in the territories and the current
development of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The platform of this new government is to continue building
Palestinian institutions, and reinforce law and order and the
foundations of an independent judiciary, pluralism, accountability
and transparency in all institutions of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
On the peace process, he said that no progress was made in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and the main reason for that is
Israel's intransigent policy.
</P>
<P>
he called on the U.S. to bear its responsibility pertaining the
peace process and officially announce its initiative requesting
Israel to withdraw from an additional 13.1 percent of the West
Bank in the second stage troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also urged the international community to take
immediate measures to pressure Israel to fulfill its obligations
toward peace and halt all activities which violate the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He called for reinforcing national unity for the purpose of
succeeding with the decision to be taken on May 4, 1999 - the
declaration of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The presentation of the new cabinet lineup received mixed
reactions. Shaath told Xinhua shortly after Arafat's announcement
that he believed the new team represented "a new, right direction"
for the Palestinian people and the new ministers have the
capability to improve management efficiency as required by the
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
But several lawmakers from other factions said this new
cabinet formulation does not meet the demands of the legislature
and the changes are insufficient.
</P>
<P>
Last year the PLC had accused Arafat's former cabinet members
of corruption and inefficiency, which led to 16 cabinet ministers'
offering to resign last August to pave the way for Arafat to
reshuffle the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In June this year, the lawmakers threatened to table the first
no-confidence vote against the PNA. On June 24, Arafat accepted
the resignation of the cabinet and has since conducted political
consultations with different parties over the formation of a new
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The legislature is to debate on the new cabinet line before
reaching a final decision, but no date was set to vote on the new
lineup. Endiem

<HEADLINE> Reactions Differ as Khat Dealers on Strike in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Somali capital and its
surrounding regions have been without the narcotic leaves known
as khat for the third day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to khat business dealers, the absence of the
stimulant leaves from Mogadishu's markets followed a seven-day
general strike by main khat importers.
</P>
<P>
One of the importers said the strike was prompted by a serious
misunderstanding between the Somali business dealers and khat
growers in Kenya for supplying them with the poorest quality
stuff on the highest price.
</P>
<P>
"They send the best quality type to Europe and to the Gulf
countries while the residue is always sent to us," lamented Ahmed
Ali, one khat seller in Black Sea Market of the capital, adding
"we can no longer tolerate this."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of the khat selling kiosks in Mogadishu were closed
down making hundreds of their dependents jobless.
</P>
<P>
A large number of tea shops alongside the main streets are now
complaining about less income following the start of the strike.
</P>
<P>
"We have to close down our business early in the evening...
since there are no khat chewing youngsters to accommodate,"
protested a lady running a tea shop.
</P>
<P>
Even though the strike had been on full scale, there are still
a few dealers who are bringing a very small amount of the drug in
an underground way. Each bundle of the khat (about 0.5 kg) which
was sold earlier at less than 20,000 Somali Shillings (nearly 2.5
Dollars) is now sold at more than 100,000 Shillings (about 12.5
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The absence of the narcotic leaves are beneficial in another
aspect. Hundreds or perhaps thousands of addicted armed
militiamen are now behaving themselves and reacting normally to
the daily occurrences.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, when high on the drug the gunmen especially those on
the battle wagons would shoot at people whenever they come across
a traffic jam, rather than using the vehicle horns.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, economists and health authorities are applauding
the strike and calling for a total ban on khat imports.
</P>
<P>
While doctors believe that the use of the narcotic leaves
brings about multiple social problems including health hazards,
impotence for men which put an end to numerous marriages every
month. Economists argue that the khat is seriously hurting the
already poor economy of the country.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Halting Kosovo Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Wednesday appealed to the
international community for help to put an end to the continued
Serbian security force operations against ethnic Albanians in
central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is totally convinced of the importance of putting an end
to the operations against innocent civilians living in Kosovo," a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Albanians are fleeing their homes in Kosovo as
Serbian forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army fight for control of
the Yugoslav province where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged all institutions defending human rights to
shoulder their responsibility in a bid to stem bloodshed and
prevent further deterioration of the situation in the entire
region.
</P>
<P>
"Appealing to the concerned parties for an immediate halt of
acts of violence, Egypt urged for the return of the Albanian
refugees to their homeland in order to reach a just settlement
rapidly through dialog, serious comprehension of co-existence and
tolerance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is currently following up with deep concern the latest
developments taking place in Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 people have been killed and 300 missing since the
crisis in Kosovo began in February.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Calls for Ending Cooperation With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi parliament on Wednesday
called on the government to stop cooperation immediately with the
U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq, known as UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The 250-member National Assembly adopted a resolution
unanimously on Wednesday's special session, urging the government
to sever relations with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The resolution came after disarmament talks between UNSCOM and
Iraq broke down on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the conclusion of a special session,
the Assembly says lawmakers believe that UNSCOM will never give
Iraq a clean bill of health on its weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The statement criticizes UNSCOM for creating pretexts to
prolong sanctions on Iraq, which serves the U.S. anti-Iraq policy.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait cannot be lifted unless UNSCOM verifies that it has
destroyed its chemical, biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly's statement calls for Iraqi leaders to take
necessary measures to safeguard its national interests, pledging
"full support" for any measures that President Saddam Hussein
takes.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly's resolution needs to be approved by the powerful
Revolutionary Command Council, with Saddam as chairman of the
decision-making body, but it paves the way for any possible
measures Iraqi leaders might take.
</P>
<P>
The statement also calls for the United Nations Security
Council to lift the sanctions, citing Iraq has fulfilled all its
obligations under relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared many times that it is free of prohibited
weapons, and accused UNSCOM of pursuing procrastination policy by
focusing on trivial, minor problems to waste time and prolong
work.

TEHRAN -- Iran announced on Wednesday that its foreign debts
have declined to 12.117 billion U.S. dollars by the end of last
Iranian year (March 21) from 16.835 dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Iran News quoted a report from the Central Bank of
Iran (CBI) as saying that included 3.289 billion dollars in
short-term debts and 8.828 billion dollars in medium and long-term
debts.
</P>
<P>
If contingent obligations, including opened letters of credit
not yet consigned and future interest are taken into account,
Iran's total external obligations amounted to 24.4 billion
dollars at the end of the year, the CBI report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Iran's external debt in the current Iranian year
would add up to 6.936 billion dollars, including 82 million
dollars for reschedulings under reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said Iran enjoyed a favorable trade balance of 3.511
billion dollars in the past Iranian year, and its liquidity stood
at almost 448 million dollars calculated according to the official
exchange of 3,000 rials against one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Iran's petro-dollars reached 18.5 billion dollars in 1996 when
oil prices were above 19 dollars per barrel, enabling the country
to repay some of its foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said earlier that the country's foreign debts declined
from 22 billion dollars in March 1995 to 16.835 billion dollars in
March 1996.

LAGOS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Electric power has fully returned
to all industrial consumers across Ghana after months of
rationing, while scheduled blackouts have been eased for some
domestic users, according to a report reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The development follows completion of the 30-megawatt Tema
Thermal Power Station, which will compensate for insufficient
output from the Asosombo Hydro-electric Plant where water levels
remain below the minimum required to drive all the turbines.

Excess electricity from industrial consumers will be used to
provide some communities with three continuous days of power at a

In recent months, domestic users have had to put up with
alternating 12- or 24-hour periods of supply and blackout.

<HEADLINE> Killing of Settlers Underlines Israeli Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Wednesday condemned the killing of two Jewish settlers
as serious crime, saying it proved the necessity of making
security arrangement in the current talks over the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
"I think this was a very, very serious crime," Netanyahu said
at his office. The killing underlined Israel's concern about
security and reaffirmed Israel's insistence that the Palestinians
should take every measure to fight terrorism, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two Jewish settlers were ambushed and killed early
Wednesday as they patrolled their settlement near the West Bank
town of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
"The building of houses, the building of homes for young
couples is not a reason for terror, not a reason to kill people,"
Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
The attackers could "probably" came from the
Palestinian-controlled areas, he said, admitting this had not been
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The incident further proved that it was necessary to make
security arrangement in any deal with the Palestinians concerning
the Israeli pullback from the West Bank, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Netanyahu had agreed to expand
Itzhar, the settlement where the shootings took place, but not
agreed to build new settlements. Settlement leaders would convene
soon to discuss the expansion, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Munzir Salah, newly-appointed minister of higher education of
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), told reporters in
Ramallah that since the Israeli government carried out a policy
"turning a whole people into desperate people," an explosion was
"inevitable."
</P>
<P>
Salah had been a member of the Palestinian lawmaker dealing
with settlement affairs on behalf of the PNA before he was named
Wednesday to replace Hanan Ashrawi by PNA President Yasser Arafat
as part of the cabinet reshuffle. Ashrawi was appointed minister
of tourism.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, speaking to the Palestinian Legislative Council before
announcing his new cabinet list, said Israel should bear "total
responsibility for the total freeze" of the peace process, warning
that "a total chaos" would occur if the process collapses.
</P>
<P>
He called on the United States to make public its initiative
calling on Israel to pullback its troops from 13.1 percent of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have rejected the latest Israeli proposal
during the latest round of talks Monday night, saying it was far
from consistent with the American initiative.
</P>
<P>
Israel proposed that it withdraw from 10 percent of the West
Bank and turn another 3 percent into a "nature reserve" where
Israel would be responsible for the overall security.
</P>
<P>
The killing, which capped frictions and tensions between the
Palestinians and the Israelis over the Jewish settlements, has
prompted calls from Israel's right-wingers for a halt of the
talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Peled, a member of the Likud coalition in the parliament,
said the killing proved that the Oslo process had bankrupted and
should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
He was echoed by Michael Kleiner, also a member of the Likud
coalition, who said Netanyahu should at least suspended the talks
with the Palestinians till they handed over the attackers to the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Kleiner also urged Netanyahu to drop a plan to free 100
Palestinian prisoners. Netanyahu was reportedly considering the
release as a goodwill gesture to the Palestinians but he himself
said Tuesday that no decision had been taken.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the Palestinians to catch the killers if they
escaped to the Palestinian-controlled areas, Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai insisted that the killing incident was
not connected with the current talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reports said that at a four-member inner cabinet
meeting Wednesday, Netanyahu presented to National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon and Industry and Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky a map drawn by the Defense Ministry showing the areas
Israel planned to yield, but the two ministers expressed their
reservations.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis have repeatedly rejected the Palestinian demand
during their talks that they show the map demonstrating the
locations of the lands they planned to hand over.

<HEADLINE> Belarussian Ruble Falls 17 Percent Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Belarussian ruble dropped 17
percent against the U.S. dollar in two days in transactions
between non-resident banks, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The rate plunged to 84,000-88,000 to the dollar on Wednesday,
down from Monday's 74,000-75,000 to the dollar on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The drop was attributed to the country's restrictions on
interbank currency operations and the subsequent downturn in
demand for the Belarussian ruble.
</P>
<P>
Under government regulations, the currency can be remitted to
non-resident banks only for a limited list of imported items,
while on the country's interbank market no deal in U.S. dollars,
German marks or Russian rubles should exceed 1,000 units of those
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Interfax, quoting experts in Minsk, the Belarussian capital,
said the Belarussian ruble could further slide to 90,000 against
the dollar before the end of week, less than half of the official
rate of 42,450 set on Wednesday by the National Bank of Belarus
(NBB).
</P>
<P>
However, the NBB was confident of its control over the
country's currency market.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the NBB said gold and currency assets of
the central bank and Finance Ministry total 630 million U.S.
dollars "enough to control the situation on the currency market,"
Interfax reported.

interest sections in friendly embassies in each other's capitals
by the end of 1998 and to relax their visa policies towards each
other's nationals.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have had no diplomatic relations since
Indonesia's takeover of East Timor in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The talks on autonomy, "without prejudice" to the two
countries' "basic positions of principle," will be held by their
senior officials with the hope that "an agreement could be reached
on this issue before the end of this year."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who held meetings in New
York with the ministers on Tuesday and today, described the
agreements as "a progress, if not a breakthrough".
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with an area of 18,889 square km and a population of
800 thousand, was a former Portuguese colony. In 1976 it became a
province of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly in a resolution adopted in 1977
rejected the claim that East Timor has been integrated into
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The autonomy, proposed by Indonesia, would allow East Timor full
governance except in the fields of foreign affairs, external
defense and some monetary policies, according to Alatas.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Optimistic About Resumed Talks in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Lakhdar Brahimi, the visiting U.
N. special envoy said Wednesday that he was optimistic about the
resumption of peace talks between the government and the rebel
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Brahimi noted here that although the danger of renewed war is
over, the two sides should observe the 1994 Lusaka peace deal and
resume talks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador to Angola and also U.S.
representative to Angolan peace process, Donald Steinberg, said
both the government and UNITA have promised to resume talks to
save the peace process from the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Angola becomes tense after UNITA has
re-captured about 90 cities and town it formerly handed over to
the government and its military men allegedly killed about 200 in
the July 21 massacre.
</P>
<P>
To help solve the crisis, Brahimi arrived in Luanda last
Friday to meet Angolan President Eduard dos Santos and UNITA
Chairman Jonas Savimbi on mediation efforts.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Diplomat on Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian diplomat said
here Wednesday that the long-running peace deadlock with Israel
has made it impossible to make a sweeping overhaul of the
Palestinian cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Mohamad Sobeih, Palestine's chief delegate to the Arab League
and secretary of the Palestinian National Council, made the remark
to the Middle East News Agency hours after Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat presented a new cabinet
lineup to Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC).
</P>
<P>
According to the new lineup, there were 10 new faces in the
cabinet while all former ministers but one remained.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih termed the new Palestinian cabinet formation as having
"minimal changes" in ministerial posts.
</P>
<P>
"The formation of the Palestinian government hinges directly on
the position of the peace talks situation with Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the latest round of Palestinian-Israeli talks has
failed in realizing progress as Israel continues to offer "old"
ideas in conflict with the American proposal for another 13.1
percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinian side will hold contacts with Arab
countries concerned and brief the American administration on the
outcome of the latest contacts with the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to make
believe that there is progress and rapprochement between the two
sides," he charged.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih asked the U.S. administration to promptly step in and
formally declare its initiative. The U.S. plan has was accepted by
Palestinians but resisted by Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis started their direct talks in
July 19. Israel proposed to pull out from 10 percent of West Bank
territories, and turn the other 3 percent into a "nature reserve."
This has been rejected by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Suspends Cooperation With U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq announced Wednesday to
suspend cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors until conditions
it sets have been met, a strong effort believed designed to see
the eight-year-old U.N. sanctions on it lifted early.
</P>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein made the decision soon after a
parliament special session called on the Iraqi leaders to stop
cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a joint meeting of the powerful
Revolutionary Command Council and the ruling Baath Party chaired
by Saddam.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said the president decided to
"immediately and completely suspend" cooperation with both the
U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq, known as UNSCOM, and
the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
One of the conditions set is the recomposition of UNSCOM. Iraq
demands equal representation of the member states of the Security
Council on the Special Commission, and Iraq's participation in
UNSCOM work as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Another one is to move UNSCOM headquarters to Geneva from New
York with an aim to keep the Commission from the U.S. direct
influence.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also asks for a rotation of UNSCOM chairmanship among the
five permanent members of the Security Council, which means Iraq
wants the removal of UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler from his
position.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused UNSCOM and Butler as U.S. puppets in Washington's
drive to intentionally prolong the sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made when Iraq has repeated several times that
the sanctions must be lifted in the near future.
</P>
<P>
However, the sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait can only be lifted when U.N. inspectors verify that the
country is free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of UNSCOM-Iraq talks on the issue collapsed
last Monday.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers in South Lebanon Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting President of the 52nd
United Nations General Assembly Guinadi Audvedenko Wednesday
spoke highly of the role the U.N. peacekeeping force is playing in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is playing
a sacred role in a peace mission, adding the troops also provide
social and humanitarian help to local people.
</P>
<P>
Audvedenko made the remark at the headquarters of the UNIFIL at
Naqoura, a southern boundary town.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong U.N. peacekeeping force was established in
1978 following the first Israeli invasion of Lebanon. It was to
help the Lebanese government restore authority over its southern
territory and confirm Israeli withdrawal from the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said he is pleased with the visit to the
troops whose mandate has just been renewed for another six months
by the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Resolution 425 and its related Resolution 426
concerning Lebanon, the term of UNIFIL is extended every six
months under the request of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The previous term expired at the end of July this year.
</P>
<P>
When visiting Quana, a village on the north of the Israeli
occupied south Lebanon where some 106 Lebanese civilians were
killed during an Israeli military operation in April, 1996,
Audvedenko said that Lebanon can never enjoy stability and peace
unless Israel withdraws its troops unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 after two invasions with the claimed aim of
protecting its northern villages from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Audvedenko arrived in Lebanon Monday on a two-day visit during
which he had held talks with Lebanon's top leaders over the
regional situation and the role of UNIFIL in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He is to leave for New York Thursday morning.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Climb Up Slightly in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Affected by production slips
in aircraft and automobiles, orders to U.S. factories edged only
0.1 percent higher in June, the Commerce Department reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The monthly factory orders totaled a seasonally adjusted 330.5
billion U.S. dollars, according to the department. In May, they
had fallen 2.2 percent, the biggest drop in three years, to a
seasonally adjusted 330.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders in the second quarter were 0.7 percent lower
than that of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report today, the Labor Department said that
employment remained strong despite the manufacturing slowdown. The
number of first-time applications for unemployment benefits edged
higher last week but still kept at a low level.
</P>
<P>
Except transportation, the manufacturing picture is less gloomy
than the overall situation. Orders increased 1.1 percent in June
following a 1.8 percent decrease the month before.
</P>
<P>
Orders for computer and office equipment jumped 7 percent. They
increased 1.6 percent for industrial machinery, 3.5 percent for
stone, clay and glass products and 6.5 percent for navigation,
medical and other instruments.
</P>
<P>
But orders dropped 21.6 percent for aircraft, exceeding a 16.1
percent drop the month before, and 6.9 percent for automotive
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Overall, orders for durable goods, big-ticket items intended to
last three or more years, slipped 0.1 percent while orders for
non-durable goods rose 0.3 percent, the first increase since
March. Food products and chemicals recorded the largest increases
within non-durables.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, shipments, a measure of current production,
increased 0.3 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted 334.6
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders fell for the fourth time in five
months. It declined 0.8 percent to 529.3 billion dollars.
Inventories of unsold goods edged 0.2 percent higher, to 466.6
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir: Malaysia to Continue Raising Funds Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday Malaysia will push ahead with
efforts to raise funds abroad to revive its economy.
</P>
<P>
But the means by which the government would do this would not
be made public to prevent "rogue currency speculators" from
derailing such efforts, he said at a gathering in Ipoh, northern
state of Perak, some 205 kilometers from here, according to
Malaysia's national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
"We will find other means (to raise funds) but we cannot reveal
them because then the rogue currency speculators will find ways to
derail our efforts," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the government had to borrow from foreign sources
and not from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to enable the
two agencies recently set up by the government to purchase
non-performing loans and recapitalize local companies.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the latest tactics to undermine Malaysia's
economy became apparent when two days before Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim was scheduled to leave for an overseas trip to
explain the country's economy and raise foreign funds, the rogue
currency speculators downgraded Malaysia's credit rating through
two international credit rating agencies, Moody's and Standard &AMP;
Poor's.
</P>
<P>
He said after attacking the country's currency which had
dropped by over 60 percent and the stock market which plunged
across the board, these rogue speculators were now attacking
Malaysia's ability to raise funds abroad.
</P>
<P>
"They deliberately undermined our efforts to revive our own
economy," he said, adding their only intention was to destroy the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's proposed roadshow was to raise 2 billion ringgit (0.5
billion U.S. dollars) in the international capital market to be
used as funding for Pengurusan Danaharta Nasional Bhd, the asset
management company set up to buy over the non-performing loans of
the banking system.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said these speculators not only wanted to control the
economies of countries in Asia but also their politics and
determine who their leaders should be.
</P>
<P>
He said these speculators were not only greedy for money but
also for power to control the economy, politics and to control the
world.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his main objective in meeting the people was to
explain to them the situation faced by the country to enable them
to understand the problem.
</P>
<P>
He said what was important was that the people did not create
chaos in the country and instead maintained their solidarity.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the people that if there was chaos, the government
would not be able to concentrate on reviving the economy.
</P>
<P>
"We need the concentration, we must face it and if there are
all sorts of things happening behind our backs, maybe we will not
be successful," he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the people should understand the economic turmoil,
which could be considered extraordinary, because if they did not
comprehend it they would not be concerned.

<P>
DALIAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, China's top legislator,
recently stressed the importance of pollution control and
environmental protection and the implementation of related laws
and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), made the comments in a fact-finding trip to Dalian
in northeast China's Liaoning Province between August 4-6.
</P>
<P>
Li was on his fifth visit to the city, one of China's six top
cleanest cities, and noted "great changes" in local environmental
protection projects and in the implementation of environmental
laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
He also visited the Xinghai Bay Business Zone and commended the
local government's efforts to transform the former saltern and
garbage dump into a picturesque complex with conference, business
and recreation facilities.
</P>
<P>
Li exhibited special interest in pollution control at
coal-fired power plants. He visited the Huaneng Dalian Power Plant
and voiced approval for the facilities dust removal rate of 99
percent. He encouraged the plant's management to continue to
attach high importance environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a forum attended by local officials, legislators
and local residents, Li said that environmental protection is a
basic state policy which is directly related to China's long-range
development. He stressed that "pollution control and environmental
protection will promote both economic and social efficiency."
</P>
<P>
He pointed to Dalian's achievements as a clean city, but noted
that it has a long way to meet standards for one of the world's
cleanest cities. Li urged local authorities to continue
implementing the state policy on sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Li urged legislators and local residents to supervise the
enforcement of China's seven environmental protection laws.
</P>
<P>
Li also conducted a study on modifications to the Law on the
Organization of Village Committees.

<HEADLINE> Laboratory Tests Cocaine Addiction Blocker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Human testing is expected to
begin this fall on a drug that appears to block cocaine
addiction in laboratory animals and might have promise for use
against other addictions, The Washington Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Department of Energy's Brookhaven
National Laboratory said Wednesday that the drug gamma
vinyl-GABA, or GVC, could be an improvement over methadone, the
most commonly used antidote to cocaine addiction for three decades.
</P>
<P>
The drug, now used fro treatment of epilepsy in Europe and
Canada, is marketed by Hoechst Marion Roussel, a unit of Hoechst
AG in Germany. Brookhaven researchers became interested in it
because it reduces the level of a brain chemical called
dopamine, which causes the "high" feelings from drugs.
</P>
<P>
Cocaine appears to increase dopamine production. But
laboratory animals given GVG in addition to cocaine retained
normal levels of dopamine.

WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of the U.S. new
applications filed for unemployment benefits increased slightly
last week but remained at a level signaling a plentiful supply of
jobs, the Labor Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Claims rose to a seasonally adjusted 307,000, up from a 15-week
low of 301,000 the week before, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The figure is well below the 394,000 claims registered for two
consecutive weeks in late June and early July, when workers idled
by the U.S. No. 1 car-maker--- the General Motors strikes which
lasted for nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
A four-week moving average of claims fell to 315,500, down from
337,250 for the four-week period ended a week earlier. It was the
lowest level since mid-May.
</P>
<P>
The report indicates that demand for labor remained strong at
midsummer despite a dramatic slowdown in overall economic growth
in the second quarter of the year.

<HEADLINE> Wu Bangguo Visits Traditional Industrial Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China's central government pays
close attention to the reemployment and basic subsistence of
workers declared redundant by state-owned enterprises, as well as
transferring management authority over key coal mines to lower
levels of government and development of petroleum industry,
according to Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo.
</P>
<P>
Wu, also member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China Central Committee, made the remark during a visit to
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, one of China's
traditional industrial bases, between August 3-6.
</P>
<P>
Wu's visit focused on implementing the State Council's
policy for transferring management authority over key coal mines to
lower levels of government.
</P>
<P>
He said the major difficulty centers on the overproduction of
coal. He said China must control total coal production, downsize
the sectors work force and improve production efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that transferring management authority over key
coal mines is expected to help the industry overcome present
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
China will adopt measures to close various small and illegal
mines, said Wu, adding that plans calls for increasing subsidies
to provinces and cities facing great difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Wu also held meetings covering the issue of ensuring basic
subsistence for laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
He visited the high-tech development zone at Daqing Oil Field
and stressed that the industry should continue to introduce high
technology and noted that oil prices should be in line with
international market.
</P>
<P>
China's oil industry should strive to achieve its target of 10
billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) in profits in the next five
months of 1998, said Wu.

<HEADLINE> Russian Tax Service Seizes Property of Oil Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Tax Service has
seized the property of three oil companies in a crackdown on
defaulting corporate tax payers.
</P>
<P>
The action against the property and bank accounts of Sidanco,
Onaco and the Eastern Oil Company (EOC) began Wednesday, said
Vladimir Popov, head of the Tax Service's department responsible
for dealing with major taxpayers and the forcible collection of
tax arrears.
</P>
<P>
Popov said bankruptcy procedures will be started for Onaco.
Sidanco and EOC will soon face the same fate, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sidanco's tax debt totals 1.2 billion rubles (about 190 million
U.S. dollars). Onaco's debt stood at 845.8 million rubles (136
million dollars) on August 1. The EOC owes the Tax Service 314.1
million rubles (50.7 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
In July, Russia's oil companies paid 612.1 million rubles (92
million dollars) of tax, less than half of the planned amount of
1.5 billion rubles (242 million dollars), which prompted the Tax
Service to step up pressure.
</P>
<P>
"It is not war, it is the beginning of work," Popov said,
adding that August would be a decisive month for all the oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has been trying hard to boost revenues
in the face of mounting deficits. The oil companies, usually the
country's largest tax payers, bore the brunt of an offensive
against tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Other measures taken against the oil companies include
restriction of their access to pipelines used for exporting oil.

<HEADLINE> Singapore MP Welcomes Call for New Singapore- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Singapore
Parliament Thursday expressed welcome to a call from his Malaysian
counterpart for building new Singapore-Malaysian ties.
</P>
<P>
Tan Cheng Bock, leader of Singapore-Southeast Asia
Parliamentary Group, said to the media, "I fully welcome Lim Kit
Siang's proposal. My colleagues and I will be pleased to take part
in such a conference when we receive the invitation from the
Malaysian Parliament."
</P>
<P>
Tan Cheng Bock was referring to a news report that Malaysian
Member of Parliament Lim Kit Siang called for a full mandate to be
given to "parliamentary delegations of both countries to try to
achieve consensus to build new Malaysia-Singapore ties which could
work closely for the sake of peace, development, democracy and
human rights."
</P>
<P>
Lim Kit Siang was also quoted as saying that "Malaysian
Parliament should officially invite Singapore Parliament to hold
Malaysia-Singapore parliamentary conference where delegations of
both countries were given the mandate to resolve CIQ (customs,
immigration and quarantine) issue and other bilateral issues."
</P>
<P>
Relations between Singapore and Malaysia have been recently
soured over a number of issues including the dispute over
Malaysia's CIQ operation in the Tajong Pagar Railway Station which
is located within Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs
rejected a Malaysian news report saying "Singapore shortens social
visit stay for Malaysians."
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the ministry said, "There has not been any
changes in Singapore's immigration policy in relation to the grant
of social visit passes to foreign visitors. Most foreign visitors
arriving by land are granted 14 days' stay. There may be certain
exceptional cases where visitors are granted fewer than 14 days
due to the 60/90 day rule, which has been enforced since June 1,
1981."
</P>
<P>
The 60/90 day rule allows a Malaysian social visitor to stay in
Singapore up to 60 days in every 90 day period. The purpose of the
60/90 day rule is to prevent foreign workers from circumventing
Singapore's work permit policies and working in Singapore
illegally.
</P>
<P>
The grant of social visit passes to foreign visitors by
Singapore Immigration &AMP; Registration is in no way linked to the
move of the Singapore CIQ from Tajong Pagar to Woodlands Train
Check Point, the ministry explained.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Young offenders from four
correctional institutions in Hong Kong have obtained good results
in this year's Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination
(HKCEE), a spokesman for the Correctional Services Department said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 55 young offenders sat for the 1998 HKCEE where they
took 183 papers covering subjects in mathematics, history,
computer studies, social studies and technical drawings. They
achieved one distinction, 14 credits and 81 passes, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The results of the 1998 HKCEE were officially announced
Thursday. The pass rate for the four institutions was 52.45
percent.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the good results reflect the Correctional
Services Department's efforts to provide every opportunity for
young offenders to learn and equip themselves with knowledge in
preparation for their eventual release back into society.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past few years, with the generous donation from the
Hong Kong Jockey Club Trust Fund, we have been able to provide a
number of sophisticated educational equipment to improve teaching
facilities for inmates," he said.
</P>
<P>
These are just some of the plans in which the department is
developing to further enhance the educational environment for
inmates, the spokesman said. "With academic qualifications, they
stand a better chance of competing for better jobs," he added.

MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia expelled 30 foreign
intelligence officers and detained seven Russian nationals who
worked for foreign spy agencies in 1997, the Interfax news agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Security Service (FSB) had exposed more than 400

suspected of being affiliated with them", said Alexander
Zdanovich, chief of the FSB Public Relations Center.

He singled out the FSB's success in foiling attempts by
representatives of Sanam, an Iranian industrial group, to collect
data on Russia's latest advances in space, aviation, nuclear and
laser fields.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the FSB Anti-Terrorism Department thwarted 134
terrorist plots and exposed 34 arms trading gangs, seizing 92
bombs, Zdanovich said.
</P>
<P>
The bombs were intended for use in contract murders and
terrorist activities, he said.

<HEADLINE> DECD: Germany Joblessness Still High Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- German unemployment will remain high
despite faster economic growth in 1999, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forecast in a report
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its 1998 report on Germany, the Paris-based organization
expected German jobless rate, which hit a post-1930s record of
12.6 percent early this year, to fall slightly to 11.1 percent in
1999 from a 1998 average of 11.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that unemployment in the eastern area of Germany,
officially at 17.4 percent at present, would be particularly high
in the coming year as a result of excessive wages and low
productivity.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that German economic growth would rise to
2.9 percent in 1999, compared to about 2.7 percent this year and
2.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Such growth and unemployment level showed that German economy
was experiencing difficult fiscal adjustment and major structural
change, according to the organization.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, It stressed further reforms in the system of
taxation, social welfare and pensions, plus improved public sector
efficiency, as very necessary for Germany to boost employment and
ensure continued economic upswing.

from the left side and arched a long cross, which was headed home
by teammate Ding Lei.
</P>

leap from the bottom of the 14-team standings to climb to the 12th
place. The Wuhan side, which was playing its first season in the
first division league, now holds a win-draw-loss records of 3-6-7
after 16-round competition.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky entered a federal courthouse here on Thursday to
testify on her relationship with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
She was ready to testify to a federal grand jury that she had a
sexual relationship with Clinton, unidentified sources were quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old was whisked into a side entrance of the
courthouse, avoiding a crowd of more than a hundred journalists
who had gathered overnight.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Lewinsky, who had undergone intense preparation
with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's prosecutors, was ready to
testify truthfully and anxious to finish the painful ordeal.
</P>
<P>
Clinton denied an affair in his testimony in the Paula Jones
civil suit against him. The president will testify to the federal
grand jury on August 17 by closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky was granted blanket immunity from prosecution by Starr
in return for her testimony.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are investigating whether Clinton committed perjury
in the Jones lawsuit and conspired with Lewinsky and others to
cover up their relationship.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton's mood was "great", White House spokesman
Barry Toiv said Wednesday. "Obviously he is spending some time on
preparing for his testimony," he said.

WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that Iraq's freezing of cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors was "unacceptable" and threatened to keep pressure on
until Iraq complies with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"This noncompliance is completely unacceptable," White House
spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow Iraq access to the resources necessary to
restart their weapons of mass destruction program," he said. "We
will keep the pressure on until Iraq complies fully" with the
U.N.-mandated inspections program.
</P>
<P>
Crowley also said Iraq failed to provide required escorts on
Thursday to a U.N. inspections team seeking to leave its
compound in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the failure to provide the escorts was an indication
that Iraq's threats of noncompliance were being carried out
although there had been no inspection scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"We have evidence on the ground that Iraq is beginning to
follow through on its threats," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>

SHENYANG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The body of Lin Ti-chuan, a
Taiwanese woman who was allegedly detained becaused of a business
dispute and later was found dead in northeast China's Liaoning
Province on July 30, was transported today from Haicheng and will
return to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, after making a stopover in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The local public security bureau received a report of Lin's
kidnapping from Wei Tein-kang, Lin's boyfriend who is also a
Taiwan compatriot, on the afternoon of July 29. Jia Chunwang,
minister of Public Security, on the same day ordered the
provincial police department to crack the case as soon as possible.
Zhang Guoguang, governor of Liaoning Province, also made
instructions to the same effect.
</P>
<P>
Lin's body was found in the mortuary of the city's hospital on

<P>
When Lin's family members and relatives and some Taiwan
reporters arrived in Dalian on the evening of July 31, they did
not have the required documents for entry to the Chinese
mainland. Emergency steps were taken to help them go through the
necessary formalities as soon as possible, and they left Dalian
for Haicheng on the morning of Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland parties concerned did their utmost to meet
the demands of Lin's family members and relatives and offered
greatest possible help, officials said. They allowed a religious
service to be conducted for the dead, though such activities are
banned here, and they set up a mourning hall whose setting
received praise from Taiwan professionals.
</P>
<P>
All applications for reporting the incident from the Taiwanese
side were approved, and nearly 40 Taiwanese journalists gathered
in Haicheng within several days. The city government offered the
reporters convenience, and an official was assigned to provide
help and coordination.
</P>
<P>
"We are shocked and feel sad at the incident, and we hope to
catch the criminals as soon as possible," said a city taxi driver
during an interview with the Taiwan media.
</P>
<P>
A large number of policemen have been mobilized to solve the
crime, and police departments at all levels are focusing on the
case.

"We are capable of cracking the case, and it will not take
long," said Liu Gang, director of the city police bureau, while

A moving donation ceremony was held in the conference hall of
the Haicheng Hotel on the morning of Aug. 2. Local entrepreneurs
and women representatives who were present at the ceremony
expressed their sympathy and solicitude for the family members and
relatives of Lin Ti-chuan. They all condemned the crime and
expressed their hope that the case would not negatively affect
cross-Straits ties.
</P>
<P>
Eight local entrepreneurs donated 85,000 yuan to Lin's father
and expressed the hope that people from both sides of the Taiwan
Straits would be as dear to each other as in the past.
</P>
<P>
Relevant authorities on the mainland made meticulous efforts to
communicate with Lin's family members and to satisfy their demands
while taking into consideration the laws and regulations. They
also clarified some facts about the examination of Lin's remians
and about the Straits Exchange Foundation's demand of sending
representatives to the mainland to help deal with the case.
</P>
<P>
Lin's father time and again gave thanks for the great help
given by concerned departments on the Chinese mainland in dealing
with the death of his daughter.
</P>
<P>
The father's demands for preserving the body of his dead
daughter, holding religious services and transporting the remains
back to Taiwan have all been satisfied since the first day he
arrived in Haicheng, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the autopsy, the father insisted that he would bring
a complete body of his dead daughter back to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to related Chinese laws, examinations must be
performed on victims of criminal cases. The Beijing-based ARATS,
the Liaoning Provincial Taiwan Affairs Office and officials of
Haicheng city invited medical experts from Shenyang, capital city
of Liaoning Province, to minimize the examinations and reduce any
harm to the body.

<HEADLINE> Djibouti to Consider More Incentives for Malaysian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Djibouti which already
offers tax-free investment returns for up to 10 years, is willing
to consider further incentives for Malaysian investors.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti is willing to discuss further the kind of incentives
needed by Malaysian investors, Djiboutian President Hassan Gouled
Aptidon told a press conference at the end of his six-day official
visit here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We requested Malaysia to send to Djibouti a mission to explore
the opportunities and discuss ways and means of how to accommodate
their needs," said Aptidon who will stay in Malaysia on a private
program for three more days before leaving for China and Japan
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said he was glad that a high level delegation from Malaysia
would be visiting Djibouti soon.
</P>
<P>
Aptidon said Djibouti's location itself at the Horn of the
African continent offered Malaysian investors a strategic gateway
not only to the continent but also to the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
"I insist that Malaysian businessmen and investors come to our
country to see for themselves the fields they can venture into,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Djibouti signed two agreements with Malaysia
on the promotion and protection of investment and on economic,
scientific, technical and cultural cooperation.

<HEADLINE> English Premier League Richest in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The English Premier League is the
richest football division in the world, according to a survey
released here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the millions the game is generating are pouring straight
into the players' wallets and failing to reach the game at grass
roots level.
</P>
<P>
The benefits of vast amounts of money going into English
football are only being reaped by the top players and overseas
clubs, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Looking at 1996/97, the Premier League is the biggest in the
world in financial terms, with an average side generating an
annual income of 23.2 million pounds (37.88 million U.S. dollars),
against 20.9m for teams in Italy's Series A, 11.6m in Spain's
Primer League and 10.5m in French first division, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
English's soccer's financial power has since been boosted as
the full benefits of a lucrative new contract with pay TV BSkyB
began to feed through from 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
Total income for English soccer grew 31 percent to 675 million
pounds in 1996/97, with the Premier League generating almost 70
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The top five finishers in last season's FA Carling Premiership
-Manchester United, Newcastle United, Arsenal, Liverpool and Aston
Villa - had a combined turnover greater than that of all 72 clubs
in the lower divisions.
</P>
<P>
English clubs spent nearly 250m buying players, with Premier
League clubs accounting for 178m, of which Leeds United was the
biggest spender.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Deloitte &AMP; Touche Annual Review of Football Finance
shows wages are set to spiral further out of control, with some
players pocketing more than 30,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
But the gap between the top flight teams and the rest of the
league is increasing.
</P>
<P>
Boon said: "The financial divide between the premier league and
football league is turning from gap, to chasm, to abyss. Worse
still, the desire to bride that gap is tempting many football
league clubs to live beyond their means, often with disastrous
consequences if the gamble doesn't pay off.
</P>
<P>
Smaller sides are also losing out under the Bosman ruling,
which means their star players can be transferred for free when
their contracts ran out.
</P>
<P>
Many clubs were picking up players on free transfers, only to
have to pay huge salaries to tempt them to sign.
</P>
<P>
The report states that Premiership players' wages increased by
35% in 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
The link between wage bills and on field success remained
strong, with the top four clubs in the Premier Leagues having the
highest wage bills.
</P>
<P>
The study notes that ambitious clubs with their sights on the
Premiership were continuing to spend heavily to reach their goal,
a strategy which many would not be able to sustain.
</P>
<P>
The wages bills at 12 clubs exceeded their annual turnovers,
while a further 35 clubs had wage bills worth more than two-thirds
of their turnovers.

CAIRO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's inflation rate dropped to a record low of 3.6
percent in May, the latest bulletin released by the Central Bank
of Egypt said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund in a report on Egypt's economic
performance attributed the success to hold back the inflation to
Egypt's ongoing trade liberalization and the structural reform,
which increase competition and reduce pressure on prices from
monopolistic practices.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus' foreign trade volume reached 465.8 million
Cyrus pounds (about 931.6 million U.S. dollars) in the first
quarter in 1998, an increase of 42.7 million pounds (about 85.4
million dollars) over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The lastest report released Wednesday by the Department of
Statistics and Research with the Finance Ministry showed that
exports amounted to 157.5 million pounds (about 315 million
dollars) in the first quarter of this year from 146.5 million
pounds (about 293 million dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Japan has agreed to grant Jordan 70,000 U.S. dollars
for its water projects in southern Jordan, Jordan's official news
agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The projects aim to ease the water shortage in Tafileh, Ma'an
and Aqaba and make clean water available for the poor in these
areas.
</P>
<P>
The grants are part of a Japanese aid plan for Jordan and Japan
has donated 2.8 million dollars to Jordan so far under the plan.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The European Union (EU) has agreed to provide 42
million U.S. dollars to help modernize Lebanese administrative
system, the Daily star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used for training government staff members
and upgrading office appliances for government departments.

<HEADLINE> D.R.Congo Faces Serious Rebellion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of Congo
(D.R.Congo) is facing a serious conflict after rebels elected a
political chief in Goma to coordinate the fight against the
government of Laurent-Desire Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Veteran political opposition leader Arthur Zahidi Ngoma was
elected Wednesday as the chief of the rebellion staged by Tutsi
Banyamulenge soldiers, who are Congolese originated from Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Born on September 18, 1947, in Kalima in the province of
Maniema, eastern Congo, Zahidi Ngoma is a native Congolese and was
an opponent of both former President Mobutu Sese Seko and
President Kabila.
</P>
<P>
A specialist in international law and educated at the Sorbonne
University, Paris, Ngoma had worked for the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and
served briefly as prime minister under Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the eastern Kivu region said that the situation
there was getting worse as rebel soldiers had taken control of the
city of Uvira in southern Kivu, after fierce fighting between the
rebels and soldiers loyal to the government Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who declared their rebellion against the government
on Sunday, already have control of Goma and Bukavu, the two major
cities in the Kivu region.
</P>
<P>
Fighting was also reported in the northern city of Kisangani and
the extreme western city of Kitona, where a big military base is
located.
</P>
<P>
The government Wednesday again condemned Rwanda for backing
the rebellion and threatened to "export war to Rwanda".
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa also called on the international community to treat
Rwanda as "a criminal state" which it said should not be allowed
to take advantage of the sympathy from the world for the 1994
genocide suffered by the country.
</P>
<P>
While denying involvement in the war, Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu said that "if there is serious reason to be involved,
Rwanda will jump into the dancing pool".
</P>
<P>
The rebellion started after President Kabila ordered all
military personnel of Rwanda to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda was believed to have played a big role in helping Kabila
come to power 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Kivu region is a hotbed for the growth of renegades
engaging different governments in the region, including those of
Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Capable to Defend Itself: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Thursday said his country is fully capable to defend itself
without any outside help.
</P>
<P>
"With the grace of Allah, we can defend ourselves on our own,
it is a big achievement," Sharif said in reference to Pakistan's
matching response to India's nuclear explosions on May 28 and 30.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the special session of the Senate marking
the silver jubilee of the parliament's upper house.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that Pakistan was offered a lucrative
package before May 28 to stave off a befitting response to India's
nuclear explosions.
</P>
<P>
"But we refused to accept that in view of the track record of
such assurances in the past," he said. "No country can survive as
a sovereign and independent state by living on borrowed crutches."
</P>
<P>
Referring to his last week meeting with Indian Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee in Colombo, Sri Lanka, he said the core issue
of Kashmir figured atop in the bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
"I asked the Indian prime minister that officials should start
talks from where they were left off on June 23," he said. Pakistan
and India's foreign secretaries sign an agreement in their talks
here in June last year with Kashmir and security related issues
topping the list.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian prime minister showed reluctance and said it is
difficult to sell this in India. Then I said it is difficult to
sell vice versa in Pakistan," Sharif recalled.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also urged the international community particularly the
U.N. Security Council to play its due role in the just resolution
of the Kashmir dispute.

LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The British Foreign Office on

Kabila has spread to the west of the Democratic Congo with
fighting in an oil town and a naval base.

<HEADLINE> Mainland Protects Taiwan Compatriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese official on
cross-Straits affairs reiterated today that mainland authorities
have always exhibited concern and consistently worked to the
legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs offices for both
the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State
Council, made the remark during a banquet held for delegates
attending the seventh Seminar on Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
"Solutions to problems resulting from contacts between people
across the Straits center on protecting the rights of Taiwan
compatriots, and finding solutions for political differences
concerning their fundamental rights," according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Wide-ranging contacts, including economic and cultural
exchanges, between people across the Taiwan Straits have increased
in recent years thanks to the joint efforts of people on both
sides, said Chen. However, criminal activities which have
increased along with contacts have endangered both the well-being
and property of people on both sides of the straits.
</P>
<P>
He lamented the recent death of Lin Ti-chuan, a Taiwan woman
who was allegedly kidnaped and consequently died of as yet
undetermined causes, and vowed to apprehend and severely punish the
perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
Chen warned against any attempts to use the case to create
disputes between the two sides of the Straits and hinder the
development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated both the mainland's stand of holding political
talks between the two sides at the earliest possible date and the
invitation for Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation to visit to China between mid-September and mid-October
this year.

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Office Denies Claims of Gaddafi Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The British Foreign Office on
Thursday categorically denied claims that British agents attempted
to assassinate Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The claims were made by a former member of Britain's security
services MI6, David Shayler, who was arrested in Paris last
weekend and is fighting moves to extradite him back to Britain.
</P>
<P>
"The central claim that there was an official plot to kill
Gaddafi is untrue," a Foreign Office spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It is inconceivable in normal peacetime circumstances that
authority for the secret intelligence services to conduct
assassination attempts would be granted," he added.
</P>
<P>
The claims were reported in Thursday's Guardian newspaper after
appearing first in the New York Times on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Guardian, Shayler allegedly said that
Britain's foreign intelligence service MI6 tried to kill Gaddafi
in February 1996 by planting a bomb under his motorcade. But, he
said, agents placed the bomb under the wrong car, killing several
bystanders.
</P>
<P>
Britain has traditionally revealed little about the work of MI5
and its partner agency, MI6, which gathers intelligence abroad.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England's Monetary
Policy Committee decided on Thursday to keep interest rates
unchanged at 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many experts had predicted the rate would remain unmoved in
view of the gloomy outlook for the British economy.
</P>
<P>
The decision came as a relief to home owners and businesses,
but it will spark fresh demands for the committee to cut rates.
</P>
<P>
Ian Peters, deputy director general of the British Chambers
of Commerce, warmly welcomed the decision, saying: "This decision
plainly reflects the now abundant 'real world' evidence that the
economy is slowing sufficiently."
</P>
<P>
But he said the manufacturing industry "remains dangerously
close to the brink and job losses and company closures will
continue".
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that in September the Monetary Policy Committee
must cut rates by 0.25 percent."
</P>
<P>
Financial markets had expected no change after a monthly
rate-setting meeting and although Sterling dipped on the news, it
soon recovered.
</P>
<P>
Already weak shares barely budged and British government bonds
soon lost the modest gains made on the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates have risen six times since the election in May
of last year, from six percent to 7.5 percent.

ADDIS ABABA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
Thursday calls on all parties involved in the crisis in the
Democratic Republic of Congo to "exercise restraint and seek a
peaceful solution."
</P>
<P>
According to an OAU press release faxed to Xinhua, Salim also
appealed to "countries of the region to help in promoting a
peaceful solution, which takes into account the need to respect
the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the
Democratic Republic of Congo."
</P>

time when efforts were being deployed to promote the building of
foundations for a stable and democratic Congo," Salim said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief went on to call for the convergence of all
efforts to promote a speedy and peaceful solution to the present
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Salim said he is undertaking consultations with the leaders of
the region and will be dispatching a mission to Kinshasa to
consult with the authorities there as well as to the countries of
the region to see how best the OAU can make its contribution to

</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Chinese Chess Association (CCA), the Russian

draw in the 120,000 U.S. dollars duel.
</P>
<P>
If they were deadlocked at 5:5 after 10 games, the two sides
would meet in a 11th game. But if the 11th game still ended with
a tie, the outcome would be decided with a draw.
</P>
<P>
Xie Jun, who won the world champion in 1991, was dethroned by
Polgar after 13 games in Jaen, Spain, in 1996.
</P>

yesterday morning with a maximum force of eight, Typhoon Otto has
quickly subsided by force less than six as it moved northwest,
bringing heavy rain and rainstorms to most of Fujian and the
southeast of neighboring Jiangxi province, according to China
Central Meteorological Station.
</P>
<P>
Having subsided to low pressure, meteorologists said that
Typhoon Otto will not cause strong winds and rains in China over
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The experts pointed out that typhoon activities this year have
showed a queer pattern, with only two formed as late as August 5,
and predicted that five to seven typhoons will land in China
within the next three months.
</P>
<P>
China has an area of about 290,000 square kilometers affected
by typhoons each year, mainly in the more developed coastal
region. Experts warn provinces to closely follow the typhoon to
prepare for emergencies and protect people's lives and properties.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that eleven coastal provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions have invested close to one
billion yuan in consolidating 611 reservoirs and 1,733 kilometers of
levees. Up to now 226 counties and cities, or about 70 percent of
the total in the coastal region, have established systems
receiving satellite cloud maps.
</P>
<P>
The coastal region has also increased their supplies of flood
control materials.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Parties Reject New Seat Numbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian opposition parties
are threatening to boycott the National Assembly if new seat
allocation rules favoring the ruling Cambodian People's Party
(CPP) take effect.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec and Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) issued a joint statement
on Thursday rejecting the modified formula for allocation of seats
as "illegal".
</P>
<P>
The statement signed by Funcinpec leader Prince Ranariddh and
Sam Rainsy said the two parties recognized the original formula as
the only legal formula for the allocation of seats.
</P>
<P>
The original formula was laid down during a debate in the
National Assembly and published in full by the National Election
Committee (NEC) in Annex V to its Regulations and Procedures
</P>
<P>
"Last minute attempts to change that formula are illegal. We
will not accept a seat allocation based on the modified formula
that the NEC now presents," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not take part in any session of the National Assembly
attended by alleged members who owe their seats to an illegal
formula at the expense of legally elected Members of the National
Assembly."
</P>
<P>
The NEC announced the preliminary verified results of the
election on Wednesday and the winner, as expected, was the CPP led
by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
According to the NEC's present formula, the CPP is expected to
win 64 seats, while Funcinpec and the SRP will win 43 seats and 15
seats respectively.
</P>
<P>
But under the original formula contained in a May 6 draft of
the NEC regulations, the CPP would win 59 seats, Funcinpec 44, and
SRP 18 while the Khmer Democratic Party would take one.
</P>
<P>
Opposition political parties claimed the revised formula was
biased towards the CPP. They threatened not to recognize the
results until investigations of various allegations were
complete.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban
militia Thursday warned Russia and Uzbekistan not to block its
military advance in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan condemns the statement of
Russia and Uzbekistan and considers this as gross interference in
Afghan domestic affairs," said an official statement issued by the
hard-line militia in Kabul, according to reports monitored here.
</P>
<P>
It accused Russia of backing the northern-based anti-Taliban
alliance and said the northern neighbors had made "irresponsible
assertions."
</P>
<P>
The statement came a day after Russia and Uzbekistan issued a
joint statement in the Uzbek capital after bilateral talks, urging
the Taliban to stop its latest attack on the rival northern
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Uzbekistan have made it clear they would boost
border security to prevent clashes spilling over into Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's supreme leader Mohammad Omar also slammed Russia
and Uzbekistan's joint statement, saying Russian support for the
anti-Taliban forces will lead to "serious consequences", the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Omar said the militia was waging a struggle for peace and
enforcement of Islam and its current offensive in the north was
progressing steadily according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who control two-thirds of Afghanistan, have pushed
to some 100 km of Mazar-e-Sharif, the last bastion of the northern
alliance.

<HEADLINE> EU Helps Redirect Talents of CIS Military Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Science and Technology
Centers set up by the European Union and other countries are
redirecting the talents of former Soviet Union military scientists
to peaceful projects.
</P>
<P>
Lousewies van der Laan, representing the European Commission's
external relations commissioner Hans van den Broek, said on
Thursday that the science and technology centers in Moscow and
Kiev will help Russian and Ukrainian military scientists to lend
their know-how to new ends.
</P>
<P>
The scientists included nuclear, biological and chemical
weaponry experts who had been associated with the research and
development of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European Union also expects to integrate the
talents of Russian and Ukrainian military scientists into the
international scientific community.
</P>
<P>
Since its start in March 1994, the International Science and
Technology Center in Moscow has approved more than 590 projects
with a value of nearly 160 million ECUs (176 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The funds provide support to some 20,000 scientists and
engineers in the Russian Federation and in Armenia, Belarus,
Georgia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow center was set up in line with an international
agreement between the European Union, the United States, Japan and
the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
The Kiev center in Ukraine has, since its inauguration in 1995,
endorsed 133 projects with 17 million ECUs (18.7 million dollars)
of funds which are used to support 2,300 scientists and engineers.
</P>
<P>
The Kiev center was established according to agreements between
the United States, Canada and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has so far provided 62 million ECUs (68.2
million dollars) of funds for 302 of the Moscow center's projects
and three million ECUs (3.3 million dollars) to the Kiev
center.

<HEADLINE> Russian Government Gets Tough on Rail Blockades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Boris Nemtsov said Thursday that state funding will be cut to the
coal industry in regions where striking miners are blocking
railways.
</P>
<P>
"The government will not accept any demands of striking miners
accompanied by railway blockades," Nemtsov told reporters in the
Government House.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that financing would be resumed only after the
re-introduction of public order, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came at a time when many railways are blocked
around the country by striking miners demanding the payment of
back wages.
</P>
<P>
In the Far Eastern region of Sakhalin, a 12-day railway
stoppage pushed the island to the brink of a black-out as the
power station was running out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
As a result, local citizens have endured power cuts of up to
14 hours a day. Sakhalin is not connected to Russia's national
power grid, leaving most of the island's 650,000 residents
dependent on the plant for electricity.
</P>
<P>
A more worrying threat came from the southern Urals region of
Chelyabinsk where coal miners have blocked access to the
Argayashkaya power plant that supplies heat and electricity to
Mayak, Russia's only nuclear waste processing plant.
</P>
<P>
Workers of the civil defense service have been dispatched to
the site amid fears that electronic safety systems might break
down.
</P>
<P>
Miners across Russia rocked the government in May when they
blocked key railway lines such as the Trans-Siberian in a protest
that cost the Railways Ministry an estimated 355 million rubles
(57 million U.S. dollars) in lost freight.

<HEADLINE> "Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew" Due to Be Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singapore, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Three well-known publishing
groups announced here Thursday that they have agreed to jointly
publish the memoirs of Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
who himself put his life experience into words.
</P>
<P>
The publishing groups are the Publishing Singapore Press
Holdings (SPH) and Times, that will publish the book for the
Singapore and Malaysian markets, and the Simon &AMP; Schuster Asia,
which will publish the book for the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
A news release from the SPH said, "From 1995, it took Mr. Lee
three years to put into words his 75 years of life experience,
especially his political experience in the last 45 years to
produce the memoirs of more than one million words."
</P>
<P>
The news release said, "The memoirs, which will come in two
separate volumes, the first dealing with the author's early years
up to Singapore Independence and the second with his life from
then to the present day, provides a vivid account of the making of
Singapore as well as a fascinating insight into the man who
transformed Singapore and shape its history."
</P>
<P>
Simon &AMP; Schuster Asia Publishing Director Stephen Troth said,
"This is an important book for us written by one of the region's
foremost political thinkers. During this time of political and
economic upheaval in Asia, we feel a reflective book of this sort
will be of great interest. The author's views are already well
known and respected in Asia but we feel that they will also be of
interest to wider audience outside."
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the first volume, titled "The
Singapore Story: Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew", will be published to
coincide with the author's 75th birthday on September 16.
</P>
<P>
The Memoirs will be published both in English and Chinese. The
First volume of the Chinese version, which was translated by a
team of Lianhe Zaobao journalists and writers who worked closely
with Lee to carry out the translation and editing work
simultaneously, will come out at the same time with the English
version.
</P>
<P>
The SPH news release said, "In it, Mr. Lee gives a vivid
description and recollection of his years of growing up, political
struggles, and experience in nation building."
</P>
<P>
"There are many interesting inside stories and invaluable
historical facts which he is making known for the first time," it
added.
</P>
<P>
It also said that "the second volume is scheduled to be
published next year. Here Mr. Lee would discuss the
post-independence days, the problems he encountered in developing
the society, education, defense, economy and infrastructure and
how he came up with various policies to overcome them."
</P>
<P>
"He would also dwell on how he opened up Singapore to forge
ties with its neighbors and the world in the last 40 years and
what he has learnt from the success and failure of other
countries," it added.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kuan Yew, born in 1923, became Singapore's first prime
minister in 1959 when Singapore achieved self-government and he
was 35 years of age. He continued to be the prime minister after
the country's independence and served on for 31 years before he
left the post in 1990 to become senior minister of the Cabinet.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A three-man South African
ministerial delegation headed by Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo will
travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R.Congo) Friday
morning for talks with embattled President Laurent Kabila in his
Lubumbashi stronghold.
</P>
<P>
"We're not carrying solutions... we're interested in getting
the view of the government. If they need us to do anything, we'll
discuss it," South African Press Association Thursday quoted Nzo
as saying in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
He would be accompanied by Defense Minister Joe Modise and
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi.
</P>
<P>
The one-day visit follows talks earlier this week between
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Kabila, after
uprisings in the country against his rule.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters whether he would also be willing at some
stage to meet the rebels, headed by veteran politician Arthur
Zahidi Ngoma, Nzo said: "We will be very ready to meet anybody to
have that situation resolved."
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation in the D.R.Congo as "critical", Nzo
said the South African delegation would be very happy to receive
a briefing from Kabila on the developments in his country.
</P>
<P>
Replying on whether outside military intervention might be
necessary, Nzo said: "Why are you so war-like? We are a peaceful
people, we are for a diplomatic solution all the time."
</P>
<P>
Banyamulenge soldiers who helped Kabila to oust Mobutu Sese
Seko last year rebelled against Kabila last Sunday after they
were ordered to go home.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela was trying to rally neighboring heads of state to
deal with disturbing developments in Lesotho following its May
general election, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The South African government had already been in contact with
Zimbabwe and Botswana on Lesotho, South African Press Association
quoted Nzo as saying at a media briefing.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Lesotho riot police were deployed at the Lesotho
parliament in Maseru to maintain law and order as crowds of
opposition protesters gathered outside the parliament gate.
</P>
<P>
The gathering prevented both houses of parliament to meet at
the scheduled time.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, all supporters of the three main opposition
parties - the Basotholand Congress Party, the Basotho National
Party and the Marematlou Freedom Party - were protesting against
the outcome of the May 29 general election.
</P>
<P>
They said the polls were rigged and the results, a landslide
victory for the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD),
should be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
The angry mob, armed with heavy sticks, shouted
anti-government slogans and sang battle songs. Some stood face to
face with riot police fully armed with riot gear, batons, shields
and tear gas equipment.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and his
cabinet were held hostage inside parliament by the protesters for
an hour after Mosisili addressed parliament on the present
political situation in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The three main opposition parties staged a march Tuesday to
present a petition to King Letsie III, asking him to intervene in
the matter.

BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is planning on reducing
sulphur and smoke emissions by keeping coal that fails to meet
low-sulphur criteria off the market, according to Vice-Mayor Liu
Haiyan.
</P>
<P>
Liu told a meeting of 200 officials in charge of coal
purchasing today that this is Beijing's first ruling of its
kind. It says that coal used for heating in winter can contain no
more than 5 parts sulphur per thousand.
</P>
<P>
Like most of Chinese cities, Beijing relies on coal for its
main energy source and burns 27 million tons of it each year, with
5 million tons of that for heating purposes from November to March.
</P>
<P>
Yu Xiaoxuan, deputy director of the Beijing Environmental
Protection Bureau, said that the amount of sulphur dioxide in the
air was higher than state limits three times and caused
respiratory problems for many residents.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is now one of the most seriously polluted cities in
China. Its main pollutants are smoke from coal, motor vehicle
exhaust emissions, and dust from various sources.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting of officials it was pointed out that the use of
low-sulphur coal will reduce sulphur dioxide and soot emissions by
about 70,000 tons each in the wintertime.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI) will take concrete measures to protect national economic
activities from criminal acts like looting and theft, ABRI Chief
Gen. Wiranto said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"ABRI will address security problems that disturb the
government's efforts to improve the economy," Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
After attending a limited coordination meeting on economic,
financial and industrial affairs here, Wiranto said criminal acts
in the economic field had increased in frequency lately and ABRI
therefore needed to step up its efforts to fight them.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah told reporters that the
criminal acts might well have been masterminded by certain
quarters.
</P>
<P>
To find out who were behind the criminal acts, including the
looting that occurred in different parts of the country recently,
intelligence operations had to be carried out, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yosfiah said that Forestry and Plantations Minister Muslimin
Nasution had reported that lawless acts such as looting had also
occurred in the forestry sector.
</P>
<P>
One state-owned forestry company in East Java province had lost
13,600 teak trees due to theft or looting.
</P>
<P>
Instances of forest tree theft also happened in South
Banyuwangi, Probolinggo and Jatirogo, all in East Java province.

NEW DELHI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Rabbani government in
Afghan urged India and other countries in the region to exert
pressure on Pakistan to stop its "adventurist" designs against it.
</P>
<P>
Afghan Ambassador to India Masood Khalili asked India and other
friendly countries Thursday to strongly condemn Pakistan for using
its Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) to prop up the Taliban
forces in his country.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference here Thursday, Khalili called on the
United Nations to intervene to ensure lasting and durable peace in
the war-torn country.

<P>
Khalili claimed that the ISI was also using Afghanistan as a
springboard for its activities in Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
India, which he said supports a political solution to the
Afghan conflicts with the installation of a broad-based
government, should take a leading role in mobilizing world opinion
against Islamabad.

<P>
The ambassador said that the Rabbani government was ready to

<HEADLINE> Enterprises Urged to Emulate Model Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, has called on enterprises across the nation to
emulate 14 highly successful ventures in order to overcome
existing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
A commentary in today's edition said that Chinese people have
proceeded under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and
the State Council to successfully address the difficult
international environment by working together to overcome the
adverse effects of the Asian financial crisis and achieve a growth
rate of seven percent in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Related achievements show that "facing difficulties in a
straight forward manner...and firmly implementing the correct
decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council
will enable us to grasp opportunities, overcome hardships and
achieve development," according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
It added that the success of the 14 enterprises recognized by
the State Council serves as best proof that enterprises have
garnered achievements even in a difficult market situation.
</P>
<P>
The commentary warns that difficult tasks remains along the
road to progress and calls for greater efforts to achieve this
year's targeted economic growth rate of eight percent. It also
calls for maintaining an open mind with regard to the long-term
and indepth influences of the Asian financial crisis and lingering
domestic problems related to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the commentary points out that major decisions and
measures adopted by the central authorities are playing a positive
role and the overall economy has taken a turn for the better.
</P>
<P>
The commentary urges enterprises to follow the examples set by
the 14 models, abandon any fear of difficulties and deepen reform
by expanding markets and improving management.
</P>
<P>
It also calls on local governments and departments to
faithfully implement State Council plans for economic development
during the latter half of the year, and voiced confidence in the
fact that "we will undoubtedly achieve this year's goal with
concerted efforts carried out under the leadership of the Party
Central Committee with General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the core."

<HEADLINE> HK Official: Good Parents-Children Relations Help Deter Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Administrative Secretary Anson
Chan of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Thursday
called on parents and children to deter juvenile crime hand in
hand by communicating with and caring for each other.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the Junior Police Call (JPC) Summer Camp at
Wu Kwai Sha Youth Village in Ma On Shan, Chan told JPC members
that many youngsters committed crime because of family problems
and poor relationship with their parents.
</P>
<P>
"You must realize that your family is your pillar of support.
When you come across problems, you should discuss them with your
parents and family members and seek their advice," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
She asked parents to help their children solve problems in a
caring and open attitude. Moreover, they should set an example for
their children to help them foster proper values of life and grow
up as good citizens, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Running from August 4 to 7, this year's camp attracted more
than 1,500 JPC members. It has adopted the theme of this year's
Fight Crime Publicity Campaign "Your Children's Future Hangs on
Parental Care".
</P>
<P>
Since its inception in 1974, the JPC scheme has grown into the
largest youth organization in Hong Kong with nearly 210,000
youngsters on its membership roll.
</P>
<P>
Chan highly commended the JPC members for their contributions
in community services and for helping the police fight against
crime.

<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, State Council, and Central Military
Commission, sent telegrams of appreciation today to millions of
Chinese soldiers and civilians participating the flood control
effort.
</P>
<P>
Central authorities praised the leading and crucial role CPC
committees and governments at all levels have played in organizing
military and civilians to participate in the massive effort to
battle the heaviest flooding since 1954. The telegram of
appreciation noted that participants have contributed greatly to
national economic development and social stability by "battling
successive flood crests, ensuring the integrity of major rivers
and lakes, and protecting reservoirs, cities and transportation
arteries, as well as people in affected areas."
</P>
<P>
Telegrams were sent to Party committees and governments in all
provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities and military command
areas, as well as general departments under the Central Military
Commission and Party committees for all branchs of the military.
</P>
<P>
The fact that both Chinese citizens and the army have weathered
the arduous tests of flood control clearly show they can overcome
all difficulties or obstacles under the leadership of the CPC,
according to the telegrams.
</P>
<P>
Flood control has reached a critical stage and central
authorities called on Party committees and governments at all
levels to continue to organize and mobilize soliders and civilians
in a joint effort to win a final victory against flooding.

<HEADLINE> Rights of Ethnic Chinese in Indonesia Should Be Respected: Wu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China has urged the Indonesian
government to protect the rights and interests of ethnic Chinese
in Indonesia after they were targeted by rioters in May.
</P>
<P>
China was deeply concerned about the plight of the ethnic
Chinese and was urging the Indonesian government to punish the
culprits severely, said a Chinese diplomat Thursday at a
United Nations Meeting here on human rights.
</P>
<P>
Repeated representations had been made to the Indonesian
government through diplomatic channels to that effect, said
Wu Jianmin, Permanent Representative of the Permanent Mission of
the People's Republic of China to the United Nations office in
Geneva and to other International Organizations in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government had asked the Indonesian government to
"take effective measures to safeguard the personal safety and
legitimate rights and interests of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia,
and prevent the occurrence of similar incidents", said the
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
During the riots which took place in some cities in Indonesia
in May, many shops owned by ethnic Chinese were ransacked and
burned and many ethnic Chinese women were savagely raped.
</P>
<P>
The atrocities have sparked grave concern and indignation of
the Chinese people and Chinese associations abroad, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that Indonesian President B.J. Habibie labeled
it 'the most inhuman event in the history of the nation' and
ordered a special investigation committee to be set up," Wu said
at the sub-commission on the prevention of discrimination and
protection of minorities of the UN Human Rights Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas also
called the incidents "the shame of Indonesia".

<HEADLINE> France Urges Iraq to Resume Cooperation with UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday urged Iraq to
resume cooperation with both the United Nations Special Commission
on disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA).
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry described Wednesday's decision by
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM
and the IAEA as "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
"France recalls its attachment to the letter and spirit of the
agreement of February 23, 1998, between the United Nations and
Iraq," said a Foreign Ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in Baghdad, averted an air
strike by the United States and Britain on suspected chemical and
biological weapons targets in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
France had greatly contributed to the signing of this agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The special commission and the IAEA which have completed a
better part of the disarmament program of Iraq should be in the
place to achieve their mission, in the perspective of a lifting of
the sanctions and the full re-integration of Iraq in the
international community," said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi decision to freeze cooperation with UNSCOM and the
IAEA was made after the latest round of talks between UNSCOM
Chairman Richard Butler and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
broke down Monday night.

BRUSSELS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on

million U.S. dollars) for victims of the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The aid, to be managed by the European Community Humanitarian
Office, will enable the United Nations and non-governmental
organizations to carry out emergency programs for those fleeing

</P>
<P>
The priorities for aid agencies are food, health care,
sanitation, shelter and materials needed by those affected by
wintry weather.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said the conflict in Kosovo had escalated
dramatically in the summer months, and the number of displaced
people fleeing to Albania is now estimated at 13,000, with 27,000
taking refuge in Montenegro and 2,000 in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The number of displaced people still in Kosovo was estimated at

<HEADLINE> South African Opposition Parties Fail to Unite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Talks between South
Africa's various opposition parties have failed to bring about
unity, and the parties will each go it alone in next year's
general election,
</P>
<P>
The National Party (NP) and the Democratic Party (DP) are set
on a collision course, with each determined to be the official
opposition in the new parliament, and neither able to guess at
the strength of the United Democratic Movement (UDM), The Citizen
daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We sent the Nats (National Party) our set of proposals, and
there was a stony silence," DP leader Tony Leon said at day-long
briefings by opposition leaders to ambassadors and journalists at
parliament in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Leon said there was still possible cooperation with others to
ensure that opposition groups were equitably treated in the
election process, including coverage on television.
</P>
<P>
It was also possible that in some provinces there would be a
need for cooperation between parties after the election.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond that, the Democratic Party will certainly fight the
election under its own colors," said Leon.
</P>
<P>
The NP had been the official opposition since 1994, but recent
opinion polls showed that it was losing support. With only a year
to go before the 1999 elections it was unlikely that the NP would
turn the tide of unfavorable public opinion.
</P>
<P>
"The trend away from the NP in recent by-elections is so
pronounced that the party is likely to lose its status as the
official opposition in 1999. The DP is in a position to become
the official opposition," said Leon.
</P>
<P>
Leon said he believed the UDM was unlikely to gain much
support outside the Eastern Cape province.
</P>
<P>
The naming of former warlord Sifiso Nkabinde as the UDM's
general secretary would harm it at the poll, he said.
</P>
<P>
NP leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk described contact between
the parties, aimed at possible election cooperation, as
"disappointing".
</P>
<P>
However, the NP was determined to retain control of the
Western Cape and win the Northern Cape in next year's election.
The national goal was to prevent a two-thirds majority for the
ruling African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
Van Schalkwyk believed that no party would be able to garner
50 percent of the votes in KwaZulu-Natal, making a post-election
coalition almost certain.
</P>
<P>
He said the NP was still in favor of some kind of cooperation
between like-minded parties, but the kind of cooperation it
wanted did not seem to be attainable.
</P>
<P>
"It will be difficult to do it before the election, but I have
always said we can do it after the election," van Schalkwyk said.
</P>
<P>
Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen said he was also in
favor of cooperation between different opposition parties in an
effort to prevent a two-thirds majority for the ANC.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that in the proportional voting system it is
possible to cooperate with other parties in achieving this,
without losing your identity as a political party or being forced
to use one candidate's list," said Viljoen.
</P>
<P>
Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) leader Stanley Mogoba said the
PAC had built up a presence in all nine provinces with
"phenomenal" growth in North-West, Northern Province, Eastern
Cape, Gauteng and Free State.
</P>
<P>
"Our experience throughout is that our policy enjoys wide
acceptance," Mogoba said.
</P>
<P>
African Christian Democratic Party leader Kenneth Meshoe, who
heads the smallest of the opposition parties in parliament, also
forecast gains for his party in the elections.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Price Slump Hits North Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The price slump of Burley tobacco
on the international markets has hit the major planter, the
northern Nampula Province of Mozambique, according to the local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The provincial bureau of agriculture and fishery disclosed
recently that one kilogram of Class A Burley tobacco, which could
be sold for 13,000 Metical (12,000 Metical equals one U.S.
Dollar) last year, is sold for only 12,000 Metical now.
</P>
<P>
The officials pointed out that the falling purchase prices of
the tobacco has angered the farmers who said that it is unfair
for them to suffer the loss.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco prices for the classes of B and C per kilogram
also decreased by 1,000 Metical each. One kilogram of Class D
Burley tobacco is now sold for 6,000 Metical while the price for

smuggle their produce to the neighboring countries for better
prices.

<P>
Last year, more than 500 tons of tobacco leaf was smuggled
from the provinces of Niassa and Zambezia to Malawi, causing a
loss of eight billion Metical to Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> PNA Denies Arrests Linked to Settlers Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) denied Thursday that the recent arrests by
Palestinian police in the West Bank were linked to the killing of
two Jewish settlers, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted an unnamed senior PNA official as saying that
the arrests made in the Palestinian villages near the West Bank
town of Nablus had nothing to do with the shooting of two Jewish
settlers late Tuesday night in Itzhar, a settlement near Nablus.
</P>
<P>
He said the arrests were carried out only as general
preventative security measures.
</P>
<P>
In earlier reports, the radio said Palestinian police had
aided the Israeli army in a search for the killers, arresting
several residents of Nablus Wednesday night as suspects.
</P>
<P>
Israel has expressed its dissatisfaction over the lack of a
public denouncement from PNA President Yasser Arafat of the
killing.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat's adviser Ahmed Tibi explained that although the PNA
deplores such violence, it distinguishes between Israeli citizens
and settlers at Itzhar and other settlements, who are opposed to
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Tibi charged the settlers for working against the
self-determination by the Palestinian people, saying there was no
point for any comment from Arafat over the attack incident.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during a condolence visit to the families of the
two slain settlers, Israeli President Ezer Weizman expressed
support for the continuation of the peace talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But the outspoken president, who has been pressing hard-line
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue the peace process,
was also dissatisfied with the Palestinian response to the
killing, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the shooting incident, Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators are reportedly to resume contacts later Thursday to
set up another negotiating session in a continued effort to clinch
a deal on the overdue Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that he thought an agreement on the second
pullback could be reached shortly, but Tuesday's attack
underscored the need to make security arrangment in any deal with
the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Peace Deal Sealed Between Local Factions in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic fundamentalist
group of Al-Itihad Al-Islam and the Somali National Front (SNF)
faction of General Omar Haji Masalle have reached a peace deal
after a 20-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two sides Wednesday concluded the final six-point deal in
the El-Adde village of the border region Gedo.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the two sides, Ali Mohamed Mukhtar (deputy
chairman of the SNF faction) and Sheikh Mohamud Moallim Nur
(deputy chairman of Al-Itihad), told reporters via VHF radio in
Mogadishu Wednesday that this agreement is historic and decisive.
</P>
<P>
The agreed points include the cessation of hostilities, paving
the way for co-existence and the creation of a peaceful
environment for demining all roads for the commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
Each of the two sides had earlier mined all roads leading to
the strongholds of the opposite side as part of an easy defensive
tactic used throughout Somalia since the breakout of the civil
war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The deal also includes the use of SNF as the political emblem
for the region and the reimposition of the Islamic Sharia laws.
</P>
<P>
Another important item in the agreement is that the peaceful
co-existence with the neighboring countries and that a high-level
mission be sent to these countries.
</P>
<P>
This would mean particularly the end of hostilities with
Ethiopia. Al-Itihad Al-Islam had long been accused of
instigating bombing raids in many parts inside Ethiopia,
including the capital city of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
In an alleged pursuit of Al-Itihad, the Ethiopian forces had
crossed into Somalia in two large military incursions in Gedo
region in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also called for the restructuring of SNF with
Al-Itihad in another meeting to be held in the capital of the
region, Garbaharrey.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal between SNF and Al-Itihad Al-Islam can be
characterized as a positive step forward, considering the peace
process throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, a controversial administration had been
announced in the northeastern regions while another similar one
was announced here in Mogadishu four days ago.
</P>
<P>
All these movements show tentative peace-making efforts after
almost eight years of anarchy in Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Expands National Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has expanded the
Katavi National Park in the western region of Rukwa to provide
more areas for wild animals there.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the extended park on Wednesday, President
Benjamin Mkapa said the wildlife should be protected not only for
the benefit of Tanzania but for the whole world.
</P>
<P>
The German government has granted over four billion Shillings
(about 5.97 million U.S. Dollars) for Katavi Park expansion while
Tanzania has raised 27.4 million Shillings for it, the Daily News
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The park, one of the 12 national parks in the east African
country, was first set up by the government in 1974 with an area
of 2,253 square kilometers. It has been expanded to 4,471 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The park, characterized by Miombo Woodland and water-logged
plains, is famous for Sable and Roan antelopes which are rarely
found in other parks in the country. It also has a high
population density of crocodiles, water bucks, hartbeest and
Greater Kudu among other large mammals.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Tanzanian National Parks (TANAPA) acting
Director-General said the expansion of the park will provide a
larger area, including mountains in the north, for the migration
of animals.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa also appealed to the international donors to
complement the Tanzanian government's efforts in wildlife
conservation.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Total Sees Modest Rise in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Germany registered a
modest rise of 59,400 to a total of 4,134,500 in July, about
220,000 less than in the same month of last year, the German
Federal Labour Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate rose to 10.7 percent from 10.5 percent in
June, less than the 11.4 percent for June last year, the latest
figures showed.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Leven, deputy president of the labor office, attributed
the increase in the June jobless total entirely to seasonal
factors, adding that the rise was significantly less than in the
previous years.
</P>
<P>
"The current economic upswing in Germany is giving a gradual
boost to the job market," Leven said.
</P>
<P>
German Labor Minister Norbert Bluem also saw in the June data
a confirmation of the government assessment that a trend of
reversal is setting in on the job market.
</P>
<P>
"We are making progress step by step in the battle against
unemployment," he said.

<HEADLINE> SKorea's Foreign Debts Down to 153.8 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign debt fell to
153.8 billion U.S. dollars at the end of June, down 1.2 billion
dollars from a month earlier, the Ministry of Finance and Economy
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In June, long-term liabilities rose 900 million dollars
due to the inflow of funds from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) while short-term ones fell 2.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of short-term debts declined from 26.1 percent
in May to 24.9 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
However, debts which should be repaid by the public sector
expanded to 30.7 billion U.S. dollars late in the month.
</P>
<P>
Domestic financial institutions' short-term debts dropped by
1.3 billion dollars to 69.6 billion in June from May while the
long-term ones fell by 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the private sector's external debts edged down 100
million to 37.8 billion dollars in June despite a fresh commercial
loan of 260 million.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the nation's foreign debt grew
by 12.6 billion dollars in the public sector, but declined 5.6
billion and 4.4 billion respectively in financial and private
business sectors.
</P>
<P>
South Korea borrowed 58 billion dollars from the IMF last
December after it was gripped by a financial crisis caused by
corporate failures and bad loans of financial institutions late
last year.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- In a sign indicating the
growing discontent with failure to tackle corruption within the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), a second minister in the new
PNA cabinet announced resignation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Jawad Saleh, a newly appointed minister without portfolio
in the PNA cabinet, announced his decision at a news conference in
the West Bank city Ramallah to follow up the step of Minister of
Tourism and Archaeology Hanan Ashrawi.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi announced her resignation at an earlier news conference
in Ramallah in protest against the lack of comprehensive reform in
the cabinet reshuffle made by PNA President Yasser Arafat on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the new lineup of the cabinet, all ministers
accused of being corrupt in the previous cabinet retained their
jobs despite that it was the accusation of corruption and
inefficiency that led to the latest cabinet shakeup by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said he was not satisfied with the cabinet reshuffle
announced by Arafat on Wednesday and decided to leave the new
government.
</P>
<P>
Saleh, an independent member of the Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) elected from Biret, near Ramallah, was minister of
agriculture in the former cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Arafat presented Wednesday his new cabinet to the PLC which has
decided to vote on the reshuffle on Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has earned about 342
billion Meticais (28.5 million U.S. Dollars) from the transfer of
fixed assets including housing, commercial and industrial real
estate since the transfer process started in 1993.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Joaquim Mauricio, director of the Central
Commission of Fixed Assets Appraisal and Transfer of Mozambique,
at a meeting on the transfer of fixed assets held in the Maputo
suburbs Wednesday, the Noticias newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Mauricio, 63 percent of the country's 56,770 real
estate has been applied for transfer, of which 54 percent has
been approved.
</P>
<P>
Twenty percent of the income from the transfer of fixed assets
are to be handed over to the coffer, 30 percent allocated for the
Housing Fund, and the rest goes to the original owner for refund.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's Fixed Assets Act, one (national citizen)
may pay cash or instalments while buying the house he or she is
residing. However, the installments should be in less than 25
years.
</P>
<P>
Mauricio said the government will simplify procedures to speed
up the process of real estate transfer.
</P>
<P>
Most of the existing state-owned fixed assets came from early
independence when state-ownership was initiated.

ISLAMABAD, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister

</P>
<P>
According to a report of the official Associated Press of
Pakistan (APP) Thursday, Gohar said in an interview that Pakistani
forces have just made their target the areas under the Indian
military control but avoided attempting harm to the districts
inhabited by the civilian populations.

The foreign minister also blamed Indian for the unsuccessful
talks held in Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka, last week between
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart
Atal Behari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
India, he said, in fact avoided to hold talks on the issue of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
He repeated his call for a third party to mediate on the issue
of Kashmir between the two sides if genuine progress is required
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, Pakistani and Indian forces have been
locked in heavy shelling along the Line of Control separating the
disputed Kashmir, killing over 100 civilians at the both sides.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Test slips will be handed
Thursday to more than 134,000 local Secondary Five (Form Five)
graduates who sat for the Hong Kong Certificate for Education
Examination (HKCEC).
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong Examinations Authority, improvements
were shown in the overall performance of the students this year.
</P>
<P>
The authority said 62.4 percent of them got a pass in all
subjects taken, a mere 0.6 percentage points higher than last
year's 61.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
While there are about 24,200 Secondary Six places available,
only 20,729 candidates, or 23.8 percent, achieved 14 points or
more in their best six subjects, the minimum entry requirement to
Secondary Six places.
</P>
<P>
Result slips, showing the points students received in the best
six papers, will be distributed to school candidates Thursday
through their schools or mailed to private candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department of the Special Administrative Region has

"I hope you will not be despondent. Failure is the only high
road to success. To fail once does not mean that this is the end
of everything," Tung said.

inaccurate definition of a Filipina as a housemaid is "totally
unacceptable" and an affront to the dignity of Filipino women.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to point out that this definition is severely
inaccurate and lacking in academic research. As much as it is
offensive, its negative connotation downgrades the positive
contribution of Filipino women to the economic and social
development of the Philippines and of Greece," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada stressed that the error should be corrected as soon as
possible "in view of the cordial relations between the Philippines
and Greece."
</P>
<P>
The dictionary was authored by a certain George Babiniotis.
</P>
<P>
The president said Filipino women have distinguished themselves
not only at home but also in the international community.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Filipinas have occupied not only high
positions in Congress but the presidency of the Philippines as
well, adding they have also been recognized as leaders in the
academics and business.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore an affront to the dignity and person of the
Filipino woman to confine her description within the limited
definition of a domestic helper. Mr. Babiniotis' definition is
totally unacceptable and not based on fact," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada asked the Greek government to call Babiniotis'
attention to the serious error so that the author could
immediately make necessary correction.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Ambassador to Greece Norberto Basilio earlier filed
an official protest before the Greek government questioning the
inaccurate definition.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has at least 6.5 million contract workers in
more than 100 countries and regions around the world. Most of the
workers are female.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Expects New Cabinet Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A new cabinet is expected to
emerge in Nigeria, as the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) and
the National Council of States (NCS) hold a joint meeting in
capital Abuja Thursday.
</P>
<P>
PRC is the now Nigeria's highest ruling body, comprising of
major military leaders, while the NCS is comprised of military
administrators of all states.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said the meeting will also decide the
composition of a new independent electoral commission that will
monitor all elections under the new transition to civil rule
program.
</P>
<P>
General Abdulsalam Abubakar, assuming office on June 9
following the sudden death of late military leader General Sani
Abacha, sacked the cabinet he heritaged on July 8.
</P>
<P>
On July 20, he sacked all the political parties as well as the
national electoral commission on the basis that the transition
program under General Abacha has no credibility due to massive
rigging.
</P>
<P>
He, however, refused the opposition's demand for a government
of national unity, promising that new cabinet will be able to
reflect the interest of various groups.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar also announced a new transition program that will see
the military handing over to an elected civilian government on May
29, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Militant Attacks Decline in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Attacks by Islamic militants in
Egypt have sharply decreased in the first seven months of this
year as a result of tough crackdown by the police, the Al Ahram
weekly reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The English-language edition quoted security sources as saying
that the security forces have reduced the operations of the
militants by 85 percent in southern Egypt and completely cut off
their sources of financing and armament.
</P>
<P>
The number of victims killed in terrorist acts has also dropped
significantly, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Nine civilians and six policemen were killed in the first
seven months of 1998 compared with 50 civilians and 44 policemen
in the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The sources attributed the decline to a multi-prong security
strategy worked out by the Interior Ministry after the Luxor
massacrer last November, in which 58 foreign tourists were killed.
</P>
<P>
Security forces have since launched raids against militants'
hide-outs in southern provinces of Minya, Assuit and Qena, killing
16 militants.
</P>
<P>
As part of the new strategy, the police force is changing its
infamous and often boomerang heavy-handedness, which has led to
haphazard arrests and massive sentences.
</P>
<P>
During the past seven months, 2,500 people, who were detained
without charge on suspicion of links with Islamic militant groups
and proven innocent, have been released.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry is continuing the policy of organizing
discussions between Islamic scholars and detainees with the aim of
"correcting their misconceptions."
</P>
<P>
Nearly 5,000 detainees have repented after the correction
sessions and decided to renounce the ideology of Al Gamaa Al
Islamiya, Egypt's largest Islamic militant group.
</P>
<P>
Anti-government Islamic militants have been fighting to
overthrow the secular government led by President Hosni Mubarak in
order to establish an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
The armed militants often target foreign tourists in an attempt
to hurt the country's tourism, the leading earner of foreign
exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Consultancy Agreement signed for West African Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A consultancy agreement for the
feasibility study on the West African Gas Pipeline Project has
been signed between Pipeline Engineering of Germany and a
consortium of four multi-national companies.
</P>
<P>
The Punch newspaper reported Thursday that the study would be
ready in the first quarter of 1999 at a cost of two million U.S.
Dollars and would entail technical and commercial analysis of the
conditions required to implement the project.
</P>
<P>
The consortium comprises Chevron Nigeria Ltd., Nigeria Gas
Company (NGC), Shell Petroleum Development Company, Ghana
National Petroleum Corporation and Societe Beniniose de Gaz S.A..
</P>
<P>
NGC General Manager Jackson Gaius-Obaseki was quoted as saying
Wednesday that through the gas pipeline project, the abundant
resources of natural gas in Nigeria can be used to satisfy the
energy requirements of the sub-region of west Africa.
</P>
<P>
The concept of the West African Gas Pipeline Project was
predicated on the need to meet the energy requirements of the
sub-region through the transmission of natural gas from Nigeria
to Benin, Togo and Ghana for power generation and other uses, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The idea of a sub-regional gas pipeline was first
conceptualized when the petroleum and energy ministers of the
four countries signed an agreement on the proposed project in
September 1995.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, a group of four companies including
U!Yd=91+ R-Xna National Petroleum Corporation and the
Nigerian Gas Company inaugurated a private sector initiative in
order to accelerate the project implementation through a joint
preparation of a detailed, feasibility study.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has abundant natural gas resources which is estimated
at between 15 trillion and 30 trillion cubic feet.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt. Not Overborrowing: Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 6 (Xinhua) --Zimbabwean Deputy Finance Minister
Misheck Chinamasa has denied the government was overborrowing
from foreign sources, noting that most of the government
expenditure was raised from tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Chinamasa made the remarks Wednesday while responding to
issues from members of parliament (MPs) attempting to refuse
the ratification of some loan agreements.
</P>
<P>
"The debt service ratio is less than 20 percent," Chinamasa
said. "The recommended debt service ratio is 30 percent which
means that my ministry has been very cautious in its borrowings."
</P>
<P>
He said the MPs should not make conditions, or hold new loans
to ransom in view of the previous loans.
</P>
<P>
A loan of 318 million Zimbabwean Dollars (16 million U.S.
Dollars) which the MPs refused to ratify had been catered for
during the last budget announced last year and was indicated as
net foreign borrowing, said the deputy minister.
</P>
<P>
It contributed to less than one percent as most of the
government's expenditure was raised from tax revenue, he said. It
was not true that the government was overborrowing from foreign
sources, he added.
</P>
<P>
The house, however, for the second day running refused to
ratify the loans.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government's total external debt by June 30
last year stood at 28.9 billion Zimbabwean Dollars (about 1.5
billion U.S. Dollars), the Zimbabwe News Agency Thursday quoted
the deputy minister as saying.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Urged to Curb Thalassemia Disease in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian experts have urged the
government to make more efforts to curb the spread of thalassemia
disease, which affected 12 percent of the kingdom's 4 million
population, the Jordan Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This is an alarming issue that should be taken seriously,"
said Nayef Gharaybeh, director of the Health Center at the
University of Science and Technology, who has been conducting
study on thalassemia for years.
</P>
<P>
Patients of this disease, common in Mediterranean countries,
suffer from hemolytic anemia due to the destruction of the red
blood cells. They are sick and pale and obsessed with enlarged
spleens and delayed growth.
</P>
<P>
Gharaybeh found that the disease's inheritability, intertwined
with the popular consanguineous marriage in Jordan, contributed to
the current situation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the often case is that not a single member, but
many members in one family are thalamessia carriers.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health and Medical Care spends an average of 3
million Jordanian dinars (about 4.2 million U.S. dollars) each
year on treating some 1,000 patients who visited hospitals for
treatment of thalamessia.
</P>
<P>
Individual carriers of thalamessia are relatively healthy, but
when they become parents there is 25 percent possibility that any
child they have will inherit this disease, said Gharaybeh.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa Al Falah, a haematologist at the state-run Al Bashir
Hospital, told the Jordan Times that a thalamessia child becomes
anaemic at between three and 18 months of age. If they are not
treated, they usually die.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has been advocating pre-marital tests
in order to prevent the spread of thalamessia and other
genetically-transmitted diseases, but the effect was limited.
</P>
<P>
Would-be couples usually hesitate to accept such tests, because
of social taboos and the fear that the tests could expose
infertility-related problems that might scuttle their marriage
plans.

ISLAMABAD, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Thursday said his government is committed to the education
of girl child despite the country's financial hardship.
</P>
<P>
"Despite financial hardships, the government has allocated 4
percent of the Gross National Product (GNP) during the current
fiscal year to the education sector," Sharif told a foundation
stone-laying ceremony of the first women university in the country
Thursday in Rawalpindi, about 20 km south of here.
</P>
<P>
"This is double the amount specified during last fiscal year,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government, instead of having an "eye on the
national exchequer, is committed to spending the money on the
education of girl child.
</P>
<P>
The first women university has been named after illustrious
sister of the father of the nation and will be known as "Fatima
Jinnah Women University", he said, adding it will accommodate
about 4,000 women students.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that he specially instructed the
authorities to specify 10 percent quota for those girls who could
not afford to continue their studies.
</P>
<P>
"These 400 girl students will be given scholarships and all
their expenses will be met by the government," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's official literacy rate is about 30 percent and is
one of the lowest in the world. The literacy rate of the women

<P>
HONG KONG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks fell sharply
on Thursday to finish at a three-year-odd low, as the market was
feeling the pinch of higher interbank rates and a weaker Japanese
yen.
</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng Index fell 212.07 points, or 2.84 percent, to
close at 7,254.36, the lowest since January 25, 1995, when the

recovery on the Wall Street but soon lost steam. At the morning
close, the index slipped 112.60 points, or 1.51 percent to

</P>
<P>
The fall came as interbank rates went up over fears of another
round of speculative attacks on the local currency, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
A weaker Japanese yen and a poor earnings report made by
conglomerate Swire Pacific also drove the market down.
</P>

Swire Pacific, one of the 33 constituent stocks of the Hang
Seng Index, reported Wednesday a 39 percent decline in profits for

<P>
HAICHENG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Police in the northeast China
province of Liaoning have arrested a Liaoning man, Zhang Shifeng,
who is suspected of being involved in the death of Lin Ti-chuan, a
Taiwanese woman who was killed while on a business trip to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was apprehended at about 11 a.m. this morning on a train
going from Yantai in east China's Shangdong Province to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Another suspect in the case, Huang Shidong, a farmer from the
city of Haicheng, was caught in Mulan County in Heilongjiang
Province on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
So far police have ascertained that the kidnapping of the woman
was plotted by a Haicheng businessman, Li Guangzhi, and was
carried out by by Huang, Zhang, and two other men, Yang Rongxi and
Zhao Chuang.
</P>
<P>
Huang has confessed during an interrogation that he and the
others abducted Lin Ti-chuan and a Taiwanese businessman named Wei
Tien-kang, and took them to an empty room in the Haicheng
Development Zone on the evening of July 27, soon after their
arrival in the port city of Dalian in Liaoning. The motive was an
attempt to force Wei to return some money that he owed Li.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Intensify Food Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will implement
measures to boost food production with a view to reducing the
nation's trade deficit, its Agriculture Minister Sulaiman Daud
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry would hold discussions with its agencies, farmers'
organizations and fishermen's associations to find the appropriate
measures, he said after launching the National Farmers, Livestock
Farmers and Fishermen Day in Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia imported 11 billion ringgit (about 2.657 billion U.S.
dollars) worth of food materials last year compared to 10 billion
ringgit (about 2.415 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The minister said food imports in the first four months of the
year went down by 11.2 percent to 1.64 billion tons compared to
1.85 billion tons during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
This was because the people's response to the government's call
for producing their own food was encouraging as in the first four
months of the year, 8,240 hydroponics containers had been sold at
the ministry's Farming Complex.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the value of the imports during the period
under review rose to 2.38 billion ringgit (about 0.574 billion
U.S. dollars) from 1.85 billion ringgit (about 0.446 billion U.S.
dollars) due to the depreciation of the Ringgit.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the import of tropical fruits went
down by 96 percent, live fish down by 33.7 percent, beef by 18.2
percent, soya bean curd by 18.4 percent, farmfeed by 15.9 percent,
sugar by 12.4 percent and livestock by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
But during the same period, the import of rice went up by 13.5
percent to 209,000 tons worth 311 million ringgit (about 75.12
million U.S. dollars) compared to 184,000 tons worth 181 million
ringgit (about 43.719 million U.S. dollars) during the first four
months of 1997, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- This capital of east China's
Fujian Province has mobilized all possible forces to contribute to
the re-employment of displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou launched 20 large-scale labor fairs in the first half of
this year, re-employing 22,000 laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates have put Fuzhou's number of laid-off workers
from state-owned and collective enterprises at 49,000 this
year. The city government has vowed to help find jobs for at least
30,000, keeping the registered unemployment rate below 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
This year Fuzhou has unveiled a large number of preferential
policies to facilitate the re-employment of laid-off workers. The
city federation of trade unions, in cooperation with related
departments, has opened China's first telephone hot line
especially for re-employment purposes. Some 87 companies and
schools have provided technical training for nearly 3,000 laid-off
workers without any charge.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, more than 400 enterprises in Fuzhou have
promised to give prior consideration to displaced workers.

<HEADLINE> Flood Diversion Unnecessary at Jingjiang River Dikes, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese flood control authorities
confirmed today that, so far, it is not necessary to blow up the
Jinjiang River Dikes in Hubei Province to divert the Yangtze River
floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the present situation, there is no need to take
that step," said Zhao Chunming, deputy director of the office of
the state's Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, in
answer to questions at this afternoon's news conference.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not rule out the possibility of diverting the
flood at the Jingjiang River section if the situation there
continues to worsen.
</P>
<P>
In 1954, when the Yangtze River suffered serious floods, the
Jingjiang River Dikes had to be blown up for flood
diversion. Since then, this section of the Yangtze River has
become a sensitive issue whenever serious flooding occurs.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that the dikes and embankment of the Yangtze River
have been significantly reinforced during past decades, and are
now capable of containing floods more serious than that of 1954.
</P>
<P>
However, preparations are being made in the Jingjiang River
diversion area in case there is a need to divert the floodwaters,
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one hundred Banyamulenge
rebel soldiers of the Democratic Republic of Congo have fled into
Zambia and surrendered to the security forces in the last
two days.
</P>
<P>
Zambian government spokesman David Mpamba confirmed the
developments, and said that Zambia has closed temporarily two
northern border transit points in Kasumbalesa and Mokambo to
tighten the screening of the people entering the country, Zambia
Daily Mail reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, nearly 100 Banyamulenge soldiers
arrived in Kitwe and Chingola in Zambia's Northern Province
Tuesday. And another 20 rebel soldiers arrived in Mufulira where
they are now under guard at the city's police station.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Banyamulenge rebels now in Kitwe, Jerome
Tambwe, appealed on Wednesday to the Zambian government to
repatriate them to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the paper, Tambwe said the rwandese fled
Congo (K) after the Laurent Kabila government attempted to
disarm them before they entered Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said that some congolese soldiers are being demoted on
tribal lines while the Banyamulenge soldiers are asked to go back
to Rwanda, alleging that they are foreigners.

</P>
<P>
Elaborate programs had been taken for trained human resource in

</P>
<P>
The newly-formed employment bank and other commercial banks

<HEADLINE> Shandong Keen to Develop Environmental Protection Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province has
reported success in recent years in developing environmental
protection technologies.
</P>
<P>
The Jinan Yuxing Chemical Plant used to produce a large amount
of poisonous chromium dregs, which were the leading pollutants at
the source of the Xiaoqinghe river, a major river in the province.
</P>
<P>
Because of technical cooperation between the plant and Jinan
Iron and Steel Company, the pollution problem has been resolved,
saving the steel company annually up to one million yuan in raw
materials and the plant 1.7 million yuan in residue treatment
costs.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is an important industrial province where air blowers,
water pumps and boilers are the top three energy-consumption
equipment in large industrial projects, accounting for about
one-fourth of the province's use of electricity and one-third of
its coal consumption.
</P>
<P>
Technical renovation of the equipment since 1996 has resulted
in a saving of more than 300,000 tons of coal and 566 million
kilowatts-hour of electricity and a reduction of 155,000 tons of
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also show that technical advances have enabled
Shandong to reduce the discharge of 120 million tons of solid
industrial wastes for five years between 1991 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Because of the development of environmental protection
technology, the Dezhou Heat and Power Plant, for example, is now
able to re-use the 100,000 tons of powder coal it discharges each
year, generating some 112 million yuan in gross profits.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Almost Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar wandered
aimlessly Thursday, closing almost steady as it searched for
directional cues from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The local currency finished here at 60.68 U.S. cents, from
60.70 U.S. cents late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gains made against the U.S. dollar in offshore overnight
trading were surrendered due to continuing weakness in the
Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi confirmed he
would seek tax cuts of more than six trillion yen (about 42.8
billion U.S. dollars) Thursday did little to help the yen hold its
ground against the U.S. dollar.
</P>

<P>
CANBERRA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Selling across Asian share
markets and fears of further ructions on Wall Street dragged the
Australian stock market down Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The late slump, which eroded the market's firmer opening, left
the benchmark all ordinaries index wallowing 37.8 points down at
2602.4.

On top of Wednesday's 42 point fall, the local market has now
fallen 3 percent in two days.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Not Undermining Angola Peace Process: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
refuted South African media reports that Zambia is undermining
the Angolan peace process by supporting the rebel movement of
Angola.
</P>
<P>
It is preposterous for anybody to suggest that Zambia will
work to undermine the Angolan peace process it helped to bring
about in 1994, President Frederick Chiluba's aide, Richard
Sakala, said in an interview with the Southern African
Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) in Lusaka Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The international verification teams have visited Zambia
several times and in all cases found it not guilty of the
allegations, the Times of Zambia newspaper Thursday quoted Sakala
as saying.
</P>
<P>
South African media reports have stated that Angola is getting
impatient with Zambia because of its perceived support for the
rebel National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
forces.
</P>
<P>
Sakala noted that the reports have come up at a time when
relations between Zambia and Angola are "warm and cordial".
</P>
<P>
He said: " Zambia has hosted official Angolan delegations that
have visited our border to establish the truth of these
allegations, which in many cases have emanated from press reports
in South Africa."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports in South Africa suggested that UNITA has
secured arms supply lines through Zambia by capturing the town of
Luau in Angola's Moxico Province, giving it easy access to arms
through Zambia, said the Zambian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Sakala denied such arms supply lines through Zambia, saying
that Zambia is keen to ensure peace in Angola for economic,
social and political reasons.

<HEADLINE> Aussi Tech to Be Used to Dispose of U.S. Plutonium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Australian technology will help
keep surplus United States weapons-grade plutonium safely
immobilized, the Australian federal government announced here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Science and Industry Minister John Moore announced
the deal with the U.S. Department of Energy Thursday in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet-U.S. nuclear arms race left a legacy of
weapons-grade plutonium which the superpowers have agreed to
reduce," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
The project would use a Synroc-based ceramic.
</P>
<P>
Synroc, developed by the late Professor Ted Ringwood of the
Australian National University and further refined at Australian
Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO), is an
advanced ceramic made of titanate minerals which immobilize
radioactive elements in nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
Moore said ANSTO had been working for about four years with the
designated lead laboratory for developing immobilization
technology in the U.S., the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
in California, to come up with the best ceramic material for the
job.
</P>
<P>
"Although it has taken a long time for Synroc to be
implemented, I am confident it will now come into its own and be
used extensively in other radioactive waste management projects,"
Moore said.

HANGZHOU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
reported 209 billion yuan in gross domestic product in the first
half of the year, a rise of 9.4 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
This is largely attributed to the increased investment,
according to Chen Daxin, head of Zhejiang Provincial Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises spent 31 billion yuan on fixed assets
from January to June, a rise of 23.6 percent from the same period
last year. The province had 91.79 billion yuan in retail sales in
the first half, up 8 percent. It also did 7.06 billion
U.S. dollars worth of foreign trade, a rise of 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The province also approved 482 overseas-backed enterprises,
with contracts worth 880 million U.S. dollars. Both figures are
increases from last year.
</P>
<P>
By June, bank savings in the province were 45.96 billion yuan
more than that at the beginning of the year, and 19.97 billion
yuan was loaned in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Zhejiang will continue to do well in economic
performance in the latter half because of increased fixed assets
investment and macro-economic measures starting to take effect and
it is expected to meet this year's goal of 8 percent
growth.

<HEADLINE> Ashrawi Resigns From Arafat's Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hanan Ashrawi, the
newly-appointed Minister of Tourism and Archaeology in the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), resigned on Thursday to
protest the lack of reform in the cabinet reshuffle made by PNA
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in the West Bank city Ramallah,
Ashrawi said she would continue to be a member of the Palestinian
Legislative Council (PLC), "but not as a member of this
government."
</P>
<P>
Her move was apparently in protest against the failure by
Arafat to tackle the widely reported corruption within the
cabinet, which was the main reason behind the latest cabinet
shakeup.
</P>
<P>
Arafat on Wednesday presented the lineup of his new cabinet to
the PLC for approval. But to the disappointment of his critics,
all the ministers accused of being corrupt in the previous cabinet
retained their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi, who served as Minister of Higher Education, was
transferred to the post of tourism and archaeology.
</P>
<P>
She said she rejected Arafat's offer because "I believe that
comprehensive reform was not addressed in this new government
formulation."
</P>
<P>
She also expressed discontent with the way of handling the
peace negotiations with Israel by the Palestinian leadership.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Companies Invest More in East China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's investment in
Zhangzhou, a coastal city of east China's Fujian Province,
continued to grow in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhangzhou approved 112 Hong Kong-funded enterprises in the
first six months, about 54 percent of the number of all
overseas-funded firms were established during the period. Hong
Kong companies' pledged investment of 240 million U.S. dollars was
57 percent of the total contracted investment in Zhangzhou for the
January-June period.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, the number of Hong Kong-funded enterprises
and the value of contracted investment was up 111 percent and 37
percent, respectively, from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the surge in investment from Hong
Kong to strengthening economic and trade contacts between
Zhangzhou and Hong Kong, the introduction of a series of
preferential policies for investors, and the increased effort to
improve the local investment environment.

<HEADLINE> S. African Business Confidence Drops Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South African business
confidence took a knock for the third successive month, slumping
1.9 percent in July, said a senior official of the South African
Chamber of Business (Sacob).
</P>
<P>
The decline of 1.9 percent last month after falls of 1.2
percent and 5.7 percent in May and June showed that the South
African economy remained vulnerable to both internal and external
pressures as well as the aftershock of currency instability which
began in late May, the Business Day newspaper Thursday quoted
Sacob saying.
</P>
<P>
Sacob economic policy director, Ben van Rensburg, said that the
continual business mood of uncertainty reflected a weaker
economic outlook, higher interest rates, slackening internal
demand and South Africa's emerging-market risk profile, with the
resultant dampening effect on potential foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"The concern of business that real interest will remain at its
present levels and therefore higher than originally anticipated,
contributed to the weakening of business confidence," van
Rensburg said.
</P>
<P>
The prime lending rates of commercial banks now stands at 24
percent and mortgage rates at 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Van Rensburg said the recent financial developments would lead
to slower economic growth and Sacob had revised its growth rate
forecast down to one percent for this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Sacob believed that the economy would grow by between
two and 2.5 percent next year as stability returned and the
impact of the demutualization of Sanlam and Old Mutual, two major
insurance companies, became evident.
</P>
<P>
Just two months before the Rand began to slide, South Africa
had been rated as one of the most attractive investment
opportunities in the emerging economies, but global developments
were working slowly against the assessment, van Rensburg said.

<HEADLINE> Ashrawi Resigns From Arafat's Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hanan Ashrawi, the
newly-appointed Minister of Tourism and Archaeology in the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), resigned on Thursday to
protest the lack of reform in the cabinet reshuffle made by PNA
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in the West Bank city Ramallah,
Ashrawi said she would continue to stay in the Palestinian
Legislative Council (PLC), and would contribute her knowledge and
wisdom to it as an elected member.
</P>
<P>
Her move was apparently in protest against the failure by
Arafat to tackle the widely reported corruption within the
cabinet, which was the main reason behind the latest cabinet
shakeup.
</P>
<P>
Arafat on Wednesday presented the lineup of his new cabinet to
the PLC for approval. But to the disappointment of his critics,
all the ministers accused of being corrupt in the previous cabinet
retained their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi, who served as Minister of Higher Education, was
transferred to the post of tourism and archaeology.
</P>
<P>
She said she rejected Arafat's offer because "I believe that
comprehensive reform was not addressed in this new government
formulation."
</P>
<P>
Before announcing her resignation, Ashrawi held a long meeting
Wednesday night with Arafat to explain here reason to quit. She
said the Palestinian people are facing a very difficult time both
at home and abroad, and to face the challenge needs comprehensive
reform in the government.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed discontent with the way of handling the
peace negotiations with Israel by the Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks have been stalled since early
last year due to Israel's expansion of settlements and delay in
carrying out troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But Ashrawi added that she respects Arafat very much and still
supports him to seek peace for the entire Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi gained her world fame as the spokeswoman for the
Palestinian delegation during the Israeli-Palestinian peace
negotiations in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
As a former professor of English at Bir Zeit University in
Ramallah, she was elected to the PLC in the first Palestinian

<HEADLINE> 1,000 S. African Police Slain in 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A shocking number of 1,015
South African police had been murdered since 1994, and the police
are now sick and tired of being hunted like unprotected game,
according to a Pretoria judge.
</P>
<P>
Judge Theo Grobbelaar told the Pretoria High Court Wednesday
that last year, 88 members of the South African Police Service
(SAPS) were murdered on duty and 149 while off duty.
</P>
<P>
This year, up to the end of March, 27 on-duty police officers
were murdered and 33 were murdered while off duty, The Star
newspaper Thursday quoted the judge as saying.
</P>
<P>
Judge Grobbelaar revealed the shocking statistics while
sentencing 35-year-old Kobane Caiphus Makena to 65 years in jail
for the murder of a policeman and also for robbery and
housebreaking.
</P>
<P>
"The public is sick and tired of any form of crime and I
accept that members of the police are also sick and tired of
being hunted like unprotected game," Grobbelaar said.
</P>
<P>
"It is tragic that, in this beautiful country of ours, murder
and the slaughter of innocent people has taken on epidemic
proportions and seems to have developed into a national sport,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Detective Nathanael Philippus Roets, 25, was shot twice when
he caught Makena and a friend red-handed after they broke into a
house in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Man Suspected Of Involvement In Taiwanese Woman's Death Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAICHENG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Police in the northeast China
province of Liaoning have arrested a Liaoning man, Zhang Shifeng,
who is suspected of being involved in the death of Lin Ti-chuan, a
Taiwanese woman who was killed while on a business trip to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was apprehended at about 11 a.m. this morning on a train
going from Yantai in east China's Shangdong Province to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Another suspect in the case, Huang Shidong, a farmer from the
city of Haicheng, was caught in Mulan County in Heilongjiang
Province on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
So far police have ascertained that the kidnapping of the woman
was plotted by a Haicheng businessman, Li Guangzhi, and was
carried out by by Huang, Zhang, and two other men, Yang Rongxi and
Zhao Chuang.
</P>
<P>
Huang has confessed during an interrogation that he and the
others abducted Lin Ti-chuan and a Taiwanese businessman named Wei
Tien-kang, and took them to an empty room in the Haicheng
Development Zone on the evening of July 27, soon after their
arrival in the port city of Dalian in Liaoning. The motive was an
attempt to force Wei to return some money that he owed Li.
</P>
<P>
Yang Rongxi gave both Wei and Lin several injections to knock
them out, and Lin began to suffer respiratory difficulties and
turned pale 11 a.m. on July 29. Huang then sent Lin to a local
hospital in Haicheng, where he discovered that Lin had died, and
fled.
</P>
<P>
The police are now making all-out efforts to search for the
other people who may be involved in the case.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Victorian State to Regulate Traditional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Victorian state
government Thursday announced a plan to regulate the practice of
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
</P>
<P>
Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett announced the plan to develop a
legislative framework in Melbourne, on the basis of a 1995
Department of Human Services (DHS) report, capital of the state.
</P>
<P>
"Victoria is the first jurisdiction outside China to adopt a
comprehensive regulatory regime for TCM," he told guests at the
launch of the report.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation said other states or
territories in Australia, or even the Australian federal
government, and other Western nations may follow suit if the
framework would be passed by the state parliament as law.
</P>
<P>
"Through the adoption of the recommendations in this report we
will ensure a regulatory framework that is a response to the needs
of both the community and practitioners," said the premier.
</P>
<P>
Robert Doyle, the Victorian government's parliamentary
secretary for health, said TCM had become an increasingly popular
form of health care with an estimated 2.8 million consultations
each year representing an annual turnover of over 48 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new laws will be designed to protect the public, ensuring
practitioners have a minimum qualification.
</P>
<P>
Professor T. Chiang Lin, president of the Federation of the
Chinese Medicine Association, described the practice as "a
treasure of modern civilization" and thanked Kennett for his
active involvement in regulating the profession.
</P>
<P>
"Victoria is providing leadership to the rest of Australia and
internationally," he told the assembled guests.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't, Rebels to Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will resume peace talks
in a southern city on August 18 to tackle some substantive issues,
the government's chief negotiator said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are not only opening the door towards peace, but we are
opening wider so that we can accommodate more thoughts toward the
attainment of peace in Mindanao," retired Lt. Gen. Orlando Soriano
said.
</P>
<P>
Soriano was speaking to reporters when signing an agreement
with the MNLF calling for both sides to refrain from conducting
combat operations while the peace talks are underway.
</P>
<P>
Alunan Glang, who signed the agreement on behalf of the MILF,
said that the group is "determined to pursue these negotiations
until the successful conclusion is reached with goodwill on both
sides."
</P>
<P>
Soriano said that the government is working hard for the
successful conclusion of the peace talks and "we certainly also
appreciate the efforts being done by our MILF brothers towards
attaining peace."
</P>
<P>
The MILF, headed by Hashim Salamat, is a breakaway faction of
the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) which signed a peace
accord with the government in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government has been negotiating with the MILF to sign a
separate peace agreement. The MILF is basically based in Central
Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Low-level peace talks between the government and the MILF
started in January 1997 but were suspended by the MILF during the
presidential elections held in May this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese flood-control official
today reaffirmed the expected positive role of the Three Gorges
Project in flood control.
</P>
<P>
The big dam of the giant Three Gorges Project, if now in use,
would have helped to intercept floods in the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River, Zhao Chunming, an official of the General Office of
the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, told a
news conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"If there were the big dam this year, the water level in the
lower reaches would not have been that high and the flood control
task would not have been that arduous," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is essential to build the big dam and the Three
Gorges Project, Zhao told journalists at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts to conserve water and soil and to prevent
and control soil erosion, he said, the ecological environment in
the Three Gorges area is good overall.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project, which began in December of 1994, is
situated on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and is a major
part of China's effort to develop the country's longest river. The
Damming of the river for construction of the project was completed
last November, and the whole project will take 17 years to
complete.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Traditional Artwork Being Smuggled (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, August 6, (Xinhua) - A Chinese legislative
sub-committee has found that an increasing number of valuable
works of art created by Chinese ethnic minorities over thousands
of years are being smuggled out the country.
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Education, Sciences, Culture and Public
Health under the National People's Congress is also proposing
related laws to counter this crime.
</P>
<P>
In a recent investigative tour of Northwest China's Gansu
Province, rich in history and diverse in ethnic minority
inhabitants, the sub-committee found that "an astonishing amount"
of leather-silhouette show tools, paper-cutting products, wood
sculpture, brick sculpture, Hui embroideries and Tibetan
traditional dress and personal adornment are being lost to
collectors in Japan, Korea and some American and European
countries.
</P>
<P>
These works of art, which are dying inside China because of
economic development, are representative of the culture of
northwest China and unique to the tradition of the ethnic
minorities who produced them.
</P>
<P>
The investigative team found that "overseas organizations and
individuals, including business people, scholars and students are
flocking to places home to rich cultural legacies to collect those
items or even buy them at unusually high prices."
</P>
<P>
"Those collectors seem to be well-organized and are
well-planned," an official with the sub-committee said, noting
that they go to villages not only fishing for paper-cutting
products and Tibetan cloth pictures, but also buying traditional
tools such as steel for flint.
</P>
<P>
"That's no longer individual hobby or interests; it's cultural
robbery," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Traditional Artwork Being Smuggled (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Koreans reportedly are accumulating legacies of China's
Dongxiang nationality, and the Japanese Folk Custom Society
declared 10 years ago its intent to amass Chinese materials for
its study.
</P>
<P>
Qingyang Prefecture of Gansu Province is known for its
traditional leather-silhouette show. The sub-committee has learned
the oldest set of leather-silhouette show equipment dating back to
the late Qing Dynasty was bought by a tourist from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The sub-committee said that, because there is no related laws,
it is impossible to curb the smuggling trend. Some localities are
even relying on foreign buyers as a source of income.
</P>
<P>
The outcome is that it is hard to find these valuables in
China while foreign people are opening museums and exhibitions of
those items, the sub-committee said. China's existing law on
cultural relics does not cover the protection of all the cultural
legacies of ethnic minorities, the investigative team said.
</P>
<P>
"So it is necessary for China to garner efforts to make laws
in this respect," it stressed, advocating that a special expert
committee should be established to assess all the traditional
items of artistic creation of ethnic minorities, and localities
should also formulate regulations based on their own need "to ease
the present acute situation."

<HEADLINE> More Tropical Storms to Hit Southeast China in Near Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Four to six tropical cyclones or
typhoons may come into being over northwest Pacific and South
China Sea, of which two or three may land in the southeast coast

In the coming 10 days, the major rain-belts are expected to
linger over the eastern part of north China, most areas in
northeast China, the areas between Yellow and Huaihe rivers, the
eastern part of southwest China and the coastal areas in both

Meteorological Administration, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Two or three tropical cyclones are expected to develop over
northwest Pacific and South China Sea, of which one or two is
likely to affect or land in the coastal areas in south and
southeast China,
</P>

<HEADLINE> Boy Gets Compensation For Arm Bitten Off by Bear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 6, (Xinhua) -- Wei Xingyu, a 9-year-old boy
whose left arm was bitten by a brown bear and later amputated, was
entitled to compensation of 560,000 yuan (69,000 U.S. dollars),
according to a ruling by the Sichuan Provincial Higher People's
Court.
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 20, 1996, Lin Jianqiong, who is the boy's aunt, took
him to Qionghai Park where she worked in Xichang County, Liangshan
Autonomous Prefecture of Yi Nationalities, in southwest China's
Sichuan Province. While he was at the park, a bear bit Wei's left
arm while he was feeding the bear with grass. The accident forced
the amputation of the boy's left arm, today's Shanghai-based "Wen
Hui Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
After the tragedy happened, the Liangshan Prefecture's
Intermediate People's Court conducted the initial trial, but the
plaintiff and defendants refused to accept the ruling and lodged
appeals to a higher court.
</P>
<P>
The Sichuan Provincial Higher People's Court ruled that
Qionghai Park and the boy's temporary guardian, Lin Jianqiong,
should pay the plaintiff a compensation fee of 450,819 yuan and
112,705 yuan, respectively, within 30 days.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies Barring U.N. Inspectors From Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq denied Thursday that it had
banned a U.N. arms inspection team from entering a weapons site
here, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
An official source at the Iraqi National Monitoring
Directorate was quoted as saying there was no question of Iraq's
banning U.N. inspection teams from carrying out their duties
because "there is no arms inspection team in Iraq right now."
</P>
<P>
"All the U.N. arms inspectors here belong to long-term
monitoring teams," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that according to Wednesday's decision made by the
Iraqi government, activities of the long-term monitoring teams are
allowed to continue, and in fact all monitoring activities are
going on smoothly on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that an inspection team of the U.N. Special
Commission for disarmament in Iraq, or UNSCOM, was refused access
to an Iraqi weapons site Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi government announced Wednesday it would freeze
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors in protest against the
eight year long crippling U.N. sanctions imposed after the 1990
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
It conditioned the resumption of the cooperation on the
reestablishment of the UNSCOM and other changes regarding the
U.N. weapons inspection mission in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq said all U.N. monitoring activities will be allowed on
the conditions that U.N. monitors must respect Iraq's sovereignty,
security and its people's dignity.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi decision to freeze cooperation with UNSCOM was
made following the breakdown of the latest round of talks held
between UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler and Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Aziz refused to continue the talks to protest Butler's refusal
to give a clean bill of health on Iraq's weapons programs, a
condition set by the U.N. for the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The seven year long U.N. inspection mission has been marred by
repeated confrontations between Iraq and the U.S., which has been
taking a tough stance on destroying Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq charges the U.S. for ignoring the progress already made in
the inspection in an attempt to prolong the crippling economic
sanctions, that have banned the free sale of oil, Iraq's economic
lifelines.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Reduce Diplomatic Missions Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran has decided to close a number
of diplomatic missions abroad in line with the government's
austerity plan, the Tehran Times daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plan to reduce the number of Iranian diplomatic missions
and their staff would be given top priority to help the government
slash spendings, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi did not specify the countries where the Iranian
embassies will be closed.
</P>
<P>
But he said that "we are going to close our diplomatic missions
in countries which do not have very friendly relations with Iran
and those which do not have significant economic cooperation with
our country."
</P>
<P>
This decision was in line with an economic plan announced by
President Mohammad Khatami last Sunday, which was aimed at
lowering the financial burden of the government and helping revive
the oil-dependent economy.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the government is facing mounting pressures due to
the decrease in foreign exchange revenues as a result of oil price
fall in the world market in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry has worked out a program to train
diplomats in how to promote trade with foreign countries where
they are assigned to work.

<HEADLINE> Floods Claim Over 2,000 Lives In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Seasonal floods, since June, have
claimed more than 2,000 lives, Vice-Minister of Water Resources
Zhou Wenzhi announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou told a news conference that 90 percent of the deaths were
caused by flood waters, landslides and mud-flows, and the rest
were killed by capsizings, electrocutions and road accidents.
</P>
<P>
However, no one was killed when some 13 million people who had
been affected were relocated on large-scale, he noted.
</P>
<P>
A number of productive dykes of the Yangtze River have
collapsed because of sustained high water levels, huge water flows
and weakness in some dykes, according to Zhao Chunming, deputy
director of the Office of the State Flood Control and Drought
Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
On August 1, productive dykes in Jiayu County, Hubei Province,
collapsed, which led a loss of 13 lives including five
soldiers. All the 50,000 local residents were removed to safe
places, Zhao said at the same news conference.
</P>
<P>
In another case, no one were killed when dykes around a small
island in the Yangtze River went breached on August 4. All the
40,000 villagers were relocated in time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao stressed that so far all major Yangtze dykes, major cities
and key roads and railways have remained intact.
</P>
<P>
The floods have brought enormous economic losses to flood-hit
areas, said Vice-Minister of Civil Affairs Fan Baojun, noting that
240 million people in 28 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions have been affected by the floods, with 13.8 million people
relocated to safe places, 5.58 million houses destroyed, and 12.05
million houses suffering damages.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 21.53 million ha. of farmland were affected,
including 4.78 million ha. of farmlands with their crops totally
destroyed, according to the vice-minister.
</P>
<P>
The central government has provided more than 1.9 billion yuan
worth of relief funds and large quantities of relief materials to
the flood-affected areas, and local governments in 12 provinces
and municipalities have also appropriated 720 million yuan for the
same purpose.
</P>
<P>
The local governments have distributed nearly 290,000 tons of
cereals and 6.31 million pieces of wears and quilts to flood
victims, while 346,000 make-shifts have been erected for those who
have been made homeless by the floods, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Fan pledged that each of the flood victims will receive a half
kg of grain every day.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have also aroused people to make donations to
the flood victims. So far, Hunan and Hubei, the two most affected
provinces, have got 47 million yuan in cash and 41.8 million yuan
in kind, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister paid tribute to the army, police and reserve
servicemen for the remarkable role they have played in battling
against the floods. Meanwhile, he noted, the troops and policemen
have also made large amount of donations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government will work hard to implement the
rehabilitation programs and build winter-shelters for the
homeless, and flood victims will get their winter clothing and
quilts from the government and donors, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also assured that all donations will be properly used as
efforts will be made to step up supervision and management over
the distribution of donations.

<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Seasonal floods, accompanied by
landslides and mud-flows have claimed a relatively heavy loss of
lives and brought enormous economic losses to China, a senior
Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Civil Affairs Fan Baojun told a news
conference that 240 million people in 28 provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions have been affected by the floods,
with 13.8 million people relocated to safe places, 5.58 million
houses destroyed, and 12.05 million houses suffering damages.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 21.53 million ha. of farmland were affected,
including 4.78 million ha. of farmlands with their crops totally
destroyed, according to the vice-minister.
</P>
<P>
The central government has provided more than 1.9 billion yuan
worth of relief funds and large quantities of relief materials to
the flood-affected areas, and local governments in 12 provinces
and municipalities have allocated 720 million yuan for the same
purpose.
</P>
<P>
The local governments have distributed nearly 290,000 tons of
cereals and 6.31 million pieces of wears and covers to flood
victims, while 346,000 make-shifts have been erected for those who
have been made homeless by the floods, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Fan pledged that each of the flood victims will receive a half
kg of grain every day.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have also mobilized people to make donations
to the flood victims. So far, Hunan and Hubei, the two most
affected provinces, have got 47 million yuan in cash and 41.8
million yuan in kind, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister paid tribute to the army, police and reserve
servicemen for the remarkable role they have played in battling

rehabilitation programs and build winter-shelters for the
homeless, and the flood victims will get their winter clothing and
quilts from the government and donors, he said.

<HEADLINE> Contaminated Water Kills 12 Children in New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- As many as 12 children have
died and over 100 taken ill in a slum cluster in west Delhi during
the past 10 days due to suspected contaminated water supplied by
private water tankers, the Statesman daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The children had complained of loose motions, vomiting and in
some cases, fever after drinking the water, described by a local
dweller as raw and yellow in color.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary inquiry by district administration pointed out
that the water was supplied to the dwellers by two private
contractors at the instance of the Delhi Development Authority
(DDA).
</P>
<P>
The dwellers, about 900, had been relocated in Kakrola in west
Delhi last month by the DDA from a park in the city, according to
the Statesman.
</P>
<P>
Delhi Chief Minister Sahib Singh has ordered an inquiry into
the death of the children by the deputy commissioner of South-West
District.
</P>
<P>
The Central Pollution Control Board said last Sunday that water
supply in New Delhi was "unsafe" for drinking and it did not meet
the standards prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
According to a report submitted by the board to Delhi High
Court, samples of raw and treated water collected in April this
year indicated the presence of pesticides. And the Yamuna river, a
main water source for the capital, was seriously polluted with
organic matter and fecal coliform.

<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Seasonal floods, accompanied with
landslides and mud-flows have claimed a relatively heavy loss of
lives and brought enormous economic losses to China, a senior
Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Civil Affairs Fan Baojun told a news
conference that 240 million people in 28 provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions have been affected by the floods to varying
degrees, with 13.8 million people relocated to safe places, 5.58
million houses destroyed, and damages done to 12.05 million houses.

<HEADLINE> Soybean Price Down to Four-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Soybean futures Wednesday
fell close to four-year lows on the Chicago Board of Trade,
weighed down by expectations for large supplies and weak demand,
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Soybeans for November delivery, representing prices after the
fall harvest, fell 6.5 cents to 5.4125 U.S. dollar a bushel, the
lowest since October 1994.
</P>
<P>
Market sources say there were several factors behind the
remarkable drop of soybean prices.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, they pointed out, the beneficial rains in U.S. Midwest
and some Southern growing regions appeared to all-but-seal
expectations that farmers this fall will harvest the largest crop
on record.
</P>
<P>
Some market participants are speculating the crop's size could
top 3 billion bushels, much higher than 2.83 billion bushel
estimated by U.S. Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, there has been large supplies in the international
markets. Brazil, Argentina and other major soybean growing
countries all had large harvests last year which created abundant
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Finally, there are few overseas takers because of Asian
economic woes. Market analysts believe that Asian demand will
continue to be weak or dried up in the coming year.

<HEADLINE> Intel is Losing Grip Over Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., a colossus of
chipmakers, is losing its vice-like grip over the business, a new
study released today.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of businesses in the United States say they
are willing to consider buying computers powered by chips made by
Intel's rivals, according to the July survey by ZD Market
Intelligence, a market analysis firm based in California.
</P>
<P>
About 34 percent of 2,624 U.S. businesses showed interest in
PCs with AMD or Cyrix chips instead of Intel-based processors,
while 27 percent said they were "highly motivated" to buy either
AMD or Cyrix powered computers.
</P>
<P>
For years, Intel has controlled over 90 percent of the consumer
and business markets for processors. But now AMD and Cyrix account
for a combined 60 percent of the market for desktops selling under
1,000 U.S. dollars and 38 percent of total X86 desktop PCs selling
in the U.S. retail channel in June. In June 1997, only five
percent of total desktop PCs sold in retail used non-Intel
chips.
</P>
<P>
Computer customers nowadays do not care what the brand of
processor inside the computer.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Low in Carbon Monoxide Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand emits below the
average levels for carbon monoxide and sulphur oxide, but over the
average level for nitrogen oxide on a per capita basis, according
to the set standards by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
A Statistics New Zealand's report, which was released here
Thursday noted that open fires were a major source of urban air
pollution in a number of New Zealand cities and towns, with almost
23 percent of all households in 1996 still using this form of home
heating. But the report said that the number of homes with open
fires has been declining steadily.
</P>
<P>
According to other environmental statistics provided in the
report, New Zealand's methane output is relatively high for the
size of the country, due to its agriculture base and subsequent
emissions from livestock. Its per capital emissions of methane are
nine times the global average.
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide concentrations over the southern hemisphere are
presently increasing at a rate of approximately 0.4 percent per
year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that further ozone depletion will continue
till the end of this century. "The next five to 10 years will see
the greatest damage to the ozone layer," the report warned.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Undertake Program for Flood-Hit Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
approved 81.2 million taka (about 1.73 million U.S. dollars) for
an emergency agriculture rehabilitation program in the
flood-affected areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
This allocation was approved Wednesday by the Ministry of
Finance upon the proposals of the Agriculture Ministry, a press
report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The money would be used for providing assistance to small and
marginal farmers in their rehabilitation work after havoc caused
by heavy flood since early the July-October monsoon season.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, about 420,000 hectares of cropland in 55 of the
country's 64 districts have been damaged due to flooding caused by
incessant rains, onrush of hilly waters and waters from across the
borders.
</P>
<P>
Besides, more than 17.4 million people have been affected by
the flood, which has also damaged and washed away 5,100 kilometers
of roads, 2,396 kilometers of embankment with 2,215 bridges and
culverts and perished nearly 6,000 cattle, according to
preliminary estimates.
</P>
<P>
The government departments concerned have so far distributed
more than 13.2 million taka (about 280,850 dollars), nearly 30,000
tons of grain and other relief materials to the flood-hit people.
</P>
<P>
The overall flood situation in the country is improving as
water in the major rivers is receding gradually, though the
situation might deteriorate again in northern and northwestern
areas of the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins and upper parts of the
Meghna basin, according to the Flood Information Center.

<HEADLINE> Lin Ti-Chuan Relatives Affirm Help from Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- "I'm very, very grateful for all
the Haicheng side has done for us," the father of Lin Ti-chuan,
the Taiwan woman killed in Haicheng city in Liaoning Province,
said today.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his gratitude at a farewell breakfast held in
Haicheng.
</P>
<P>
The grieving father, who had been silent for days here, showed
his feelings today to the Taiwan Affairs Office of Liaoning
Province, saying loudly: "Thank you! thank you all!"
</P>
<P>
Another Lin relative said at the breakfast that "through the
handling of the aftermath of Miss Lin Ti-chuan's tragedy, I feel
that the ties between the people across the Taiwan Straits are
closer."
</P>
<P>
He said he will tell the Kaohsiung public when he returns how
they were received and treated cordially by the people of Haicheng.
</P>
<P>
He also invited Chen Yonghao, deputy director of the provincial
Taiwan Affairs Office, to visit Taiwan, saying,"I will treat you."
</P>
<P>
Lin's remains were transported to Beijing at 6:00 a.m. this
morning and will be returned to Taiwan via Hong Kong at the
request of Lin's family.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Babaoshan International Remains Transportation
Department changed its Beijing-Macao-Taiwan schedule because of a
request from Lin's family that her remains be returned to
Kaohsiung by sunset.
</P>
<P>
Two hours after the agreement was reached yesterday afternoon,
11 of Lin's relatives said that they would leave Haicheng this
morning via Shenyang for Beijing. However, since they did not have
the proper travel documents, according to Chinese rules they were
required to exit by Dalian, from which they had entered.
</P>
<P>
However, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), the provincial Taiwan Affairs Office, and the
local government worked overnight to have their travel documents
prepared and air tickets ready.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Lin's parents said that they also expected to be
accommodated at a hotel near Babaoshan, and be offered ideal
places to chant Buddhist sutras for mourning their daughter at
5:00 a.m. in the morning and 5:00 p.m. in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
When they were ready to leave Haicheng, they were told, "all
set," and Lin's parents and relatives left Haicheng at 9:00
a.m. today.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Stricken Hubei Province Declares State Of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province has
declared a state of emergency beginning at 8:00 am today to combat
rampant flooding fueled by the latest round of torrential rains to
hit the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
This decision by the provincial government was made in
accordance with the Anti-Flood Law.
</P>
<P>
Under this law, local flood control headquarters are empowered
to make decisions during the emergency period on flood-related
matters such as removing obstacles from roads and bridges,
mobilizing materials, vehicles and laborers, and taking control of
communications facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, water levels in the province
have surpassed historic highs in most parts of the Yangtze, with
the water level at the Jianli Hydrometric Station reaching 37.81
meters at 8:00 pm on Wednesday, exceeding the 1954 record by 1.24
meters.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has given a do-or-die order to local
people to safeguard major cities and dykes along the Yangtze and
its tributary Lianjiang River.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, the local government of Jinjiang City
gave up six small dikes in order to concentrate its manpower on
protecting the main Yangtze dikes, and some 100,000 local
residents have been relocated to safe places, according to a local
report.
</P>
<P>
The water levels of the Yangtze are expected to rise still
further due to the formation of this years' fourth flood peak on
the upper reaches.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Strengthens Protection of Agricultural Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
has adopted a series of laws and regulations designed to protect
the agricultural environment.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the province has per capita arable land of only
0.5 mu (15 mu equal one hectare) has stymied agricultural
development, with rising pollution exacerbating the situation even
further.
</P>
<P>
The province has responded by enacting environmental protection
regulations which require governments at all levels to include the
protection of agricultural environment in local economic and social
development programs.
</P>
<P>
The regulation upholds the principle of "putting prevention
first and combining prevention with pollution control" in
protecting the agricultural environment. It also contains
stipulations related to the establishment of a responsibility
system for strengthening environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The regulation prohibits the construction or expansion of
environmentally unsound projects; strictly prohibits discharges of
industrial wastewater, gases and dust particles into the
agricultural environment; and bans discharges of garbage and solid
waste materials into rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
The regulation, which will take effect on October 1, outlines
strict penalties for polluters.

<HEADLINE> International Congress of Genetics to Open in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The 18th International Congress
of Genetics (ICG) will be held at the Beijing International
Convention Center Aug. 10-15. Preparatory work for the conference
has been in full swing, according to a congress organizer.
</P>
<P>
About 1,600 geneticists from 53 countries -- including the
United States, Britain, Germany, Japan, India, Russia and China --
have applied for attendance, said Chen Siliang, an official with
the ICG Chinese organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
A dozen keynote lectures and 55 symposiums will be held during
the six-day event. About 150 leading geneticists are scheduled to
give speeches, discussing the latest findings in genetics which
can be used to increase grain production, treat diseases and
protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the 18th ICG, "Genetics -- A Better Life for All,"
underlines the purpose of the congress, which is the application
of genetic research findings to the improvement of the quality of
human life.
</P>
<P>
Some subjects -- such as the human genome project, cloning
technology and the prevention of abuse of genetic technology --
are expected to be controversial during the academic event, which
is held every five years.
</P>
<P>
"China for the first time hosts such a big congress of
genetics; it will be a good opportunity for Chinese geneticists to
conduct exchanges," said Prof. Zhu Lihuang, deputy director of the
Institute of Genetics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The International Genetics Federation plans to elect a new
executive board during the congress.

<HEADLINE> Heart Surgeons Introduce New Procedure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in central China's Hunan
Province have successfully completed a surgical operation on the
heart of a local woman, leaving only a 9-cm scar on her breast.
</P>
<P>
Liao Yan, a patient who was suffering congenital heart
disease, received the operation recently at the Changsha Xiangya
Hospital affiliated to the Human Medical Sciences University.
</P>
<P>
The 9-cm incision was one third of the length of incisions left
by traditional operations for heart diseases, the doctors said. It
stretched from the patient's left armpit to the base of her left
breast and was made at the interval between the ribs.
</P>
<P>
When compared to opening the chest cavity vertically, the new
procedure eliminated the need to remove ribs and thus the length
of the incision was radically reduced.
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted the operation left only a small scar," said Liao,
adding that the location greatly facilitates post-surgical
care.

<HEADLINE> Study: Surgery Also Helps Patients Aged over 100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A study released Wednesday
said that people aged over 100 who have operable diseases or
injuries should not be denied surgical interventions because of
their advanced age.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by researchers at the Mayo Foundation in
Rochester, Minnesota, and appeared in the August issue of the
Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, said that the Mayo
team examined the medical records of 31 Minnesota patients, aged
100 to 107 years at the time of surgery.
</P>
<P>
All of the patients, two old men and 29 old women, underwent a
total of 42 operations requiring anesthesia between 1975 -
1994. The researchers reported that the 2-day, one-month, and
one-year postsurgical death rates were 0 percent, 16.1 percent,
and 35.5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
These survival rates are equivalent to those of individuals of
similar age and background not undergoing surgery, the researchers
added.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the researchers believe surgery is often crucial in
helping centenarians. "People 100 years of age and older without
life-threatening disease may undergo surgical procedures without
further increasing their immediate risk of death," they concluded.
</P>
<P>
The findings are contrary to expectations. Many surgeons are
hesitant to operate on extremely old patients, due to fears that
these "frail" individuals are more harmed than helped by surgical
interventions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that average lifespans continue to rise in many
countries and recent census reports that there are now well over
50,000 centenarians living in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Consumer Goods Market Expected to Grow Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Official statistics show that Shanghai's sales of consumer
goods totaled 71.3 billion yuan in the first six months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has targeted its sales of consumer goods at 147
billion yuan for the whole of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the state policies to stimulate domestic
demand will constitute a favorable factor for the growth of sales
of consumer goods in the second half. The referred policies
include an increase in money supply and medium- and long-term
loans, the effort to reform the fund-raising and investment
practices, increased fiscal support for infrastructure
construction and others.
</P>
<P>
Housing reform will help to activate housing sales and
facilitate the development of related industries, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's increased cooperation with the United States in the
areas of economy, trade and investment, accelerated reform in
state-owned enterprises, and steadily rising incomes of its
residents will also boost sales of consumer goods, they
added.
</P>
<P>
The experts also said that the increasing negative effects of
the Asian financial crisis will be the leading factor affecting
sales of consumer goods in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that in the first half of this
year, the growth rate of Shanghai's exports was down 3.2
percentage points from a year ago and investments in Shanghai
from Asian nations and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan plunged 50
percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
A steep drop in the number of tourists from Japan, the Republic
of Korea and other Asian countries has directly affected sales in
industries such as the catering trade, tourism, commerce and
services.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the stock market and residents' increased
non-commodity expenditures such as that on medical care, insurance
and education, and a significant drop in institutional purchasing
power will result in a decline in the flow of money
into the consumer market, experts said.

The move is an effort to promote reforms in the government
official system, according to a press conference sponsored by the
municipal government yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The some 1,000 to-be-selected officials and high-level
technical personnel will be assigned to positions in charge of
industry, urban construction, commerce and trade, rural areas,
foreign trade, culture and education and health care.
</P>
<P>
The work of openly selecting officials includes three
steps: the first is a free application, along with a public
recommentation; the second is an in-person interview; and the
third, after a strict examination of candidates by the employer,
they will be appointed to positions on a one-year trial basis.
</P>
<P>
The candidates should be under 45 years in age, however, there
some positions for those under the age of 50. All of them should
have permanent residence registration and work experience in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Those with doctorates and masters' degrees obtained at foreign
countries will be given preference in this selection, without any
restriction on their residence registration.
</P>
<P>
Officials currently serving at central government's departments
will also enjoy preferential treatment in this competition,
according to the press conference.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the city selected five government officials at
bureau-chief level through public competition. In 1997, 56
government officials at the same level and advanced management
personnel were recruited in the same way.
</P>
<P>
All of these selected officials and personnel have executed
their responsibilities and reaped achievements in their positions,
according to yesterday's conference.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- In the first half of this year,
75 fishermen died or went missing in nearly 200 incidents in east
China sea, Bohai, Yellow, and South China seas, "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The accidents also injured 166 people, damaged 201 fishing
boats and sunk 26 others.
</P>
<P>
"The direct economic losses hit 8.97 million yuan (1.08 million
U.S. dollars), said Shen Jianrong, an official with the Bureau of
Fisheries under the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In east China Sea areas alone, casualties in the first six
months of this year were registered at 155, and at least 70 boats
were damaged or sank.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate report of casualties as Typhoon Otto hit
east China's Fujian Province yesterday.
</P>
<P>
On June 11, a leaking fishing boat from Guangdong's Zhanjiang
City sank with four people aboard; only one was rescued, the rest
were still missing.
</P>
<P>
"We have publicized the cases so that other people may draw
lessons from them," said Zhou Huiming, an official with the south

</P>
<P>
The bureau of fisheries has ordered all fishing enterprises to
conduct thorough safety inspections to nip in the bud any snags
that might cause accidents.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance provided 2 million yuan for the
maintenance and construction of the navigation marks as 46 percent
of them erected in 1985 in coastal regions for fishing purposes
have been totally destroyed due to natural or human causes.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Invest in Ports to Raise Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian authorities decided
Tuesday to invest heavily in building new ports and renovating
outdated ones to improve the handling capacity of ships, the
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a joint meeting between the Ministry
of Transport and the Ministry of Railroads.
</P>
<P>
The two ministries will first speed up the renovation of ports
in St. Petersburg and Novorossiysk as well as building three new
ports along the Gulf of Finland, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Along with the construction of facilities such as railways
leading to the ports, the projects will cost above one billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Due to the poor capacity of its own ports, Russia in recent
years has had to seek help from ports in neighboring countries to
handle goods.

<HEADLINE> Croatian, Slovenian Police Make Big Drug Haul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Croatian police, in a joint
operation with their Slovenian counterparts, seized 38 kilograms
of heroin and cut off a drug-trafficking route from Bosnia to West
Europe, a Croatian Interior Ministry official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The seized drug has a market value of 3.3 million U.S. dollars,
the official told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
A month ago, Slovenian police were tipped that a drug ring in
Slovenia was planning to ship an unknown amount of drugs from
Bosnia to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The information was quickly passed to Croatian police, who were
asked to intercept vehicles suspected to be involved in drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
On August 1, Croatian police stopped a vehicle at a checkpoint
and found the drug hidden in it.
</P>
<P>
The following day, with information provided by Croatian
police, Slovenian police arrested two people in connection with
the case in Ljubljana, capital of Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
In their homes, police found weapons and evidence allegedly
proving their hand in the case.
</P>
<P>
The heroin was destined for the Netherlands or Spain, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Polish Economy Shows Signs of a Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Polish economy grew by 6.7
percent in the first half of this year over the same period last
year, but it has started to show signs of a slowdown amid worries
over increasing trade deficit and inflation.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of the year, investment went up 23
percent, fueling the fast growth of the economy, while the
nation's unemployment rate dropped to 9.8 percent or 1.69 million,
the lowest since 1991.
</P>
<P>
But a slowdown in the second quarter of the year is threatening
the prospect for a continued economic expansion. The growth rate
of industrial output reached 10.9 percent in the first quarter.
However, it dropped to 6 percent in the second quarter. The growth
of housing sector also slowed down to 16.9 percent in the second
quarter from 25.4 percent in the first one.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade deficit hit 5.9 billion U.S. dollars in the first
half of the year and is expected reach 15.7 billion dollars by the
end of the year, an increase of 39 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the inflation rate had reached 12.2
percent. The government's goal of keeping inflation rate under 9.7
percent appeared to be difficult to achieve by the end of the
year, officials say.
</P>
<P>
The coal industry's output went down by 29.6 percent, compared
with the same period last year. Corporate profit margin dropped
from 1.8 percent in the first quarter to 1.3 percent in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Businesses all over the country borrowed more money, with their
foreign and domestic debt amounting to 50 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the first half of the year, Poland's total foreign debt
increased to about 40 billion dollars from last year's 38.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of speculative capital have poured into Poland
because of Russia's turbulent financial situation, the Asian
financial crisis and the continuing strength of the Polish
currency, the Zloty.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, foreign assets in Poland grew by
3 billion dollars, amounting to 26.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
With foreign reserve totaling 25 billion dollars, the Polish
authorities are guarding against a possible financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, U.S. Sign MOU on Disaster Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and the United States
have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for a five-year
Humanitarian Assistance Needs Assessment (HANA) project, media
reports here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The HANA project was reportedly to be aimed at helping the
Bangladeshi government minimize natural disaster-caused losses.
</P>
<P>
The MOU was signed here between the two sides on July 29, only
three days after Bangladesh refused to sign the Status of Forces
Agreement (SOFA) with the United States on the ground that SOFA
"would be detrimental to the national interest (of Bangladesh)."
</P>
<P>
Under the MOU, a 10-member team of the U.S. Defense Department
came to Bangladesh at the beginning of this month to "assess the
needs of the government to deal with the natural calamity and how
best the United States can contribute on this point," the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
After about three weeks' preliminary assessment, the U.S. team
would nominate projects and submit its recommendations to the
governments of the United States and Bangladesh, the reports
noted.
</P>
<P>
The projects will be undertaken only with the concurrence of
the two governments and each individual project taken up will have
a separate MOU, the reports added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Ready to Meet Congressmen, Says Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing
is ready to meet with U.S. Congressmen for face-to-face dialogue
on equal basis, said a Chinese diplomat here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li would like to have exchange with American
lawmakers on Capitol Hill, in the Chinese Embassy or even at his
residence to address mutual concerns and promote mutual
understanding, Counselor Zhang Keyuan told a press conference held
at the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
He, along with two other Chinese diplomats, were responding to
complaints made by Christopher Smith, chairman of the House
Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, about
Ambassador Li's absence from a scheduled meeting on human rights
in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ambassador initially agreed to participate in the
meeting. However, the meeting notice was announced as "hearing," a
term unacceptable to a formal representative from a sovereign
country.
</P>
<P>
Smith denied that neither his nor the Subcommittee's employee
had used the word. But the Chinese Embassy officials showed to
the reporters evidences which prompted the ambassador to change
his mind Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Things were made difficult for Ambassador Li to have the
scheduled dialogue with the Congressmen," said Hu Mingwu, the
Embassy counselor for Congressional liaison.
</P>
<P>
The Embassy issued a statement Tuesday evening, announcing that
Ambassador Li had agreed to a face-to-face dialogue on equal basis
with members of the Subcommittee on the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, in keeping with general diplomatic practice, it
is not appropriate for the Ambassador to appear as a witness
before the congressional subcommittee," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that he was informed that Ambassador Li would not
show up because the ground rules were broken only half an hour
before the event was scheduled. But Embassy Press Counselor Yu
Shuning said that it was not accurate and the embassy statement
was sent out Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Asked if a meeting could be arranged with Congressmen in the
days to come, Counselor Huo Mingwu said Ambassador Li has met with
60 Congressmen since he took up his post in Washington in
mid-March, and he is ready to meet more of them.
</P>
<P>
"The ambassador has good tea to entertain them here in the
Embassy or at his residence for a real dialogue not for TV show,
and we have nothing to hide and nothing to fear," said Counselor
Zhang.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Increase Technical Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) will increase technical assistance for health projects in
China by 1.5 million US dollars over the next two years, today's
"China Daily" quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Including the new funding, the country is expected to receive a
total of 14 million US dollars in technical support from the WHO
for 1998-99, the WHO's China office said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to support the improvement of primary
and community health care, in addition to sponsoring training
programmes for health administrators and medical workers.
</P>
<P>
There will also be co-operation in promoting safe blood and
blood products, traditional medicine, maternal and child health
and food safety.
</P>
<P>
The additional technical assistance is targeted mainly at poor
and rural areas of China, said Dr R.W.K. Gee, the WHO
representative in China.
</P>
<P>
Rural doctors in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region will receive
training to upgrade services. Malaria control and anti-smoking
schemes will be launched in the provinces of Yunnan and Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Work will be carried out in Hunan Province and the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region to prevent HIV/AIDS and
sexually-transmitted diseases and to build health education
schools.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the WHO Western Pacific Office and the Chinese
Ministry of Health met last week in Manila, the Philippines, to
review previous collaborations and discuss future plans.
</P>
<P>
This annual meeting- a high-level contact on health issues-was
launched in 1979. Its aim is to solve major problems in
implementing WHO-China co-operative projects and determine new
plans.
</P>
<P>
Dr, S.T. Han, WHO regional director of the Western Pacific area,
said he believed such conferences provide a very good opportunity
to look at how the two sides can best work together and ensure
that the WHO's limited resources are used with maximum efficiency
supporting priority health concerns in China.
</P>
<P>
The WHO, established in 1948, is the UN's largest special
agency. China was one of the initiators of the organization, which
currently has 191 member states.
</P>
<P>
China and the WHO resumed co-operation in 1972. Since then the
WHO has awarded scholarships to more than 1,400 Chinese medical
workers, granted 100 million US dollars in technical assistance,
and helped set up 68 WHO/China collaboration centres.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The remains of Lin Ti-chuan of
Taiwan are being transported from the Central Hospital of Haicheng
City in northeast China's Liaoning Province to Beijing in a hearse
provided by the Beijing-based Babaoshan Mortuary.
</P>
<P>
The hearse began its journey to Beijing around 6:00 a.m. this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Lin's younger brother and sister-in-law are accompanying the
hearse to Beijing in a car provided by the Haicheng city
government.
</P>

Lin's remains will undergo preliminary treatment in Beijing
before being transported to Hong Kong aboard Air China flight
CA101 on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Lin's remains are scheduled to be returned to Kaohsiung, Taiwan
at 4:45 p.m. the same day on a China Airlines flight, accompanied
by her family members.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ti-chuan was taken into custody unlawfully and subsequently

Straits. During the consultation, the Taiwanese Affairs Office of
the province learned that the family might ask to have Lin's
remains returned to Taiwan.

<P>
While in Haicheng, Lin's relatives and friends took part in
traditional Taiwanese religious services to mourn for Lin
Ti-chuan, with help and special permission from the local
government.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Pushes for Agricultural Mechanization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is striving for
mechanization of its agriculture by encouraging farmers to widely
use farm machinery and equipment in cultivation and introducing
both locally-produced and imported agricultural implements for the
purpose.
</P>
<P>
So far, 23 model mechanized agricultural villages have been
established across the country, according to an annual official
report on Myanmar's financial, economic and social conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government increased distribution of both local and
foreign-made farming implements to farmers in the country in the
1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March. In use were 36,200
tractors and power tillers for a total of 6 million hectares of
land, an increase of 2.7 million hectares over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Although Myanmar has made some achievements in agricultural
mechanization, the majority of its land is still cultivated with
draft and cattle.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the number of draft cattle was 3.5
million yokes in 1997-98, increasing by 83,000 yokes over a year
earlier. The average cultivated area by a yoke of draft cattle was
3.07 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar gives first priority to the production of farm
machinery and equipment by the country's manufacturing sector
during the present five-year plan period (1996-97 to 2000-2001).
</P>
<P>
According to a promulgation of the Myanmar Ministry of Commerce
in April, agricultural implements are also among the 14
first-priority goods designated for import.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Myanmar's agriculture, the
mainstay of its economy traditionally accounting for 35 to 40
percent of the gross domestic product and 35 percent of the
export, grew by 2.9 percent in its output value in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The country's rice production in the fiscal year was 17.3
million tons, of which 28,300 tons were exported.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices in Italy were stable
in July, leaving the yearly inflation rate at 1.8 percent, the

<P>
Istat said the average inflation rate over the past 12 months

</P>
<P>
The data showed that the biggest monthly price rises were for
health goods and services, especially medicines (up 0.7 percent),
while the prices of clothing, footwear, furniture, transport,
education and domestic services remained stable.
</P>
<P>
Housing and other accommodation prices dropped 0.2 percent, as
did water, electricity and energy prices.
</P>
<P>
Hotel, restaurant and bar prices fell 0.1 percent, along with
the prices of foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
But over the year, the biggest price rises were for health
goods and services, up three percent, followed by clothing,
footwear, entertainment and cultural events, which rose 2.7
percent, and accommodation, water, electricity and energy prices,
which increased 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks in Thailand Offered 5-Year Guarantee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand, the
country's central bank, has agreed to offer foreign banks that
take a major stake in Thai financial institutions a five-year
guarantee on their investments.
</P>
<P>
Kitti Patpongpibul, deputy governor of the central bank, was
quoted by Thursday's Bangkok Post as saying the guarantee would
help draw badly needed foreign capital for banks and finance
companies.
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the central bank is proposing to buy back the
shares at the same price originally paid by the foreign strategic
partners, at any point during the first five years of their
involvement with the local banks and finance institutions.
</P>
<P>
Details are yet to be worked out and the offer would also be
extended to foreign banks that have already made deals locally,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kitti, numerous foreign institutions were
interested in local banks, but were not sure of the market and
economic risks.
</P>
<P>
Thai financial institutions are under great pressure to raise
new capital to account for declining asset quality and the need
for higher provisions.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans are estimated at up to 35 percent of the 5
trillion baht (125 billion U.S. dollars) in total credit
outstanding. The sector needs at least 20 billion dollars in new
capital over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
Until now, only three local banks -- Bangkok Bank, Thai Farmers
Bank and Thai Danu Bank -- have successfully completed
recapitalization while the Bank of Asia expects to receive payment
for its share sale to ABN-Amro by next month.

<HEADLINE> WNBA Players Opt for Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A majority of WNBA players
agreed to form a union and have selected the embattled NBA Players
Assocation (NBPA) to represent them.
</P>
<P>
The NBPA already has presented WNBA officials with a request to
begin formal negotiations, said NBPA executive director Billy
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we've received signed union cards from close to 100 of
the 120 WNBA players since our organizing drive began about four
weeks ago," he noted, "It presents us with a clear mandate to
begin negotiating with a WNBA on behalf of these players and we
are delighted to have the opportunity to do so."
</P>
<P>
Hunter and the NBPA have done little negotiating with the NBA
since the league imposed a lockout on June 30th. He will join
other union representatives Thursday in New York for face-to-face
talks with NBA officials. The meeting will be the first between
the sides since the players association filed an unfair practice
charge with the National Labor Relations Board, claiming the
lockout is illegal.
</P>
<P>
"This union will be driven by the players' agenda, above all
else," Hunter said, referring to the WNBA entity.
</P>
<P>
Agent Bruce Levy, who represents more than 30 WNBA
players,said:"We are very pleased that the WNBA is as successful
as it has been, and we feel that the time has come to ensure that
the players receive their fair share of the benefits that derive
from the success. The players have decisively concluded that the
NBPA is the organization that can convert that potential into
promise."

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A piece of saline-alkaline and
straw-scattered land here and there on the plains has been the
major property of the people of Hangmin Village for thousands of
years.
</P>
<P>
However, local villagers have put an end to such a life through
hard work over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
They have built multi-storey apartment buildings surrounded by
trees and flowers instead of straw. By the end of last year,
Hangmin Village in Xiaoshan City in east China's Zhejiang Province,
had established 18 joint and cooperative industrial and commercial
enterprises and firms funded by the village itself, and three
farms.
</P>
<P>
The village, with a population of 1,067, now boasts total
assets of 770 million yuan (92.77 million U.S. dollars) in
industrial sales, and the annual per capita income of local people
was nearly 10,000 yuan (1,205 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The per capita income for local villagers was only 148 yuan
(17.83 U.S .dollars) only 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the village set up its first enterprise -- a bleaching
and dyeing plant. In 1982, net profits of the plant exceeded 1
million yuan (120,400 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hangmin people made a wise choice and invested the money in
expanding production in order to realize even greater profits.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Chongqing, board chairman of the Hangmin Industrial Group,
said his group is now engaged in textiles, printing and dyeing,
chemicals and electricity, as well as hotels, department stores
and real estate.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hiroshima on Thursday commemorated
the 53rd anniversary of the atomic bombing of the Japanese city,
with citizens praying for those who died from the blast.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshima citizens began arriving at the Peace Memorial Park
before dawn to offer prayers for those who died.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Hiroshima Mayor Takashi Hiraoka
and other dignitaries and representatives gathered at the park for
the Peace Memorial Ceremony, and laid flowers at the stone
cenotaph to the bomb victims.
</P>
<P>
At 8:15, the exact time of the blast, participants at the
ceremony offered one minute of silent prayer, while a bell
symbolizing peace sounded throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Hiraoka dedicated a new list of 4,927 names of atomic
bomb victims who have died since August 6 last year, bringing the
total number of deaths to 207,045.
</P>
<P>
Hiraoka delivered a peace declaration, urging the international
community to start immediate negotiations on a treaty to ban the
use of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"All countries should immediately initiate negotiations on a
treaty for the non-use of nuclear weapons as one step on the road
to these (nuclear) weapons' total abolition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following a peace pledge delivered by primary school children,
1,500 doves, the symbol of peace, were released into the sky.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely deplorable that India and Pakistan conducted
nuclear tests in May this year," Obuchi said in his speech.
</P>
<P>
"Our government strongly urges both the Indian and Pakistani
governments to immediately stop nuclear tests and unconditionally
conclude the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, to stop the
development of nuclear weapons and their transportation means
which are missiles, and to unconditionally conclude the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also vowed that Japan would continue to stick to and
strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation system, and make further
progress on nuclear weapon states' nuclear disarmament. He said he
believeed this to be Japan's utmost mission.
</P>
<P>
The atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima in southwest Japan on
August 6, 1945, by a United States B-29 bomber Enola Gay. An
estimated 140,000 people had died in the world's first nuclear
attack by the end of that year.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Forecasts Oil Price Fall in Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The prices of Venezuelan oil will
continue to drop in the international market and will remain below
13 U.S. dollars per barrel for the next three years, the
state-owned petroleum company, PDVSA, said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The company predicts that the country's oil production ceiling
would be 6.2 million barrels per day for the year 2006 and 5.8
million barrels for 2008.
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the price declines to the Asian
financial crisis, the return of Iraq to the international oil
market and the warmest winter in the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The average price of Venezuelan oil could reach 12.5 dollars
per barrel this year compared to 1997's 16.49 dollars per barrel,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, Mexico and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement in March
to reduce their production each by 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per
day to cope with the oil price crisis.

Zhang, formerly director of the Hangmin Village Bleaching and
Dyeing Plant, disclosed that his group's employees are not only
local young and middle-aged villagers, but also include over 5,000
workers from other places to meet production demands.
</P>
<P>
What makes this one different from other villages in China is
that Hangmin villagers have no contracted farmland or private
plots, however they are not worried about their vegetable
baskets.
</P>
<P>
That's because 18 young and middle-aged villagers are
responsible for farming the village's 53 hectares of arable
land, and the production of non-staple foods for the whole village.
</P>
<P>
At present, village education has no tuition fees for
kindergarten through secondary school. Elderly people over the age
of 55 get a 60-yuan monthly pension, and retired workers receive
70 percent of their former salaries.
</P>
<P>
Village leaders have not forgotten to enrich the cultural lives
of the villagers, said Zhu Chongqing. Two years ago, the village
used 12 million yuan (1.45 million U.S. dollars) to build a
cultural center which includes ballrooms, a library, reading
rooms, a theater, and swimming pools. Villagers usually visit the
center in the evening.
</P>
<P>
These remarkable achievements have attracted attention at
home and abroad. Many people, including President Jiang Zemin, have
visited Hangmin Village.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, a United Nations official visited the
village and said Hangmin could rival any developed village in the
world.

BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Safety has become a problem for
people in the fishing industry in China, government authorities
warn.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, there were 198 accidents at
sea, 201 fishing boats were involved in wrecks, and over 200
fishermen were hurt and about 9 million yuan (1 million
U.S. dollars) in losses totalled up.
</P>
<P>
Officials say the situation is getting worse because of a
neglect of safety procedures by both managers and fishermen, a
relaxation in law enforcement, and the low technical level of the
industry. The abnormal weather conditions this year are also being
blamed.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture's Fishery Department recently
issued a notice telling industry officials across the country to
increase safety awareness on fishing boats and to improve safety
inspections on fishing boats.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Export
Promotion in Thailand is staging trade exhibitions on the Internet
as a new way to publicize Thai products to the world market, The
Bangkok Post said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, gems and jewelry will be the first
sector featured, with extensive previews of the Bangkok Gems and
Jewelry Fair, scheduled for September 9-12.
</P>
<P>
The department has invested 600,000 baht (15,000 U.S. dollars)
to develop the new Web site: .
</P>
<P>
Director-General Sanit Vorapanya of the department said that
more than 50 million people use the Internet worldwide and that
many have high purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cost of organizing an on-line trade show, which
would be available 24 hours a day, is much lower than for a live
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Sanit said Thai exporters should improve their knowledge of
information technology since the Internet is becoming many
consumers' primary source of information.
</P>
<P>
The next sector to be featured on the site would be leather
goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Komson Opassathavorn, president of the Thai Gem and
Jewellry Traders Association, applauded the project, saying all
400 members of the association have participated in the project.
</P>
<P>
Exporters might also develop their own site soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism about the effectiveness of the promotion,
particularly in the United States, Thailand's largest market for
gems and jewellry exports, since 70 percent of the world's
Internet users live in that country.

in central China's Hunan Province has made an effort to protect its
historical relics in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The city has 1,700 historical sites and nearly 10,000 relics,

protection project, repairing ancient buildings like the Liuzi
Temple and the Huilong Pagoda, and removing 10,000 sq.m. of
illegal residential or office buildings from the historical sites.

<HEADLINE> Manila May Ease Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Buoyed by a decline in the
inflation rate last month, the monetary authorities have vowed to
adopt certain leniency in the management of the country's monetary
policy to stimulate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin Thursday quoted Central Bank Governor Gabriel
Singson as saying the July inflation rate had bolstered the
likelihood that the average inflation rate can be kept to
single-digit this year.
</P>
<P>
The government announced Wednesday a 10.6-percent year-on-year
inflation in July, down from 10.7 percent the previous month,
bringing the average inflation for the first seven months to 9.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Singson said an indication that inflation had reached its peak
was the month-on-month change rate of only 0.3 percent in July
compared to the 1.7 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent change of tack, Singson declared Wednesday that
"greater flexibility" in monetary growth may be assured because of
the more favorable prospects in inflation.
</P>
<P>
This stance is a reversal of its previous tack of prudent
monetary management which has characterized the monetary policy in
the past year since the regional currency crisis hit the
Philippines seriously.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the strong resolve of the monetary authorities to
relax their grip on monetary management was bolstered not only by
the reduction in the inflation rate but also by the
overperformance in the level of the central bank's net
international reserves.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned Over Congo's Deteriorating Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Wednesday
urged neighbors of the Democratic Republic of Congo not to
involved in widening the country's revolt against President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is concerned by reports that Rwandan troops are
involved in military operations ... in support of a Congolese
military rebellion against President Kabila," State Department
spokesman James Foley said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
"We urge all countries in the region to respect the territorial
integrity of the Congo, refrain from becoming involved in the
conflict and respect international law," he said.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Congo was reported to be deteriorating as
revolt against President Kabila deepened on Wednesday with his
foreign minister defecting to the rebels and fighting was reported
in the country's third city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the United States was concerned over the
deteriorating security situation there and especially by instances
of the arrest and harassment of Congolese citizens of ethnic Tutsi
origin.
</P>
<P>
The White House said on Tuesday that Washington was in touch
with regional African countries to assess what was going on in
Congo and how to prevent the conflict from widening. And African
leaders planned to meet in Zimbabwe on Friday to discuss the
revolt, which President Kabila blamed on estranged ally Rwanda and
members of Congo's ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge community.
</P>
<P>
The State Department has ordered all nonessential U.S. embassy
workers to leave Congo and warned U.S. citizens against traveling
to the country.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Urged to Keep Prudency in Dispute With Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican politicians have
urged their government to be prudent in handling a dispute with
neighboring Nicaragua over right of navigation on the San Juan
border river between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We should not nourish polemics that concern only to
Nicaraguans," the former government vice minister Jose Manuel
Gutierrez said wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Another former government vice minister, Fernando Naranjo, said
that the matter should be handled very carefully and with no
prejudices.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez said on Wednesday
that he expects to give a big hug to Nicaraguan President Arnoldo
Aleman when they meet in Colombia next Friday, according to media
reports here.
</P>
<P>
Under relevant treaties, the 300-kilometer section of the river
that separates Costa Rica from Nicaragua is under Nicaragua's
sovereignty. Costa Rica has the right of free navigation through
this waterway. However, the treaties have not specified whether
the navigation right covers armed Costa Rican officers patroling
the river.
</P>
<P>
The latest dispute between the two countries flared up almost a
month ago when Nicaraguan authorities prohibited members of the
Costa Rican Public Force to circulate around with weapons.
</P>
<P>
Despite the signing of an agreement last week by the Ministry
of Public Security of Costa Rica and the Nicaraguan Ministry of
Defense, the dispute has relapsed.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Nicaragua suspended free navigation following a
heavy deployment of military personnel by Costa Rica.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The average life
expectancy for Colombians will be 71.68 years of age from 1998 to

Statistics Administrative Department (DANE).
</P>
<P>
The data show that men's life expectancy will be 68.6, while

The DANE attributed the age gap between men and women to
military violence and social conflict, which affects more men than
women.

Based on the 1993 census, the DANE forecast is that Colombia's
population will reach 40.826 million in 1998, 20.177 million will
be men, 20.485 million will be women.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japanese Military Atlases Found in Sichuan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 6 (Xinhua)-- Two Japanese military atlases, the
"Pocket Atlas of China" and the "Pocket Atlas of Manchuria" have
been found here, providing new evidence of Japanese militarists'
aggressive ambitions for China during World War II, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The "Pocket Atlas of China" was issued by a publishing house in
Tokyo on June 20, 1941, according to its back cover. It includes
13 maps, each 14.5 centimeters (cm) long and 8 cm wide.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and northeast China's three provinces -- Heilongjiang,
Jilin and Liaoning -- are not included on any maps in the atlas.
</P>
<P>
The same-sized "Pocket Atlas of Manchuria" with eight maps, was
issued on Oct. 5, 1940, by the same publishing house. It divided
the three northeast provinces into 19 "provinces" with the
"capital" marked in Xinjing, now called Changchun in Jilin
Province.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time an "Atlas of Manchuria" has been found in
China, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The two atlases are now in the possession of Li Jinxing,
director of the Automatic-control Meters Plant in Wenjiang
County, Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Li happened to find the atlases as he was packaging his
father's books.
</P>
<P>
He said that his father seized these two atlases in 1945 from
Japanese soldiers in a battle in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Early this June, a similar military atlas was found in Liaoning
Province.

WASHINGTON -- The United States said on Wednesday that it was
waiting to assess Iraq's actions after its parliament voted to
freeze U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's national Assembly voted unanimously to suspend
U.N. weapons inspections. The move has yet to be endorsed by Iraqs
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said the vote by Iraq's
parliament amounted to "political rhetoric," and Washington would
"watch Iraqi actions, not their words." (US-Iraq-Weapons

BAGHDAD -- Iraq announced Wednesday to suspend cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors until conditions it sets are met, a strong
effort believed designed to see the eight-year-old U.N. sanctions
on it lifted early.
</P>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein made the decision soon after a
parliament special session called on the Iraqi leaders to stop
cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said the president decided to
"immediately and completely suspend" cooperation with both the
U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq, known as UNSCOM, and
the International Atomic Energy Agency. (Iraq-UN 4th lead

<HEADLINE> Joblessness Soars in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in New Zealand
hit its highest level in four years in the second quarter of this
year and is expected to worsen as the economic recession takes its
toll, according to government statistics published Thursday by The
Dominion.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that the unemployment rate soared to 7.7
percent of the working population in the second quarter from 6.6
percent a year earlier. An estimated 143,000 were out of work
during the three months to June this year, including 79,000 men
and 64,000 women.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted New Zealand Employment
Minister Peter McCardle as saying the rise in unemployment "was
not unexpected" because of the Asian economic decline.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Asia used to take a third of New
Zealand's exports.
</P>
<P>
McCardle said positive economic growth was expected through
next year, helped particularly by a lower New Zealand dollar,
lower interest rates and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion also quoted some economists as saying they
expected 163,000 to be jobless by next March, with the
unemployment rate peaking at 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
A rise to 8.5 percent would put New Zealand ahead of Australia
(8.2 percent), Britain (6.3 percent), the United States (4.5
percent) and Japan (4.3 percent).

<HEADLINE> European Super League at Horizon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A new European competition format
Super League is at the horizon after announcements from the
region's soccer governing body UEFA and top clubs Manchester
United, Arsenal and Ajax Amsterdam on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
UEFA, for the first time since reports of a proposed league
surfaced two weeks ago, said that it had its own projects for a
new competition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, such top clubs as two former European champions
Manchester United, Ajax and current English champions Arsenal also
admitted publicly for the first time they were involved in
discussion for a breakaway midweek competition.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Wednesday, UEFA spokesman Frits
Ahlstrom said:"The fact Manchester United made this announcement
today is not news for us. We have known all about United's
involvement for some time."
</P>
<P>
"But we have also been working on our own plans for a new
competition. We have a clear idea of how the competition should
be organised and I think they will be met very positively."
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes changes do not happen as fast as we would like, but
I think that our plans could be made public at the next UEFA
Executive Committee meeting in Lisbon on October 6."
</P>
<P>
"The keyword for us is the supporter. That is absolutely
crucial for UEFA. There is no point in having matches played in
empty stadiums, even for television and we have to make it right
for the supporter."
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Manchester United confirmed in a
statement issued through the London Stock Exchange that they were
involved in talks concerning the Super League which would bring
together the top 16 clubs in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Ajax also admitted earlier that they had also been involved in
talks. Both Manchester United and Ajax also confirmed that they
were committed to remaining in their domestic leagues. Arsenal
issued a similar statement on the day.
</P>
<P>
Spanish clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid, Italian champions
Juventus, Inter Milan and AC Milan are all expected to make their
involvement public soon.

<HEADLINE> Plain-clothes Police to Act Against Cricket Hooligans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Plain-clothes police and video
surveillance will be used for the first time to prevent cricket
hooliganism at the fifth Test between England and South Africa at
Headingley.
</P>
<P>
The new techniques are similar to those used by their
colleagues in the National Football Intelligence Unit.
</P>
<P>
The match commander for police operations, Inspector David
Boyle, said there was "increasing evidence that people are
attending in order to extend their football xenophobia within
cricket".
</P>
<P>
"We have seen this in the wearing of football strips, the
football banners in the crowd and the organised chanting which has
been seen at cricket."
</P>
<P>
During the first Test at Edgbaston, more than 100 people were
ejected and there were complaints about the behaviour of people
drinking.
</P>
<P>
At the third Test in Old Trafford, drinking was banned for the
first time at a test match. People wearing dress which officials
considered offensive or hats, wigs and headdresses which could
block views were also barred.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be killjoys," said Chris Hassell, the chief
executive of Yorkshire Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
"Fancy dress is perfectly acceptable so long as it is not
outrageous and does not block the view of people behind," he
said.

committed to the FA premier league and other domestic competitions
and is very mindful of its responsibilities to the governing

The talk of a new breakaway league has attracted the attention
from UEFA, European soccer's ruling body, and the FA premier
league.
</P>

United, the dominant force in English club soccer for much of
the 1990s, stressed that there was no question of the club
committing to a new competition until "all appropriate
consultations have taken place".

But United, the most successful of Britain's growing band of

projects that might prove to its financial advantage.

"Football is a developing industry and we have a duty to
examine any serious proposal that we feel might be beneficial to
Manchester United, its fans and shareholders and football
generally," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Stay for Briefing by Chief Arms Inspector </HEADLINE>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has postponed his travel plan for 24 hours in order to
participate in Thursday's Security Council consultations on Iraq,
his spokesman announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan will be present during the briefing by chief U.N. arms
inspector Richard Butler, who came back on Wednesday after his
talks with the Iraqi Government on Iraq's disarmament broke down
early this week.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced on Wednesday to suspend cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors until conditions it sets are met. The move was
seen as an effort for the early lifting of the eight-year U.N.
sanctions on Iraq, imposed since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who has been scheduled to go to Lisbon on Thursday to
attend the opening ceremony of the World Conference of Ministers
Responsible for Youth, said the Security Council will hear
Butler's briefing before taking further steps in arms inspection
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Declining to see the latest developments with Iraq as a crisis,
Butler said he has instructed his arms teams in Baghdad to
continue their normal work.

<HEADLINE> Seven Killed in Berlin House Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of seven bodies have been
recovered from the rubble of a collapsed apartment house in Berlin
until Wednesday evening after a suspected gas explosion destroyed
the house early Tuesday morning, German rescue workers said.
</P>
<P>
The seven dead were all those who were reported missing after
the four-storey apartment house in a western district of Berlin
collapsed at about 6:00 a.m. Tuesday after a huge explosion,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The victims included a 13-year-old boy whose parents have
survived the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of rescue workers, helped by specially trained dogs
and high-tech detecting devices, have been working round the clock
to remove the rubble by hand in a bid to search for possible
survivors.
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 registered tenants of the apartment house, some dug
themselves out of the debris and several others were found not in
the house when the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that rescue workers would continue to clear up
the rubble until Thursday in order to make sure there were no
unexpected victims.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that the explosion might have been triggered
by a gas leak in the basement of the building, but the exact cause
could only be made clear in days or weeks.

<HEADLINE> Butler Mystified by Iraq's Acton of Suspending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler, executive
chairman of the United Nations Special Commission in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said Wednesday he
was puzzled by Iraq's blunt action to suspend the arms talks when
resolution of several issues was near.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon returning to the Headquarters of the
United Nations in New York from Baghdad, Butler said that in the
areas of missiles and chemical weapons, U.N. inspectors were very
close to being able to declare that Iraq has complied with
relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We were getting there. If it was a five-lap race, we were
halfway into the fifth lap. Why stop the race when you are getting
towards the finish line?" Butler said.
</P>
<P>
But Butler said that in the area of biological weapons, Iraq's
complying with U.N. resolutions was in bad shape, and a lot more
was needed.
</P>
<P>
"What is really sad about all this is that missiles and
chemical weapons were in pretty good shape. We need some more
evidence to close them down," he said.
</P>
<P>
Butler said Iraq had the power to escape the sweeping sanctions
imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 by proving to the
United Nations that it had destroyed all its prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
Butler, who cut his visit to Iraq, will brief U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his talks with Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz which broke down Monday due to sharp
differences between them. He is scheduled to brief the Security
Council Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Reject Democrats' Plan on 2000 Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives voted on Wednesday against allowing statistical
sampling in the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-controlled chamber rejected, 227-201, a
Democrats' proposal to keep the door open for sampling. The vote
ensured that the battle will continue into the fall or beyond,
because President Bill Clinton has threatened to veto the spending
bill containing census provisions. The Senate-approved version of
the measure sidesteps the issue.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and the Democrats want the Census Bureau, as it had
planned, to use sampling to help tally hard-to-reach Americans,
disproportionate numbers of whom are minorities who tend to vote
Democratic. Republicans argue that sampling is unreliable and
would let the Clinton administration manipulate the figures to
Democrats' advantage.
</P>
<P>
Census data, gathered every decade as required by the
Constitution, is used to redraw House district lines and to
distribute hundreds of billions in federal spending.
</P>
<P>
Republicans raised doubts about the admistration's
trustworthiness while Democrats accused Republicans of wanting to
undercount minorities.
</P>
<P>
After its 1990 head-count, the Census Bureau estimated that it
had fallen short of the actual population by about four million
people, or just below two percent. The bureau said unusually high
undercounts occurred among blacks, Hispanics, Asians and American
Indians.
</P>
<P>
To avoid a recurrence, the bureau has planned to use sampling.
Under the technique, workers would visit many homes whose
residents had failed to return census forms, and use that
information to extrapolate totals for each state.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Rwandan President
Posteur Bizimingu Wednesday reiterated that his country has not
been involved in the on-going fightings in the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during an official meeting at the State House here
with his counterpart President Frederick Chiluba, Bizimingu
stressed that Rwanda has no reason to get involved and said it is
regrettable development that this region gets involved in a lot
of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being there is no particular reason for Rwanda
to be involved in the internal situation of Congo (Kinshasa),"
said Bizimingu.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan president, accompanied by the First Lady and four
cabinet ministers, arrived in Zambia Wednesday morning for a
three-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Kinshasa Tuesday accused its former ally Rwanda
of invading the country and called on the U.N Security Council to
order an immediate retreat of the troops that invaded its
territory.
</P>
<P>
And on Monday, Congoleses President Laurent Kabila's
government urged its neighbors to resist the temptation to
involve themselves in an army rebellion in the east of the
republic. The rebellion followed Kabila's order to send Rwandan
soldiers back to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
In a clear reference to the soldiers from the Rwandan
Patriotic Army which helped Kabila to oust late dictator Muboto
Sese Seko last year, Presidential Affairs Minister Pierre Victor
Mpoyo charged on the state television that the rebellion has been
planned for some time by foreign officers who were ordered home
last week.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis Affects U.S. Manufacturing and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Asian crisis is taking a
toll on the U.S. manufacturers and farmers, but strong domestic
consumer demand is contributing to push the overall economic
growth, the Federal Reserve reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Fed report found widespread evidence that Asia's troubles
were cutting into demand for the U.S manufactured goods and
depressing the prices of many farm commodities.
</P>
<P>
But even with these adverse effects, the 12 Fed districts
"generally indicate a high level of economic activity," the
central bank said in its latest snapshot of economic conditions
around the country.
</P>
<P>
The latest report said that economic activity had been
depressed in the second quarter, not only by Asia but also by the
U.S. No. 1 auto-maker--- the GM's strike, which was settled last
week.
</P>
<P>
It said the Atlanta, Chicago, Richmond, New York and St. Louis
districts had all reported declines in manufacturing employment
due to the GM strike with Asia's impact widespread as well.
</P>
<P>
"Weakness in Asia and increased low-cost imports (from that
region) continued to depress activity for a variety of U.S.
products," the Fed survey found. "Manufacturers reported that
sales and orders for apparel and textiles, computing equipment,
electronic components, industrial machinery, paper and wood
products fell in many districts."
</P>
<P>
The Asian impact on the farm sector has been evident in falling
prices for many crops as recessions in many nations in that part
of the world have contributed to lower demand.
</P>
<P>
"Price declines for some commodities have been so large that
producers cannot cover costs," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Adding to farmers' troubles from Asia, the Fed noted severe
droughts across the South that destroyed crops and damaged pasture
land for cattle.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Fed reported that consumer demand has remained
strong and low mortgage rates have contributed to a boom in
housing sales and construction.
</P>
<P>
The latest economic report seemed to underscore worries on the
inflation front, noting that all regions of the country were
reporting tight labor markets.
</P>
<P>
"Labor shortages were broad-based and some skilled workers were
in especially short supply," the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts believe that stable inflation so far this year
will allow the Fed to remain the interest rate on hold until more
is known about the Asian crisis impact on the U.S. economy.

<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cairo-based Arab League
Secretariat expressed the hope Wednesday that current peace
negotiations between Khartoum and opposition factions would
realize peace and put an end to Sudan's 15-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat said in a statement that it is closely
following up the ongoing peace negotiations between the government
and southern rebels in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa under
the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
The Arab forum underlined its stance calling for maintaining
the unity of Sudan and asked all parties to respond to appeals by
the international community to stop fighting so that humanitarian
aid can reach the regions affected by the war in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, during the current round of talks, which began
on Tuesday and are expected to end Thursday, have reportedly
agreed to discuss details of an internationally supervised vote on
self-determination for the south.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) has been fighting for
autonomy of the south from the north since 1983. Fightings
combined with perennial famines have claimed more than 1.5 million
lives.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the two sides declared a three-month ceasefire in
the southwestern famine-stricken Bahr al-Ghazal province to
expedite delivery of relief food. On the eve of the talks, Sudan
expanded its cease-fire areas, which rebuffed by the SPLA as a
publicity stint.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The 11-country euro zone
registered a better economic development trend than the 15-nation
European Union in July, the European Commission said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The trend was reported as a result of the business and consumer
survey conducted by the commission's Directorate General for
economic and financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
Economic sentiment in both the euro zone and the European Union
improved in July compared with a month earlier. The euro zone saw
an increase of 0.7 percent while the union had an increase of 0.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence increased in the euro zone whereas it
remained stable in the EU as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France both posted marked improvement in the
consumer's confidence indicator each with a 4-percentage-point
increase.
</P>
<P>
The euro zone includes Belgium, Germany, France, Italy,
Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Spain and
Portugal. EU member states Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece
did not join the single currency mechanism that is scheduled to be
inaugurated next January.

<HEADLINE> Moldova, Gazprom Start Talks on Gas Debt Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The government of Moldova and
Russia's oil and gas giant Gazprom began talks Wednesday on
Kishinev's debts to gas supplies.
</P>
<P>
The discussions will focus on the rescheduling of the debt of
more than 300 million U.S. dollars, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Most of the debt is owed by the Dniester region, which provides
power supply to the whole former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
Moldova is considering offering Gazprom another package of
bonds worth 80-90 million U.S. dollars at an annual interest rate
of 7.5 percent, and shares in a joint venture to be created with
Gazprom, Vice Prime Minister Ion Sturza said following his talks
with Gazprom in Moscow last July.
</P>
<P>
However, Sturza said, the creation of the joint venture could
be complicated by the Dniester region's demand for a debt amnesty
in exchange for the unhindered removal of Russian weapons and
property from its territory.
</P>
<P>
The former 14th Russian army was stationed in Dniester.
</P>
<P>
Moldova consumes an annual 3 billion cubic meters of Russian
gas and about 40 percent goes to the Dniester power plant.
</P>
<P>
It had already transferred 140 million U.S. dollars worth of
bonds to Gazprom in 1997 for seven years at 7.5 percent per annum
as debt payments, Tass said.

<HEADLINE> Monica Lewinsky Reportedly to Testimony Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky is prepared to testify to grand jurors -- probably
on Thursday -- in the White House scandal, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Security at the courthouse where the grand jury meets was
notably heightened in preparation for the expected testimony of
Lewinsky, who is at the center of the sex and perjury allegations.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky, who has been preparing for her testimony with her own
lawyers and members of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's legal
team, was to meet with prosecutors on Wednesday. She will testify
under a grant of immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
News reports quoted unidentified sources as saying her
testimony, though not absolutely confirmed for Thursday, was "99
percent" sure to be on that date.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky is the star witness in the investigation that has even
brought talk of possible impeachment, particularly over
suggestions that U.S. President Bill Clinton obstructed justice by
trying to hide an affair, allegedly carried on in the White House.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky reportedly is prepared to testify that she and Clinton
had a sexual relationship and that, while she was never explicitly
told to lie about it, it was understood that the affair would be
kept quiet.
</P>
<P>
Both Clinton and Lewinsky have denied the affair under oath in
statements in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, and Clinton
has said publicly he never asked anyone to lie.
</P>
<P>
One piece of evidence -- a dark blue dress -- provided by
Lewinsky allegedly has a stain that was being analyzed by FBI
technicians for physical evidence that could link it to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton, who is scheduled to testimony by video to
the grand jury on August 17, is keeping a busy political agenda
and met with the House Democratic Caucus to discuss Social
Security, health care and education. The scandal was not mentioned
and Clinton was warmly received.

<HEADLINE> German Economic Growth Sets to Continue, Institute Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The economic upswing in Germany
would continue at least until 1999 and is expected to have
positive impact on the job market, the German Ifo economic
research institute predicted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest economic forecast issued by the
Munich-based institute on Wednesday, Germany is expected to see an
economic growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"If the framework conditions are improved further, the upswing
could continue for a long time," said Ifo's chief economist, Willi
Leibfritz.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the sustained economic growth, Germany's jobless
total was expected to be cut by 575,000 to around four million by
the end of 1999, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
The Ifo institute on Wednesday also viewed the continuing Asian
financial crisis as a risk factor for Germany's economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
"Without the Asian crisis we would probably see an economic
growth of three percent," Leibfritz said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Ifo economist did not see any negative impact on
the German economy from the single European currency, the euro,
which is due to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"At least in the first year the euro will be a strong baby," he
said.

UNITED NATIONS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Wednesday complained
to the United Nations over Kuwait's halt and inspection of the
ships taking foodstuffs to Iraq and called upon the United Nations
to stop Kuwait from doing so.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. secretary-general, Iraq's Foreign

Iraq, to ensure they complied with U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the action of Kuwait's coast guards
"has no legal basis and thus constitutes an unmitigated act of
hostility" that was incompatible with Security Council resolutions
establishing a cease-fire at the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf said in the letter that Iraq "reserves its right to take
action, at the appropriate time, to defend the rights and

KAMPALA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- About 16 percent of the new-born
babies in Uganda are those whose mothers are proved to be
HIV-positive, a Ugandan AIDS Commission official told Xinhua here

</P>
<P>
Children borne to HIV positive mothers face deprivation,
stigmatization and discrimination, she added.
</P>
<P>
Since most of the parents suffering AIDS die at an earlier
age, their children are forced to take the heavy burden of the
family by taking care of the younger siblings, leading to
creation of children-headed households.
</P>
<P>
The orphaned children are prone to be exposed to sexual abuse,
harassment and sometimes loss of property.
</P>
<P>
The children are too young to protect their property after the
death of the HIV positive parents. Their properties are often
taken away of other members of the big family.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Suspends Cooperation With U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq announced Wednesday to
suspend cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors until conditions
it sets are met, a strong effort believed designed to see the
eight-year-old U.N. sanctions on it lifted early.
</P>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein made the decision soon after a
parliament special session called on the Iraqi leaders to stop
cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a joint meeting of the powerful
Revolutionary Command Council and the ruling Baath Party chaired
by Saddam.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said the president decided to
"immediately and completely suspend" cooperation with both the
U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq, known as UNSCOM, and
the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
One of the conditions set is the recomposition of UNSCOM. Iraq
demands equal representation of the member states of the Security
Council on the Special Commission, and Iraq's participation in
UNSCOM work as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Another one is to move UNSCOM headquarters to Geneva from New
York with an aim to keep the Commission away from the U.S. direct
influence.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also asks for a rotation of UNSCOM chairmanship among the
five permanent members of the Security Council, which means Iraq
wants the removal of UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler from his
position.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused UNSCOM and Butler as U.S. stooges in Washington's
drive to intentionally prolong the sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Iraq reiterates that it has fulfilled all its
obligations toward relevant U.N. resolutions and that all its
prohibited weapons have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The statement accuses UNSCOM of being dishonest and unfair when
handling disarmament issues in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It also calls on the United Nations to respect Iraq's
sovereignty and legitimate rights, saying it reserves the right to
dispel any weapons inspector violating such rights.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made when Iraq has repeated several times that
the sanctions must be lifted in the near future.
</P>
<P>
However, the sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait can only be lifted when U.N. inspectors verify that the
country is free of chemical, biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of UNSCOM-Iraq talks on the issue collapsed
last Monday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Assessing Iraq's Actions on Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that it was waiting to assess Iraq's actions after its
parliament voted to freeze U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's national Assembly, meeting after chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler cut short a visit to Baghdad on Tuesday,
voted unanimously to suspend U.N. weapons inspections. The move
has yet to be endorsed by Iraqs President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said the vote by Iraq's
parliament amounted to "political rhetoric," and Washington would
"watch Iraqi actions, not their words."
</P>
<P>
"At this point this is political rhetoric on Iraq's part. We'll
pay more attention to what they do than what they say," Crowley
said.
</P>
<P>
He call the vote a parliamentary recommendation to President
Saddam Hussein
</P>
<P>
"We watch Iraqis closely. We'll wait and see what their
behavior is," he added.
</P>
<P>
Crowley told reporters that the United States would "continue
to keep pressure on Saddam," noting that the latest action in
Baghdad would be a "clear violation" of U.N. resolutions on
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States would respond with troop
movements in the Gulf region, as it did when Iraq expelled U.N.
inspectors last year, Crowley again said the Clinton
administration would wait to hear from Butler when he presented a
report about the weapons inspections to the Security Council on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> No Plot Against Lesotho King: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Prime Minister
Pakalitha Mosisili Wednesday denied reports that his ruling party
Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) wanted to punish King Letsie
III and declare a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
"There are false rumors by leaders of the opposition parties,"
South African Press Association quoted Mosisili as telling the
country's National Assembly in Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili appealed to the leaders of the Lesotho National
Party, Basutoland Congress Party and Marematlou Freedom Party to
help restore peace and calm in the country, and to stop using
young people to break the law.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to ongoing protest by supporters of the three
parties in the streets of capital Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Protesters have been camping in front of the gates of the
Royal Palace since Tuesday morning to express their condemnation
of the results of Lesotho's May general elections.
</P>
<P>
The LCD won a landslide victory in the elections but the
opposition parties called it a fraud.
</P>
<P>
They are calling on King Letsie III to intervene, following
disclosures, based on an audit of the May election results, that
the results were rigged in favor of the LCD.
</P>
<P>
The protesters have vowed to continue with their action until
the monarchy steps in.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations turned violent Wednesday when police used
rubber bullets and water canyon to disperse protesters, according
to South Africa's national television, the SABC.
</P>
<P>
Police had to close the gates of the National Assembly to stop
the crowd from entering.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili was taken hostage for an hour after he made his
speech in parliament, said SABC.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili is expected to meet the king later Wednesday, for
what government officials have called "regular Wednesday
briefings."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lesotho government said Wednesday that it would
leave enforcement of the law and control of the demonstrations to
the police, but stressed it would not allow the situation to
threaten the country's peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> Emir of Qatar Wraps up Visit to Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa Al-Thani left here Wednesday ending a two-day working
visit after the signing of a bilateral cooperation agreement and
discussions of regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The visit was at the invitation of Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual.
</P>
<P>
Algeria News Agency quoted a joint Algerian-Qatari press
statement, issued at the end of the visit, as saying that both
sides expressed their profound satisfaction with the sustainable
development in bilateral ties and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two countries signed a pact prohibiting
double taxation and endorsed the first executive program of an
educational and scientific pact as well as an accord providing for
setting up a joint businessmen council.
</P>
<P>
The two sides condemned terrorism in all forms as it causes the
killing of innocent people and the wasting of local potentials and
energies as well as impedes the social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, both parties expressed their satisfaction with
the endorsing of the Arab Anti-Terrorism Treaty in Cairo last
April, and appealed for the respective states to put it into
effect. They also called for promoting cooperation in this domain.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari side paid tribute to the Algerian efforts to root
out terrorism. Both sides expressed their satisfaction with the
mounting international awareness of the necessity to fight
terrorism and eliminate its roots.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed concern over the fact that some countries
allow terrorists to practice illegal activities against other
countries.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, the two sides held Israelis
responsible for the stalled process, denouncing the Israeli
expansionist policy in the Arab occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, both sides stressed the need for making the Middle
East a mass destruction weapons-free region, specially from
nuclear weapons and called for Israel's endorsement on the Nuclear
Non Proliferation Treaty.

<P>
LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Contact has been re-established
with the one-billion-dollar Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO) satellite following six weeks of silence.
</P>
<P>
Signals sent from a station in Canberra, Australia, were
answered by SOHO in the form of intermittent bursts of signal
lasting from two to 10 seconds and do not contain any data
information.
</P>
<P>
However, "they show that the spacecraft is still capable of
receiving and responding to ground commands," according to a press
release from the European Space Agency (ESA).
</P>
<P>
The ESA said that the slow process of regaining control of SOHO
and restoring it to an operational attitude will start
immediately, with attempts to initiate data transmissions in order
to perform an initial assessment of the spacecraft on-board
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Radio contact with SOHO, a joint mission of the ESA and the
U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), was
interrupted on 25 June.
</P>
<P>
Last week, radio telescopes on Earth detected the SOHO
satellite, which is found apparently rotating slowly near to its
monitoring point in space and seems to have suffered only minimal
damage.

<HEADLINE> Nile Flooding Displaces 20,000 in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Flood waters from River Nile
caused by recent heavy rains have displaced some 20,000 people
over a wide area in Northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The rotten vegetation resulted from last year's torrential
rains brought about by the El Nino weather pattern and the washed
away shoreline have formed a huge blockage of the river, Radio
Uganda reported Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Earth and rocks have moved down stream, causing blockage and
flooding in Apac District, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The flooded junction is situated where the river flows out of
Lake Kwania about 200 kms from the source of the Nile at Lake
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The combination of vegetation and land mass is reported to
cover an area of more than 96 square kms.
</P>
<P>
According to Action Aid Emergency Officer Amanya Ebye, the
floodwater, worsened by recent rains, has moved two kms inland in
some places, covering grazing and farmlands and submerging whole
villages.
</P>
<P>
As a result, fishermen along the river have recorded lower
catches and trade is at a standstill because of impassable roads.
There is increased incidence of cholera in the area.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the long term effects of the flooding could
include famine and more human migration from the affected area.

LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The first terrorist prisoners in

</P>
<P>
The Sentence Review Commissioners, appointed to implement the

Those to be released include members of the Irish Republican
Army, which had fought for years to end British rule in Northern
Ireland, and the pro-British Ulster Defense Association and Ulster
Volunteer Force.

<HEADLINE> First World Conference of Ministers Responsible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The challenges and
opportunities facing young people today and in the future will be
the focus of deliberations when representatives of some 140
nations gather in Lisbon from 8 to 12 August, UN Department of
Public Information said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This high-level meeting, convened by the Government of Portugal
and the United Nations and the first World Conference of Ministers
Responsible for youth, is the culminating event of more than a
decade-long process undertaken to turn the attention of national
and global leaders to the matters of importance to young people.
</P>
<P>
The international movement began during the 1985 international
Youth Year with the General Assembly's adoption of a global agenda
in support of national youth policies. Then in 1995, the General
Assembly adopted the World Program of Action for Youth to the
Year 2000 and Beyond, which clearly defines strategies and targets
for youth-related actions.
</P>
<P>
The world's youth -- people between 15 and 24 years old -- make
up nearly one fifth of the population. They are more than 1
billion people, mostly living in developing nations, striving to
be healthy, educated and active participants in their communities.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day conference, participants will decide on
further ways that governments and society can respond more
effectively to the economic, social, educational, emotional,
cultural and spiritual needs of young people.
</P>
<P>
The most visible goal for delegates to the world conference is
to finalize and then adopt a declaration by which their
governments would commit to fortify national policies to benefits
their youthful populations.
</P>
<P>
States would agree to enhance youth participation in all
spheres of society; ensure the right to development of all young
people; strengthen the role of youth in peace-building, conflict
prevention and conflict resolution; promote education, full
employment and health; and address drug and substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
The conference, in additional to being the first international
meeting of ministers of youth, is the first conference to be held
by a Member State in coordination with the United Nations. Under
this new cost-saving measure, all expenses are being borne
entirely by the Government of Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliament Approves Budget for 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's National Assembly on
Wednesday approved a 4.35 billion Kuwaiti dinars (14.36 billion
U.S. dollars) budget for the fiscal year 1998-99 starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
The budget projected state revenues at 2.44 billion dinars
(8.06 billion dollars), and deficit at 2.16 billion dinars (7.13
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Oil revenues were estimated at 1.89 billion dinars (6.24
billion dollars) and non-oil revenues at 550 million dinars (1.82
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, over 244 million dinars (806 million dollars) will go
to the Fund for Future Generations, which was designed to prepare
for the time when Kuwait's oil passes its heyday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency, the budget was passed
with change by a vote of 33-0, with one abstention.
</P>
<P>
The oil-rich Gulf country was hit hard by sliding oil prices on
the world market, which leads to a more than 50 percent increase
in budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Net deficit for the fiscal year 1987-88 was set at 1.27 billion
dinars (4.2 billion dollars) while the total budget was 4.38
billion dinars (14.45 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the budget, up to 1.35 dinars (4.46 billion
dollars) goes for salaries, and 316.5 million dinars (1.04 billion
dollars) for services and commodities requirements.
</P>
<P>
Transportation, equipment and installations will receive 38
million dinars (1.25 billion dollars) while 434.5 million dinars
(1.43 billion dollars) is earmarked for structural projects,
maintenance and public ownerships.
</P>
<P>
As much as 2.24 billion dinars (7.42 billion dollars) is for
various expenditures and transfer payments.

running according to plan and had in no way been speeded up, said
Germany's envoy for Bosnian refugee affair, Dietmar Schlee,
Wednesday in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Of the 85,000 Bosnian refugees who left Germany in the first
seven months of this year, only about 1,200 had been expelled,
Schlee said. "There are no mass expulsions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Germany has taken in a total of 350,000 Bosnian refugees since
the Bosnian civil war broke out in 1992. About 140,000 of those
refugees are still living in Germany currently, according to
Schlee.
</P>
<P>
The consistent return of refugees was also good for Bosnia's
reconstruction, Schlee said, adding that German authorities and
humanitarian organizations were now active in about 80 projects in
Bosnia to help rebuild the country.

<P>
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior U.S. government
official told the German news agency DPA on Tuesday that Germany's
"coercive" repatriation of refugees from the former Yugoslavia
threatened to destroy the hard-won Bosnian peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also linked Bonn's hardline policy to the upcoming German
national elections on September 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, Robert
Gelbard, also told DPA that Washington was prepared to work with
Germany in the period after the September election to work out a
managed repatriation program.
